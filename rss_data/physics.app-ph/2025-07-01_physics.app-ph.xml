      <title>Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to fracture incorporating any convex strength criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational phase-field model of fracture capable of accounting for arbitrary closed convex strength domains.
  Unlike traditional models based on Ambrosio and Tortorelli regularization, the phase-field variable does not affect the material stiffness.
  Instead, our elastic energy exhibits linear growth outside a strength domain, which shrinks to 0 as the phase-field variable goes to 1.
  We characterize this model through a fundamental problem on a cube subject to boundary loads.
  We show that the solution of this problem is a transverse cohesive crack, provided that the applied load and the direction of the displacement jumps satisfy a compatibility criterion, which we formulate in terms of Mohr's circles for isotropic strength domains.
  This allows us to derive a hierarchy of strength criteria for which fracture is never possible, sometimes possible or always possible, depending on the direction of the stress tensor.
  We discuss the properties of the model and postulate a ``sharp-interface'' limit in the form of a cohesive law that can be explicitly derived from the form of the phase-field model.
  We give several examples of phase-field models and their cohesive limits.
  The proposed framework unifies within a single consistent variational theory key concepts developed over the centuries to predict or prevent material failure: Griffith and cohesive crack models, damage models, plasticity, strength criteria, and limit analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Metasurfaces with M-Type Ferrites: Shaping the Future of mmWave Absorption and Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review and tutorial on multi-functional metasurfaces integrated with M-type ferrite materials for millimeter-wave (mmWave) absorption and beam control. As wireless communication systems transition toward beyond-5G architectures, including non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), the demand for adaptive, low-profile electromagnetic surfaces that can manage interference while enabling beam reconfiguration becomes increasingly critical. Conventional metasurfaces often struggle to simultaneously achieve high absorption and beamforming over wide frequency ranges due to intrinsic material and structural limitations. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in metasurface design for dual-functionality, particularly those combining frequency-selective magnetic materials with periodic surface lattices, to enable passive, compact, and reconfigurable reflectors and absorbers. Special emphasis is placed on the role of M-type ferrites in enhancing absorption via ferromagnetic resonance, and on the use of surface-wave trapping mechanisms to achieve narrowband and broadband functionality. A case study of a ferrite-based hybrid "reflectsorber" (reflectorarray + absorber) is presented to demonstrate key design concepts, analytical models, and application scenarios relevant to satellite, UAV, and NTN ground station deployments. Future directions for low-loss, tunable, and scalable metasurfaces in next-generation wireless infrastructures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation by rotation described by a new type of Levitron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors[1][2] have highlighted a novel magnetic levitation phenomenon utilizing two magnetically equivalent permanent neodymium magnets. We propose that this system represents an analog of a scaled-up version of a Levitron[3][4]. The main distinction between these systems lies in the fact that the radius $m_/\mu_f$ now is a function of the lateral displacement $\delta_R$, and the adjustment required for magnetic trapping is not determined by the rotation speed of the float. Using an effective model, we demonstrate that the observed levitation effect can be explained within the framework of [3][4], and the condition for the potential energy to be at a minimum at the trapping point is achieved with the existence of a constraint on the $\delta_R$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature AFM with a microwave cavity optomechanical transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate AFM imaging with a microcantilever force transducer where an integrated superconducting microwave resonant circuit detects cantilever deflection using the principles of cavity optomechanics. We discuss the detector responsivity and added noise pointing to its crucial role in the context of force sensitivity. Through analysis of noise measurements we determine the effective temperature of the cantilever eigenmode and we determine the region of detector operation in which the sensor is thermal-noise limited. Our analysis shows that the force-sensor design is a significant improvement over piezoelectric force sensors commonly used in low-temperature AFM. We discuss the potential for further improvement of the sensor design to achieve optimal detection at the standard quantum limit. We demonstrate AFM operation with surface-tracking feedback in both amplitude-modulation and frequency-modulation modes.</description>

      <title>Snap-Through Thermomechanical Metamaterials for High-Performance Thermal Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal diodes that enable directional heat transport are essential for advanced thermal management in microelectronics, energy systems, and thermal logic devices. However, existing designs based on phase-change materials, nanostructures, or interfacial engineering suffer from limited rectification performance, configurational inflexibility, and poor scalability. Here, we present a thermomechanical metamaterial-based thermal diode that combines temperature-responsive actuation with structural bistability to achieve high-efficiency, nonreciprocal thermal transport. The device integrates shape memory alloy (SMA) springs with pre-buckled copper strips that undergo snap-through transitions in response to thermal gradients. This reconfiguration enables contact-based conduction in the forward mode and suppresses reverse heat flow via radiative isolation. We develop a coupled analytical model combining Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and a thermal resistance network, and validate the system through finite element (FE) simulations and experiments. The device achieves a thermal rectification ratio exceeding 900, with robust cycling stability and structural integrity. A modular stacking strategy further enhances scalability without compromising performance. This work establishes a new design framework for high-performance, passive thermal rectifiers that bridge mechanical metamaterials and advanced thermal engineering.</description>

      <title>A Self-Decoupling Mechanism for Closely Spaced Stacked Microstrip Patch Antenna Pair with Co-Directional Surface Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple and cost-effective broadband self-decoupling mechanism to mitigate strong mutual coupling in tightly stacked patch antenna pairs. Unlike conventional decoupling approaches that rely on oppositely directed surface currents between parasitic and driven patches, the proposed method achieves broadband self-decoupling under co-directional surface current distributions by introducing an embedded ultra-narrow metallic coupling line between adjacent parasitic patches. This design effectively mitigates boresight gain reduction and total efficiency degradation typically introduced by conventional decoupling techniques, without requiring additional decoupling circuits or complex fabrication processes. In a tightly spaced two-element array, the proposed method enhances isolation by 16.9 dB across the 5G NR N78 band, reaching a maximum improvement of 40.2 dB. It also supports compact adjacent-band MIMO systems, maintaining mutual coupling levels below -20 dB for antennas operating across both the N77 and N78 bands. Experimental validation on three representative configurations confirms the broadband self-decoupling capability and practical applicability of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Modelling effective electrical resistance in particle reinforced composites using Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer matrix composites embedded with conductive particles are widely utilized for applications that demand stringent control of the effective electrical resistance (or conductivity) of the material. This property is highly sensitive to the particle shape and size distribution within the composite and their percolation threshold. One of the most widely utilized numerical strategies to model this property is the Resistor Network method. However, it is based on many assumptions of the particle shape and inter-particle contact which limits its practical applications. In this work, we have proposed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based modelling strategy that can accurately capture the flow of electrical current through particles which are connected to multiple other particles in the matrix. The cGAN is trained on data generated by finite element simulations that can model the physics of the problem accurately. It is shown that the GAN based model predicts the electrical flow within the composite and hence the effective electrical resistance much more accurately than the Resistor Network model.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance effect based on spin-selective transport in nanodevices using chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been observed in chiral molecules and is attractive for application in magnetoresistance (MR) devices. In this study, we fabricate CISS-based nanodevices consisting of chiral molecules sandwiched between Ni78Fe22 and Au electrodes. Prior to device fabrication, we have synthesized the chiral molecule N-(3S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene-2-carboxyamide (S-BTBT-CONHR) and established a method for fabricating nanodevice electrodes. We have successfully observed a high degree of spin selectivity in S-BTBT-CONHR thin films using magnetic conductive atomic force microscopy (mc-AFM). By combining chiral molecules with our advanced nanofabrication technique, we have successfully fabricated Au/S-BTBT-CONHR/Ni78Fe22 nanodevices and observed the MR effect in the fabricated devices under a low magnetic field at room temperature. These MR curves correspond to the magnetization states of the Ni78Fe22 electrode, indicating that the CISS-based MR effect is successfully observed in the nanodevices under a low magnetic field. This study can lead to the development of CISS-based MR devices under low magnetic fields and provide new insights into the CISS effect mechanism on devices.</description>

      <title>Acoustic-Assisted Fabrication of Thin Shells with Spatially Distributed Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-shell structures, found in biological systems such as beetle carapaces and widely used in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering, achieve remarkable strength-to-mass ratio given their slenderness and curved geometries. However, their load-bearing capacity is highly sensitive to geometric imperfections, which are often unavoidable during fabrication and can trigger subcritical buckling. Silicone-based hemispherical domes have served as an experimental modal system to study this phenomenon, yet prior work has largely focused on localized dimples or flat imperfections, failing to capture the spatially distributed nature of real-world imperfection patterns. Here, we introduce an acoustic-assisted method for fabricating thin shells with spatially distributed, vibrational mode-shaped imperfections. Silicone is cast onto a thick elastic mold excited by a speaker, and vibration-induced flow during curing creates thickness variations. High-speed imaging and microCT scanning reveal accumulation of material at the antinodes of the mold's vibrational modes. We show that imperfection geometry can be tuned by acoustic frequency, while their amplitude increases with acoustic volume. Buckling experiments demonstrate significant reductions in critical pressure, offering a scalable platform to study and tune imperfection-sensitive mechanics. Beyond shell mechanics, we offer a scalable and tunable fabrication method for patterning soft materials in applications ranging from morphable surfaces to bioinspired design.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework for Siting Fusion Energy Facilities: Application and Evaluation of U.S. Coal Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for siting fusion energy facilities, integrating expert judgment, geospatial data, and multi-criteria decision making tools to evaluate site suitability systematically. As a case study, we apply this framework to all currently operational coal power plant sites in the United States to examine their potential for hosting future fusion facilities at a time when these coal plants are shut down on reaching their end of life - timelines which are expected to coincide with the potential deployment of fusion energy facilities. Drawing on 22 siting criteria - including state and federal policies, risk and hazard assessments, and spatial and infrastructural parameters - we implement two MultiCriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods: the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM) to derive attribute weights and the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to rank sites based on composite suitability scores. By focusing on fusion-specific siting needs and demonstrating the framework through a coal site application, this study contributes a scalable and transparent decision-support tool for identifying optimal fusion energy deployment locations.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Synthesis of Mithrene and its Application in 2D Heterostructure UV Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver phenylselenide (AgSePh), known as mithrene, is a two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic chalcogenide (MOC) semiconductor with a wide direct band gap, narrow blue emission and in-plane anisotropy. However, its application in next-generation optoelectronics is limited by crystal size and orientation, as well as challenges in large-area growth. Here, we introduce a controlled tarnishing step on the silver surface prior to the solid-vapor-phase chemical transformation into AgSePh thin films. Mithrene thin films were prepared through thermally assisted conversion (TAC) at 100{\deg}C, incorporating a pre-tarnishing water (H${_2}$O) vapor pulse and propylamine (PrNH${_2}$) as a coordinating ligand to modulate Ag${^+}$ ion reactivity and facilitate the conversion of Ph${_2}$Se${_2}$ into an active intermediate. The AgSePh thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The pre-tarnishing process, combined with organic ligands, resulted in large crystals exceeding 1 ${\mu}$m and improved homogeneous in-plane orientation, while also enabling the selective, wafer-scale synthesis of mithrene on 100 mm wafers. Furthermore, the films were integrated on planar graphene field-effect phototransistors (GFETs) and demonstrated photoresponsivity beyond 100 A/W at 450 nm, highlighting mithrene's potential for blue light-detection applications.</description>

      <title>Extending OpenMC Validation to Spent Fuel Canisters: A Criticality Benchmark Against MCNP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenMC is an open-source Monte Carlo code with increasing relevance in criticality safety and reactor physics applications. While its validation has covered a broad range of systems, its performance in spent nuclear fuel storage scenarios remains limited in the literature. This work benchmarks OpenMC against MCNP for eleven configurations based on the KBS-3 disposal concept, involving variations in geometry, fuel composition (fresh vs spent), and environmental conditions (e.g., air, argon, flooding scenarios). Effective multiplication factors (k-eff) and leakage fractions were evaluated for both codes. Results show strong agreement, with code-to-code k-eff differences below 0.8% in dry storage conditions, and consistent trends across all cases. Notably, OpenMC successfully captures inter-canister neutron interaction effects under periodic boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability to dry storage configurations. This benchmark supports the extension of the validation domain of OpenMC toward SNF transport and disposal applications.</description>

      <title>Simplified Aluminum Nitride Processing for Low-Loss Integrated Photonics and Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum nitride (AlN) is an extremely promising material for integrated photonics because of the combination of strong \c{hi}2 and \c{hi}3 nonlinearities. However, the intrinsic hardness of the material and charging effects during electron beam lithography make AlN nanofabrication a challenging process. Conventional approaches often require multiple hard masks and a metal mask to fabricate nanostructures. In this letter, we report a novel, simple method to fabricate AlN microresonators by using a single layer of silicon nitride mask combined with a thin conductive polymer layer. The conductive layer can be conveniently removed during developing without requiring an additional etching step. We achieve high intrinsic quality (Q) factors up to one million in AlN microresonators and demonstrate several nonlinear phenomena within our devices, including frequency comb generation, Raman lasing, third harmonic generation and supercontinuum generation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic film thickness measurement in a rolling bearing using numerical elastohydrodynamic-acoustic modelling to interpret reflected ultrasound data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thickness of the lubricating film plays a vital role in the operational efficiency and reliability of rolling bearings. Ultrasonic reflection techniques offer a promising non-invasive approach for in situ evaluation of lubricant films.However, accurately identifying the central film thickness remains challenging due to several complex factors, including dynamic fluctuations, localized elastic deformation, cavitation effects, and variations in oil supply. This study presents a comprehensive theoretical and numerical framework to elucidate the influence of these factors on ultrasonic wave propagation in lubricated contacts. Numerical simulations considering elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime and cavitation-induced effects are carried out to obtain the surface deformation profiles and the cavitation regions. Subsequently, high-fidelity acoustic simulations are conducted to interpret reflected ultrasound data.As main results, the EHL leads to a "double-peak with central valley" pattern in the reflection coefficient distribution. While the cavitation causes the central valley to shift toward the inlet region and increases the reflection coefficient.Accordingly, the central film thickness is extracted from the distribution of the reflection coefficient under different operating conditions. Experimental validation using both glass-oil-steel and steel-oil-steel bearing setups confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. The high-resolution fluorescence measurement adopted in the glass-oil-steel configuration validates the simulation of the reflection coefficient distribution. Furthermore, the theoretical EHL calculations are employed with the steel-oil-steel configuration for validation of the measurement accuracy of central oil film thickness.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Temperature Vacuum Prober for Electrical and Thermal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an ultra-high-temperature vacuum probe station (UHT-VPS) featuring a sample holder heated by thermal radiation from a silicon carbide heater. This contactless configuration electrically isolates the sample from the high-power heating source through a vacuum gap, ensuring reliable measurements under extreme conditions. The capability of this UHT-VPS to measure electrical signals from 30 nV upward on bulk sapphire is demonstrated using the 3w/2w method. Measurements are continuously operated from 300 to 1150 K, under high vacuum, for a total of about 66 hours without readjusting the contact. They yield the linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of resistance of chromium/platinum micro-resistances, as well as the sapphire's thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. By recording the heater and sensor temperature signals up to 30 kHz and fitting them with theoretical models that account for the quadratic TCR of Cr/Pt microwires, we obtain values in agreement with literature data obtained by optical methods. In this temperature range, we also measure thermal conductivity, which cannot be directly accessed by optical techniques. Our system thus provides an effective solution for simultaneously retrieving the electrical and thermal properties of materials using a single set of 3w/2w data up to unprecedented temperature levels.</description>

      <title>Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Engineering: A New Key to Enhancing Ceramic Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystalline solids and often exert a significant influence on the mechanical properties of metals. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using dislocations in ceramics to enhance materials performance. However, dislocation engineering has frequently been deemed uncommon in ceramics owing to the brittle nature of ceramics. Contradicting this conventional view, various approaches have been used to introduce dislocations into ceramic materials without crack formation, thereby paving the way for controlled ceramics performance. However, the influence of dislocations on functional properties is equally complicated owing to the intricate structure of ceramic materials. Furthermore, despite numerous experiments and simulations investigating dislocation-controlled properties in ceramics, comprehensive reviews summarizing the effects of dislocations on ceramics are still lacking. This review focuses on some representative dislocation-controlled properties of ceramic materials, including mechanical and some key functional properties, such as transport, ferroelectricity, thermal conductivity, and superconducting properties. A brief integration of dislocations in ceramic is anticipated to offer new insights for the advancement of dislocation engineering across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architected materials that harness elastic snap-through buckling can trap energy reversibly. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit excellent dissipation capabilities due to polymer network viscoelasticity and rate-dependent soft stress behavior associated with mesogen rotation. Incorporating LCEs into buckling lattice structures enhances energy absorption; however, conventional design cannot take advantage of the dissipation mechanism associated with mesogen rotation because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold of the soft stress response. In this study, we investigate tension-induced mesogen rotation as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic user-defined element was implemented in Abaqus/Standard to capture finite-strain behavior, including soft stress effects. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. Energy contributions from mesogen rotation and polymer network viscoelasticity were quantified. These findings inform the design strategies for LCE-based architected materials to enhance dissipation.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Ultra-Wide-Bandgap CaSnO3 Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-voltage and high-power electronic applications has intensified the search for novel ultrawide bandgap (UWB) semiconductors. Alkaline earth stannates possess wide band gaps and exhibit the highest room-temperature electron mobilities among all perovskite oxides. Among this family, Calcium stannate (CaSnO3) has the largest band gap of ~4.7 eV, holding great promise for high-power applications. However, the demonstration of CaSnO3 power electronic devices is so far limited. In this work, high-performance metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices based on La-doped CaSnO3 are demonstrated for the first time. The MOSFETs exhibit an on/off ratio exceeding 10^8, along with field-effect mobility of 8.4 cm2 V-1 s-1 and on-state current of 30 mA mm-1. The high performance of the CaSnO3 MOSFET devices can be ascribed to the excellent metal-to-semiconductor contact resistance of 0.73 k{\Omega}{\mu}m. The devices also show great potential for harsh environment operations, as high-temperature operations up to 400 K have been demonstrated. An off-state breakdown voltage of 1660 V is achieved, with a breakdown field of ~8.3 MV cm-1 among the highest reported for all UWB semiconductors. This work represents significant progress toward realizing the practical application of CaSnO3 in future high-voltage power electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</description>

Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</description>

      <title>GeSn 320 \times 256 Focal Plane Array for Silicon-Based Short-wave Infrared Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging arrays have demonstrated great potential in applications spanning from military to civilian consumer electronics. However, the current focal plane arrays (FPAs), which are based on compound semiconductors, have limited applications in civilian circumstances due to elevated manufacturing costs and prolonged fabrication cycle time. To address this, a high-performance 320 $\times$ 256 focal plane array based on group-IV semiconductors has been designed and manufactured on a Si substrate using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible fabrication process. The optical absorption layer is composed of GeSn alloy, whose bandgap could be tailored by choosing the appropriate Sn concentration. In this work, a 10% Sn concentration was employed, yielding a response cutoff wavelength of 2308 nm for the Si-based photodetector, which was measured at 298 K. Moreover, a specific detectivity of 9.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$\cdot$ Hz$^{1/2}$ $\cdot$ W$^{-1}$ has been achieved at 77 K, surpassing all previously reported GeSn devices, and rivals commercial extended InGaAs photodetectors. With the help of read-out circuits (ROIC), SWIR images have been successfully captured for the first time by using Si-based GeSn FPA. This work demonstrates the potential of group IV imaging arrays for various applications in the commercial SWIR imaging field.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Statistical RF Fields at High Magnetic Field with a Quantum Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data traffic is accelerating the need for ultra-broadband communication technologies, particularly in cloud infrastructure and emerging 6G wireless systems. Optical computing and quantum information processing also demand fast, scalable ways to interface optical and electronic signals. Integrated electro-optic modulators provide a compact and efficient solution, but extending their operation into the millimeterwave (mmWave) range with wide bandwidth and compatibility with wireless signals remains a significant challenge. Bulky electrical packaging and high mmWave losses remain primary barriers to scalability. Here, we demonstrate a wireless and wideband electro-optic modulation architecture that directly interfaces mmWaves with optical signals, eliminating the need for impedance-matched mmWave probes and cables. By integrating an on-chip antenna with a co-designed transmission line on thin-film lithium niobate platform, we achieve wideband modulation across the WR9.0 (82-125 GHz) and WR2.8 (240-380 GHz) bands. The wideband nature of our modulator enables the device to function as a high-speed detector of mmWave carriers modulated up to 6~GHz and achieves a flat and wide response, a key requirement for 6G and high-speed mmWave sensing. By configuring the antenna-coupled transmission line to operate as a cavity, our wireless platform enables triply resonant electro-optic frequency comb generation with mode spacing of 123.2 GHz and 307.9 GHz. Extracted single-photon electro-optic coupling rates of $g_{0} =2\pi\times 4.98$ kHz and $2\pi\times 9.93$ kHz, at 123.2 and 307.9 GHz, respectively, demonstrate favorable scaling with mmWave frequency. These results introduce a new class of wireless electro-optic devices for high-speed modulation, detection, and frequency comb generation, with impactful applications in communications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21279</link>

Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Furthermore, CuInP$_2$S$_6$ exhibits a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of any known material in this wavelength regime. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>
