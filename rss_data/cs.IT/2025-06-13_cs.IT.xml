      <title>A Survey of Data Compression Algorithms and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, with the growing demands of information storage and data transfer, data compression is becoming increasingly important. Data Compression is a technique which is used to decrease the size of data. This is very useful when some huge files have to be transferred over networks or being stored on a data storage device and the size is more than the capacity of the data storage or would consume so much bandwidth for transmission in a network. With the advent of the Internet and mobile devices with limited resources, data compression has gained even more importance. It can be effectively used to save both storage and bandwidth, thus to decrease download duration. Data compression can be achieved by a host of techniques. During this survey, I'm going to thoroughly discuss some of important data compression algorithms, their performance evaluation, and their major applications along with today's issues and recent research approaches.</description>

      <title>HiKO: A Hierarchical Framework for Beyond-Second-Order KO Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces HiKO (Hierarchical Kronecker Operation), a novel framework for training high-rate neural error-correcting codes that enables KO codes to outperform Reed-Muller codes beyond second order. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extend KO codes beyond second order. While conventional KO codes show promising results for low-rate regimes ($r &lt; 2$), they degrade at higher rates -- a critical limitation for practical deployment. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical training methodology that decomposes complex high-rate codes into simpler constituent codes for efficient knowledge transfer, (2) enhanced neural architectures with dropout regularization and learnable skip connections tailored for the Plotkin structure, and (3) a progressive unfreezing strategy that systematically transitions from pre-trained components to fully optimized integrated codes. Our experiments show that HiKO codes consistently outperform traditional Reed-Muller codes across various configurations, achieving notable performance improvements for third-order ($r = 3$) and fourth-order ($r = 4$) codes. Analysis reveals that HiKO codes successfully approximate Shannon-optimal Gaussian codebooks while preserving efficient decoding properties. This represents the first successful extension of KO codes beyond second order, opening new possibilities for neural code deployment in high-throughput communication systems.</description>

      <title>DeepPolar+: Breaking the BER-BLER Trade-off with Self-Attention and SMART (SNR-MAtched Redundancy Technique) decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code (DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Non-Adaptive Group Testing with One-Sided Error Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e., finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic structure of additive complementary pairs of cyclic codes over a finite commutative ring. We demonstrate that for every additive complementary pair of additive cyclic codes, both constituent codes are free modules. Moreover, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of additive cyclic codes over a finite commutative ring to form an additive complementary pair. Finally, we construct a complementary pair of additive cyclic codes over a finite chain ring and show that one of the codes is permutation equivalent to the trace dual of the other.</description>

      <title>Downlink CSIT under Compressed Feedback: Joint vs. Separate Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acquisition of Downlink (DL) channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is known to be a challenging task in multiuser massive MIMO systems when uplink/downlink channel reciprocity does not hold (e.g., in frequency division duplexing systems). From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at the users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be conveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The transmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by separate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using classical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical lower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and SSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of successive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would incur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case of minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based feedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to optimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace. We analyze the large SNR behavior of the proposed JSCC-based scheme in terms of the quality scaling exponent (QSE). Given the second-order statistics of channel estimation of any feedback scheme, we further derive the closed-form of the lower bound to the ergodic sum-rate for DL data transmission under maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing precoding. Via extensive numerical results, we show that our proposed JSCC-based scheme outperforms known JSCC, SSCC baseline and deep learning-based schemes and is able to approach the performance of the optimal DR scheme in the range of practical SNR.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Sensing Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight, resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.</description>

      <title>A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.</description>

      <title>Revisiting mean estimation over $\ell_p$ balls: Is the MLE optimal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of mean estimation on $\ell_p$ balls under additive Gaussian noise. When $p$ is strictly less than $2$, it is well understood that rate-optimal estimators must be nonlinear in the observations. In this work, we study the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which may be viewed as a nonlinear shrinkage procedure for mean estimation over $\ell_p$ balls. We demonstrate two phenomena for the behavior of the MLE, which depend on the noise level, the radius of the norm constraint, the dimension, and the norm index $p$. First, as a function of the dimension, for $p$ near $1$ or at least $2$, the MLE is minimax rate-optimal for all noise levels and all constraint radii. On the other hand, for $p$ between $1$ and $2$, there is a more striking behavior: for essentially all noise levels and radii for which nonlinear estimates are required, the MLE is minimax rate-suboptimal, despite being nonlinear in the observations. Our results also imply similar conclusions when given $n$ independent and identically distributed Gaussian samples, where we demonstrate that the MLE can be suboptimal by a polynomial factor in the sample size. Our lower bounds are constructive: whenever the MLE is rate-suboptimal, we provide explicit instances on which the MLE provably incurs suboptimal risk.</description>

      <title>Task Adaptation from Skills: Information Geometry, Disentanglement, and New Objectives for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>

      <title>Network-level ISAC: An Analytical Study of Antenna Topologies Ranging from Massive to Cell-Free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cooperative architecture is proposed for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, incorporating coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission along with multi-static sensing. We investigate how the allocation of antennas-to-base stations (BSs) affects cooperative sensing and cooperative communication performance. More explicitly, we balance the benefits of geographically concentrated antennas in the massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) fashion, which enhance beamforming and coherent processing, against those of geographically distributed antennas towards cell-free transmission, which improve diversity and reduce service distances. Regarding sensing performance, we investigate three localization methods: angle-of-arrival (AOA)-based, time-of-flight (TOF)-based, and a hybrid approach combining both AOA and TOF measurements, for critically appraising their effects on ISAC network performance. Our analysis shows that in networks having N ISAC nodes following a Poisson point process, the localization accuracy of TOF-based methods follows a \ln^2 N scaling law (explicitly, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) reduces with \ln^2 N). The AOA-based methods follow a \ln N scaling law, while the hybrid methods scale as a\ln^2 N + b\ln N, where a and b represent parameters related to TOF and AOA measurements, respectively. The difference between these scaling laws arises from the distinct ways in which measurement results are converted into the target location. Specifically, when converting AOA measurements to the target location, the localization error introduced during this conversion is inversely proportional to the distance between the BS and the target, leading to a more significant reduction in accuracy as the number of transceivers increases.</description>

Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) is a revolutionary flexible antenna technology designed to enhance wireless communication by establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, reducing free-space path loss and enabling antenna array reconfigurability. PASS uses dielectric waveguides with low propagation loss for signal transmission, radiating via a passive pinching antenna, which is a small dielectric element applied to the waveguide. This paper first proposes a physics-based hardware model for PASS, where the pinching antenna is modeled as an open-ended directional coupler, and the electromagnetic field behavior is analyzed using coupled-mode theory. A simplified signal model characterizes the coupling effect between multiple antennas on the same waveguide. Based on this, two power models are proposed: equal power and proportional power models. Additionally, a transmit power minimization problem is formulated/studied for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming under both continuous and discrete pinching antenna activations. Two algorithms are proposed to solve this multimodal optimization problem: the penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm and a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm. Numerical results show that 1) the ZF-based low-complexity algorithm performs similarly to the penalty-based algorithm, 2) PASS reduces transmit power by over 95% compared to conventional and massive MIMO, 3) discrete activation causes minimal performance loss but requires a dense antenna set to match continuous activation, and 4) the proportional power model yields performance comparable to the equal power model.</description>

      <title>Dilations and information flow axioms in categorical probability</title>

Abstract: We study the positivity and causality axioms for Markov categories as properties of dilations and information flow in Markov categories, and in variations thereof for arbitrary semicartesian monoidal categories. These help us show that being a positive Markov category is merely an additional property of a symmetric monoidal category (rather than extra structure). We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely. Finally, we note that positivity fails for quasi-Borel spaces and interpret this failure as a privacy property of probabilistic name generation.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieved privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, a good trade-off between privacy and precision can be observed.</description>

      <title>Decoding for Punctured Convolutional and Turbo Codes: A Deep Learning Solution for Protocols Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based decoding methods have shown promise in enhancing error correction performance, but traditional approaches struggle with the challenges posed by punctured codes. In particular, these methods fail to address the complexities of variable code rates and the need for protocol compatibility. This paper presents a unified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based decoding architecture specifically designed to overcome these challenges. The proposed method unifies punctured convolutional and Turbo codes. A puncture embedding mechanism integrates puncturing patterns directly into the network, enabling seamless adaptation to varying code rates, while balanced bit error rate training ensures robustness across different code lengths, rates, and channels, maintaining protocol flexibility. Extensive simulations in Additive White Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional decoding techniques, providing significant improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness. These results underscore the potential of LSTM-based decoding as a promising solution for next-generation artificial intelligence powered communication systems.</description>

      <title>Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Optimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the Holevo quantity arising from the fundamental entropic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the fundamental entropic inequality proved recently in [arXiv:2408.15306] can be applied to obtain a useful relation for the Holevo quantity of discrete and continuous ensembles of quantum states.
  This relation gives a tight upper bound on the Holevo quantity of a given ensemble $\mu$ expressed in terms of the Holevo quantities of two auxiliary ensembles $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$ produced by $\mu$. Among others, this implies quite accurate upper bounds on the Holevo quantity of a discrete ensemble of quantum states expressed via the probabilities and the metric characteristics of an ensemble.</description>
