      <title>Cooperative Behavior in Pre-State Societies: An Agent-Based Approach of the Aksum Civilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study intends to test the hypothesis that, contrary to traditional interpretation, the social structure of the polity of Aksum - especially in its early stages - was not characterized by a vertical hierarchy with highly centralized administrative power, and that the leaders mentioned in the few available inscriptions were predominantly ritual leaders with religious rather than coercive political authority. This hypothesis, suggested by the available archaeological evidence, is grounded in Charles Stanish's model, which posits that pre-state societies could achieve cooperative behavior without the presence of coercive authority. Using agent-based modeling applied to data inspired by the Aksum civilization, we examine the dynamics of cooperation in the presence and absence of a Public Goods Game. Results show that while cooperative behavior can emerge in the short term without coercive power, it may not be sustainable over the long term, suggesting a need for centralized authority to foster stable, complex societies. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary pathways that lead to state formation and complex social structures.</description>
