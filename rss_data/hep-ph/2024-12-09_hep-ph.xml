      <title>Recent Progress in Flavor Model Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor puzzles remain among the most compelling open questions in particle physics. The striking hierarchies observed in the masses and mixing of charged fermions define the Standard Model (SM) flavor puzzle, a profound structural enigma pointing to physics beyond the SM. Simultaneously, the absence of deviations from SM predictions in precision measurements of flavor-changing neutral currents imposes severe constraints on new physics at the TeV scale, giving rise to the new physics flavor puzzle. This review article provides an overview of a selection of recent advancements in flavor model building, with a particular focus on attempts to address one or both of these puzzles within the quark sector.</description>

      <title>Probing low-reheating scenarios with minimal freeze-in dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter space of freeze-in dark matter (DM) with mass $m_\chi$ through light dark photon (``minimal freeze-in DM'') is currently being probed by direct detection experiments through electron and nuclear recoil. Exploring the DM production in the mass range $10^{-2}~{\rm MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10^3$ TeV, we quantify the impact of quantum statistics and the reheating dynamics (beyond the instantaneous reheating approximation) on the DM production in the early universe, in particular, the dependence on the cosmic equation of state and the scaling of the temperature of the Standard Model bath during reheating. Special cases corresponding to matter-domination and kination are carefully studied. To fit the entire observed DM relic abundance, low-temperature reheating scenarios require an increase in the coupling between dark and visible sectors which, in turn, enhances the regions of the parameter space that are already tested and will be probed by next-generation direct detection experiments for diverse reheating scenarios.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Search in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the collider search limits on the charged Higgses in the four types of Two Higgs Double Models (2HDM). In addition to constraints from flavor physics measurements, we include both the LEP charged Higgs search channels, as well as the LHC search results on the light and heavy charged Higgses. We consider both the conventional charged Higgs search channels of $H^\pm \rightarrow \tau\nu, cs, cb, tb$, and the latest search results on the exotic decay channels $H^\pm \rightarrow A W^\pm / H W^\pm$. We find that $H^\pm \rightarrow A W^\pm / H W^\pm$ are complementary to the conventional fermionic channels for $m_{H^\pm} &lt; m_t$. For heavy $H^\pm$, $H^\pm \rightarrow A W^\pm / H W^\pm$ extend the reach of $\tan \beta$ beyond that of $H^\pm \to tb$ in the Type-L 2HDM. We also present the combined reach of all the neutral and charged Higgs searches.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <title>Tuning towards the edge of a dark abyss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that tuning towards the boundary of the positivity domain of the scalar potential may explain the separation between the electroweak scale and the unification scale in a grand unified theory. Here we explore the possibility that the same type of tuning might account for the generation of the electroweak scale from a much lighter dynamically generated scale in a dark sector. We present a model that realizes this idea and provides a proof of principle that the same dark sector can include a viable dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering in presence of non-standard interactions: cross sections and nucleon polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) may appear in the form of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). We have studied neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in presence of NSI. We obtain that in this scenario, nucleon matrix elements depend not only on the isovector axial nucleon form factor but also on the isoscalar one. For the axial form factors we consequently rely on the quark flavor decomposition performed by QCD simulations in the lattice (LQCD). We have examined cross sections and polarization observables. For the current bounds on diagonal muon flavor NSI couplings we find substantial deviations from the SM predictions in cross sections and transverse polarizations of the outgoing nucleons. In view of the progress in the precision of LQCD determinations of nucleon properties, modern measurements of neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering will be in the position to discover or significantly constrain NSI.</description>

      <title>Tripling Fluctuations and Peaked Sound Speed in Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crossover involving three-fermion clusters is relevant to the hadron-quark crossover, which, if occurring in a neutron star, could naturally reproduce the dense-matter equation of state recently deduced from simultaneous observations of neutron-star masses and radii. To understand the crossover mechanism, we examine the role of tripling fluctuations induced by the formation of three-fermion clusters. The phase-shift representation of fluctuations manifests an interplay of bound and scattering states, leading to non-monotonic momentum distributions of baryon-like clusters and peaked sound speed at finite densities. We demonstrate them by applying our approach to a nonrelativistic system of one-dimensional three-color fermions analogous to the hadron-quark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out the spatial density distributions corresponding to the axial-vector charge density operator for spin-1/2 systems using states described by sharply localized wave packets in arbitrary Lorentz-frames. The static approximation, leading to the frequently assumed Breit-frame distributions, is also considered. We discuss the interpretation of the resulting spatial densities in terms of the axial charge density.</description>

      <title>Coherent Axion Production through Laser Crystal Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between an optical laser and an ionic crystal, revealing a coherent enhancement in axion production when the laser is incident at specific angles. Additional enhancement is observed by stacking thin crystal films at particular separations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method for generating and detecting axions in terrestrial experiments, achieving up to a two-order-of-magnitude increase in transition probability compared to light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments with the same interaction region size. For an experiment length of 10 meters, this setup could lower the axion exclusion limit to $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim9.11\times10^{-12}\text{GeV}^{-1}$ after one year of data collection.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Setup and the Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach to QCD evolution based on the sequential Born-Oppenheimer approximations that include higher and higher frequency modes as the evolution parameter is increased. This Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group is a general approach which is valid for the high energy evolution as well as the evolution in transverse resolution scale $Q^2$. In the former case it yields the frequency ordered formulation of high energy evolution, which includes both the eikonal splittings which produce gluons with low longitudinal momentum, and the DGLAP-like splittings which produce partons with high transverse momentum. In this, first paper of the series we lay out the formulation of the approach, and derive the expression for the evolved wave function of a hadronic state. We also discuss the form of the $S$-matrix which is consistent with the frequency ordering.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: CSS, DGLAP and all that</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{one}, we have introduced the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) renormalization group approach to high energy hadronic collisions and derived the BO approximation for the light cone wave function of a fast moving projectile hadron. In this second paper, we utilize this wave function to derive the BO evolution of partonic distributions in the hadron -- the gluon transverse momentum and integrated parton distributions (TMD and PDF respectively). The evolution equation for the TMD contains a linear and a nonlinear term. The linear term reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) equation with a physical relation between the transverse and longitudinal resolution scales. We explain how this equivalence arises, even though the BO and CSS cascades are somewhat different in structures. The nonlinear term in the evolution has a very appealing physical meaning: it is a correction due to stimulated emission, which enhances emission of gluons (bosons) into states with a nonzero occupation.
  For the evolution of the PDF we again find a linear and nonlinear term. At not very small Bjorken $x$, the linear term recovers the DGLAP equation in the leading logarithmic approximation. At small $x$ however there are contributions from gluon splittings which are in the BFKL kinematics leading to a modification of the DGLAP equation. The nonlinear terms have the same physical origin as in the equation for the TMD -- the stimulated emission corrections. Interestingly the nonlinear corrections are the most important for the virtual terms, so that the net correction to the DGLAP is negative and mimics shadowing, although the physical origin of the nonlinearity is very different.</description>

      <title>Unveiling hadronic resonance dynamics at LHC energies: insights from EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances, with lifetimes of a few fm/\textit{c}, are key tools for studying the hadronic phase in high-energy collisions. This work investigates resonance production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV and in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.36$ TeV using the EPOS4 model, which can switch the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) ON and OFF, enabling the study of final-state hadronic interactions. We focus on hadronic resonances and the production of non-strange and strange hadrons, addressing effects like rescattering, regeneration, baryon-to-meson production, and strangeness enhancement, using transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra and particle ratios. Rescattering and strangeness effects are important at low $p_\rm{T}$, while baryon-to-meson ratios dominate at intermediate $p_\rm{T}$. A strong mass-dependent radial flow is observed in the most central Pb$-$Pb collisions. The average $p_\rm{T}$, scaled with reduced hadron mass (mass divided by valence quarks), shows a deviation from linearity for short-lived resonances. By analyzing the yield ratios of short-lived resonances to stable hadrons in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions, we estimate the time duration ($\tau$) of the hadronic phase as a function of average charged multiplicity. The results show that $\tau$ increases with multiplicity and system size, with a nonzero value in high-multiplicity pp collisions. Proton (p), strange ($\rm{\Lambda}$), and multi-strange ($\rm{\Xi}$, $\rm{\Omega}$) baryon production in central Pb$-$Pb collisions is influenced by strangeness enhancement and baryon-antibaryon annihilation. Comparing with LHC measurements offers insights into the dynamics of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino mass ordering with supernova neutrinos at NO$\nu$A including the effect of sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of probing the mass ordering sensitivity as a function of supernova distance in the context of the ongoing neutrino experiment NO$\nu$A. We provide a detailed study of the active-active and active-sterile mixing frameworks, illustrating how supernova neutrinos can be used to realize the existence of sterile neutrinos. Interestingly, we infer that observation of the NC channel alone can differentiate between the presence and absence of sterile neutrinos. Our study reveals that in the presence of sterile neutrinos, the mass hierarchy sensitivity is significantly reduced compared to the active-active framework for the NC channel. Our results indicate that the primary channel of NO$\nu$A can distinguish normal mass hierarchy from inverted mass hierarchy at $5 \sigma$ confidence level for a supernova explosion occurring at a distance of 5 kpc. Additionally, we examine the impact of systematic uncertainties on mass hierarchy sensitivity, showing that higher levels of systematics lead to a reduction in sensitivity. Similarly, the inclusion of energy smearing significantly diminishes hierarchy sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of intrinsic motion of partons and soft gluon emissions in Drell-Yan production studied with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic transverse momentum (intrinsic-$k_T$) of partons within colliding hadrons, typically modeled with a Gaussian distribution characterized by a specific width (the intrinsic-$k_T$ width), has been an extremely challenging issue. This difficulty arises because event generators like Pythia require an intrinsic-$k_T$ width that unexpectedly varies with collision energy, reaching unphysical values at high energies. This paper investigates the underlying physics behind this energy dependence in Pythia, revealing that it arises from an interplay between two non-perturbative processes: the internal transverse motion of partons and non-perturbative soft gluon emissions. These contributions are most constrained in the production of Drell-Yan pairs with very low transverse momentum, where soft gluon effects become increasingly prominent with rising collision energy-contrary to initial expectations. Through a detailed analysis of the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor and its influence on intrinsic-$k_T$ width, we clarify the observed energy scaling behavior in Pythia, providing insight into a longstanding issue in parton shower modeling.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effective-field-theory approach, the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei depends on a set of effective operators mediating the lepton-flavor-violating interaction at a high scale, renormalization group corrections that describe the evolution to lower scales, and hadronic and nuclear matrix elements that turn quark-level interactions into hadronic ones and then embed the latter into nuclear responses. In particular, combining information from $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu\to 3e$, and $\mu\to e $ conversion in nuclei, it becomes possible to disentangle different underlying sources of lepton flavor violation. However, to assess the discriminatory power it is critical that uncertainties at each step of the analysis be controlled and fully quantified. In this regard, nuclear response functions related to the coupling to neutrons are notoriously problematic, since they are not directly constrained by experiment. We address these shortcomings by combining ab initio calculations with a recently improved determination of charge distributions from electron scattering by exploiting strong correlations among charge, point-proton, and point-neutron radii and densities. We present overlap integrals for $^{27}$Al, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ti including full covariance matrices, allowing, for the first time, for a comprehensive consideration of nuclear structure uncertainties in the interpretation of $\mu\to e$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Study of the deuterons emission time in pp collisions at the LHC via kaon-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The femtoscopy correlation between positively charged kaons and deuterons measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at the LHC with the ALICE experiment is employed to determine the upper limit for the time delay of the deuteron emission with respect to all other hadrons. Two scenarios are considered: the first assumes that deuterons form following the decays of short-lived strong resonances, while the second assumes that deuteron production occurs simultaneously with all other primary hadrons. For both scenarios, an additional delay time can be introduced using the CECA source model and its upper limit can be extracted by fitting the femtoscopy correlation. Two models are considered for the strong K$^+$d final state interaction. For the scenario where deuterons production is affected by baryonic resonances the upper limit of the time delay is 2.25 fm/c, while for the primary production scenario the upper limit is 4.75 fm/c. These results support the hypothesis of an early formation of the deuteron as an extended, weakly bound composite object in ultra-relativistic proton-proton collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Zephyr quantum-assisted hierarchical Calo4pQVAE for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the approach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era set to begin particle collisions by the end of this decade, it is evident that the computational demands of traditional collision simulation methods are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Existing approaches, which rely heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for modeling event showers in calorimeters, are projected to require millions of CPU-years annually -- far exceeding current computational capacities. This bottleneck presents an exciting opportunity for advancements in computational physics by integrating deep generative models with quantum simulations. We propose a quantum-assisted hierarchical deep generative surrogate founded on a variational autoencoder (VAE) in combination with an energy conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in the model's latent space as a prior. By mapping the topology of D-Wave's Zephyr quantum annealer (QA) into the nodes and couplings of a 4-partite RBM, we leverage quantum simulation to accelerate our shower generation times significantly. To evaluate our framework, we use Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge 2022. Through the integration of classical computation and quantum simulation, this hybrid framework paves way for utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models.</description>

      <title>Photon vortex generation from nonlinear Compton scattering in Feynman approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we show calculation of nonlinear Compton scattering with circularly polarized photons in a cylindrical coordinate using Feynman diagram to calculate photon vortex generation in intermediate states considering conservation of angular momentum. We take two different vortex wave functions based on Bessel function for the emitted photon and the electron after emission of the photon, which are the eigenstate of z component of the total angular momentum (zTAM) when a particle propagates along z axis. The result shows that when an electron absorbs N photons a photon vortex with a zTAM = N is predominantly radiated, but there are still very small contributions of photons with a zTAM = (N-1) and (N +1) due to the spin flip of the initial electron. This means even when an electron absorbs only a single photon, the electron may emit a photon vortex of a zTAM of 2 h-bar. However, the numerical calculations show that the contribution of the spin flip is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the dominant radiation. We also discuss the circular polarization for the generated photon vortices.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with event horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <title>PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Excited cluster states: A new source for proton number fluctuations in the high baryon density regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of the decay products of excited nuclear cluster states to the event-by-event fluctuations of protons in the energy range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2-5$~GeV within the statistical model. We find that the inclusion of the excited nuclear clusters yields corrections to all cumulant ratios, ranging from 1\% for ratio of second to first-order cumulant to 100\% for the sixth to second order cumulant towards the lowest inspected energy. As expected the contribution of excited cluster states is most important at low energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}&lt;3.5$~GeV and becomes negligible at higher collision energies. Especially in light of the expected ultra-high precision data from CBM at FAIR, this new contribution is important to allow for a quantitative comparison with (potentially later available) lattice QCD or effective model results.</description>

Abstract: Some calculations of parton distributions from first principles only give access to a limited range of Fourier modes of the function to reconstruct. We present a physically motivated procedure to regularize the inverse integral problem using a Gaussian process as a Bayesian prior. We propose to fix the hyperparameters of the prior in a meaningful physical fashion, offering a simple implementation, great numerical efficiency, and allowing us to understand and keep control easily of the uncertainty of the reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged current interactions of neutrinos inside the Earth can result in secondary muons and $\tau$-leptons which are detectable by several existing and planned neutrino experiments through a wide variety of event topologies. Consideration of such events can improve detector performance and provide unique signatures which help with event reconstruction. In this work, we describe NuLeptonSim, a propagation tool for neutrinos and charged leptons that builds on the fast NuTauSim framework. NuLeptonSim considers energy losses of charged leptons, modelled both continuously for performance or stochastically for accuracy, as well as interaction models for all flavors of neutrinos, including the Glashow resonance. We demonstrate the results from including these effects on the Earth emergence probability of various charged leptons from different flavors of primary neutrino and their corresponding energy distributions. We find that the emergence probability of muons can be higher than that of taus for energies below 100 PeV, whether from a primary muon or $\tau$ neutrino, and that the Glashow resonance contributes to a surplus of emerging leptons near the resonant energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the CDF measurement and the Standard Model theoretical prediction for the $W$-boson mass underscores the importance of conducting high-precision studies on the $W$ boson, which is one of the predominant objectives of proposed future $e^+e^-$ colliders. We investigate in detail the production of $W$-boson pairs at $e^+e^-$ colliders, and compute the next-to-next-to-leading order mixed QCD-EW corrections to both the integrated cross section and various kinematic distributions. By employing the method of differential equations, we analytically calculate the two-loop master integrals for the mixed QCD-EW virtual corrections to $e^+e^- \rightarrow W^+W^-$. Utilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a set of canonical master integrals for each integral family. This canonical basis satisfies a system of differential equations in which the dependence on the dimensional regulator is linearly factorized from the kinematics. We then express all these canonical master integrals as Taylor series in $\epsilon$ up to $\epsilon^4$, with coefficients articulated in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of these master integrals to the phenomenological analysis of $W$-pair production, we observe that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$ corrections are significantly impactful in the $\alpha(0)$ scheme, particularly in certain phase-space regions. However, these mixed QCD-EW corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $G_{\mu}$ scheme.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we analyze the spectral function of charmonium and bottomonium in the spinning black hole background and examine how the angular momentum affects the dissociation of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. From the results, we find that the angular momentum and temperature decreases the peak height and expands the peak width of the spectral function, thereby enhancing the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the angular momentum has a stronger dissociation effect in the transverse orientation, revealing the directional influence of angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamics of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we investigate the effect of angular momentum on the interquark distance, free energy, binding energy, entropy, entropic force, and internal energy of heavy quarkonium from the thermodynamic relationship. Our findings indicate that the angular momentum reduces the maximum value of interquark distance, suggesting that it promotes the dissociation of quarkonium. Additionally, we observe that the angular momentum suppresses free energy. From the results of binding energy, the angular momentum favors the melting of meson into a free quark and antiquark. Moreover, the results show that angular momentum increases the entropy and entropic force, thus accelerates the dissociation of quarkonium. The angular momentum increases the internal energy at large interquark distance. Finally, we find that the angular momentum has a more pronounced effect on quarkonium when the axis of quark pair $Q\overline{Q}$ is transverse to the direction of angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: The charm ($D$) and charm-strange ($D_s$) mesons are investigated in a variational scheme using Gaussian trial wave functions. The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance $r$, radial quantum number $n$, orbital quantum number $l$ and a trial parameter $\mu$. These wave functions are used to compute the expectation of Song and Lin potential dependent on $r$. The total energy (expectation of Hamiltonian) for each state is minimized with a parameter $\mu$ from the wavefunctions. The obtained spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the ($J$, $M^2$) and ($n_r$, $M^2$) planes. In ($J$, $M^2$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of $D$ and $D_s$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states. We have assigned the spin-parity to newly observed $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ as the strange partner of $D^*_2(2460)$ identified as $1^3P_2$, $D_1^*(2760)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ as $1^3D_1$, $D^*_3(2750)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)$ as $1^3D_3$, $D_2(2740)$ as $1D_2$, $D_0(2550)$ as $2^1S_0$, $D^*_1(2660)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2700)$ as $2^3S_1$, $D^*_J(3000)$ as $2^3P_0$ $D_J(3000)$ as $2P_1$, $D^*_2(3000)$ as $1^3F_2$ states.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of charm mixing parameters and determination of the CKM angle $\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated global analysis of beauty decays sensitive to the angle $\gamma$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and of $D$-meson mixing data in the framework of approximate universality for charm mixing. We extract the fundamental theoretical parameters determining absorptive and dispersive contributions to $D$ meson mixing and CP violation, together with the angle $\gamma$. The results for the charm mixing parameters are $x_{12} \simeq x = (0.402 \pm 0.044)\%$ and $y_{12} \simeq y = (0.627 \pm 0.021)\%$, while the two CP-violating phases are given by $\varphi_2^M = (1.9 \pm 1.6)^{\circ}$ and $\varphi_2^{\Gamma} = (2.7 \pm 1.6)^{\circ}$. The angle $\gamma$ is found to be $\gamma = (66.0 \pm 2.5)^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Rejection Sampling with Autodifferentiation - Case study: Fitting a Hadronization Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an autodifferentiable rejection sampling algorithm termed Rejection Sampling with Autodifferentiation (RSA). In conjunction with reweighting, we show that RSA can be used for efficient parameter estimation and model exploration. Additionally, this approach facilitates the use of unbinned machine-learning-based observables, allowing for more precise, data-driven fits. To showcase these capabilities, we apply an RSA-based parameter fit to a simplified hadronization model.</description>

      <title>Heavy-light mesons from a flavour-dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new symmetry-preserving framework for the physics of heavy-light mesons, whose key element is the effective incorporation of flavour-dependent contributions into the corresponding bound-state and quark gap equations. These terms originate from the fully-dressed quark-gluon vertices appearing in the kernels of these equations, and provide a natural distinction between ``light" and ``heavy" quarks. In this approach, only the classical form factor of the quark-gluon vertex is retained, and is evaluated in the so-called ``symmetric" configuration. The standard Slavnov-Taylor identity links this form factor to the quark wave-function, allowing for the continuous transition from light to heavy quarks through the mere variation of the current quark mass in the gap equation. The method is used to compute the masses and decay constants of specific pseudoscalars and vector heavy-light systems, showing good overall agreement with both experimental data and lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the form factors of $B_c\rightarrow D^{(*)}$, $D_{s}^{(*)}$ and their nonleptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to calculating the form factors of $B_c \to D^{*}$, $B_c \to D$, $B_c \to D_s^{*}$ and $B_c \to D_s$ transitions in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. At the QCD side, the contributions of $\langle\overline{q}q\rangle$, $\langle\overline{q}g_{s}\sigma Gq\rangle$, $\langle g_{s}^{2}G^{2}\rangle$, $\langle f^{3}G^{3}\rangle$ and $\langle\overline{q}q\rangle \langle g_{s}^{2}G^{2}\rangle$ are taken into account. With the obtained form factors, the decay widths and branching ratios of several two-body nonleptonic decay processes $B_c \to \eta_c D^{*}$, $\eta_c D$, $ J/\psi D^{*}$, $ J/\psi D$, $\eta_c D_s^{*}$, $\eta_c D_s$, $J/\psi D_s^{*}$ and $J/\psi D_s$ are predicted. These results about the form factors and decay properties of $B_c$ meson provide useful information for us to study the heavy-quark dynamics.</description>

      <title>Excited $\Omega$ hyperon in charmful $\Omega_b$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sextet $b$-baryon decay processes $\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega^{(*)}$, where $\Omega^*$ represents the $1P$-, $1D$- and $2S$-wave excited $\Omega$ hyperons in the spectroscopy. Using the constituent quark model, we obtain ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega)=2.1\times 10^{-4}$, which agrees with the previous studies to the order of magnitude. By identifying $\Omega(2012)$ as $\Omega(1^2P_{3/2^-})$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega(2012))=2.7\times 10^{-4}$ can be similarly significant. Additionally, $\Omega(1^2D_{5/2^+})$ and $\Omega(1^4D_{3/2^+},1^4D_{5/2^+})$ states exhibit production rates of 0.6, and (0.7, 1.0), respectively, relative to their ground-state counterpart. Notably, our findings suggest that ${\cal B}(\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+},2^4S_{3/2^+}))$ are as large as $(1.2,5.1)\times 10^{-4}$, making them accessible to experiments at LHCb.</description>

      <title>Fast Likelihood-free Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (${\it blind}$ reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (${\it template}$ reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools are integrated into the package ${\tt GWBackFinder}$, which is publicly available in https://github.com/AndronikiDimitriou/GWBackFinder.</description>

      <title>PandaX-xT: a Multi-ten-tonne Liquid Xenon Observatory at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a major upgrade to the existing PandaX-4T experiment in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The new experiment, PandaX-xT, will be a multi-ten-tonne liquid xenon, ultra-low background, and general-purpose observatory. The full-scaled PandaX-xT contains a 43-tonne liquid xenon active target. Such an experiment will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of particle physics and astrophysics. The sensitivity of dark matter direct detection will be improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to the current best limits, approaching the so-called "neutrino floor" for a dark matter mass above 10 GeV/$c^2$, providing a decisive test to the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle paradigm. By searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe isotope in the detector, the effective Majorana neutrino mass can be measured to a [10 -- 41] meV/$c^2$ sensitivity, providing a key test to the Dirac/Majorana nature of neutrino s. Astrophysical neutrinos and other ultra-rare interactions can also be measured and searched for with an unprecedented background level, opening up new windows of discovery. Depending on the findings, PandaX-xT will seek the next stage upgrade utilizing isotopic separation on natural xenon.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nuclear Shape Phase Transition in Ultra-Relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shape phase transition for certain isotope or isotone chains, associated with the quantum phase transition of finite nuclei, is an intriguing phenomenon in nuclear physics. A notable case is the Xe isotope chain, where the structure transits from a $\gamma$-soft rotor to a spherical vibrator, with the second-order shape phase transition occurring in the vicinity of $^{128-130}$Xe. In this letter, we focus on investigating the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe associated with the second-order shape phase transition by constructing novel correlators for ultra-relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions. In particular, our iEBE-VISHNU model calculations show that the $v_2^2-[p_T]$ correlation $\rho_{2}$ and the mean transverse momentum fluctuation $\Gamma_{p_T}$, which were previously interpreted as the evidence for the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe, can also be well explained by the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe. We also propose two novel correlators $\rho_{4,2}$ and $\rho_{2,4}$, which carry non-trivial higher-order correlations and show unique capabilities to distinguish between the $\gamma$-soft and the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the LHC. The present study also provides a novel way to explore the second-order shape phase transition of finite nuclei with ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. I. Time-radial-symmetric metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering three phenomenological, regular tr (time-radial)-symmetric space-times (including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones), featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For all three metrics we find that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by potentially an order of magnitude or more, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is devoted to non-\textit{tr}-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>

      <title>Cheshire $\theta$ terms, Aharonov-Bohm effects, and axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss unusual $\theta$ terms that can appear in field theories that allow global vortices. These `Cheshire $\theta$ terms' induce Aharonov-Bohm effects for some particles that move around vortices. For example, a Cheshire $\theta$ term can appear in QCD coupled to an axion and induces Aharonov-Bohm effects for baryons and leptons moving around axion strings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>
