      <title>Wetting-Layer-Assisted Synthesis of Inverted CdSe/PbSe Quantum Dots and their Photophysical and Photo-Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructured quantum dots (QDs) based on narrow-gap PbSe and wide-gap CdSe have been studied with an eye on their prospective applications in near-infrared (NIR) light sources, photodetectors, and solar cells. The most common structural motif is a spherical QD comprising a PbSe core enclosed into a CdSe shell. However, the potential barrier created by the CdSe shell complicates extraction of band-edge charge carriers from the QD. Therefore, conventional PbSe/CdSe QDs are not suitable for applications in practical photoconversion devices. Here we report inverted CdSe/PbSe core/shell QDs that overcome this drawback. In these structures, both photocarriers (electron and hole) exhibit a significant degree of shell localization and are therefore free to move within the QD solid and be extracted into an external circuit. To create such QDs, we employ a novel synthetic method in which a thin, atomically controlled wetting layer is used to homogenize the surface of the CdSe core and thus promote directionally uniform growth of the PbSe shell. Unlike noninverted QDs, inverted core/shell structures exhibit highly efficient photocarrier transport, making them excellent candidates for applications in practical photoconversion including photovoltaics, photodetection, and photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. By using this classification, we theoretically model a double-junction transport device that shows enhanced interaction with NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Sliding Luttinger Liquid and Topological Flat Bands in Symmetry Mismatched Moir\'e Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze a class of Moir\'e models consisting of an active honeycomb monolayer such as graphene or a hexagonal transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) on top of a substrate, in which the K and K' valleys of the active layer are folded near each other by a suitably chosen substrate geometry. Generalizing the so-called ``coupled-valley'' model of Scheer et al. [1], we start from a microscopic tight-binding description, deriving a continuum model from Schreiffer-Wolff perturbation theory and obtaining an effective description of the low-energy momentum states in either valley as well as the explicit microscopic forms of the Moir\'e potentials. We then consider two explicit symmetry-mismatched Moir\'e geometries with a rectangular substrate, the first of which displays an emergent time-reversal symmetry as well as a broad parameter regime which displays quasi-1D physics characterized by the existence of a Sliding Luttinger Liquid phase. This model also has a nontrivial topological character, captured by the Berry curvature dipole. The second geometry displays an emergent $C_3$ rotational symmetry despite the rectangular substrate, reducing to a continuum model considered in Ref. [1] that was shown to display honeycomb and Kagome topological flat bands.</description>

      <title>InAs Nanowire-Based Twin Electrical Sensors enabling Simultaneous Gas Detection Measurements: Nanodevice Engineering, Testing and Signal Fluctuation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxially grown InAs NWs are relevant for electrical sensing applications due to Fermi level pinning at NW surface, thus very sensitive to surrounding environment. While a single NW growth batch consists of millions virtually identical replicas of the same NW, real samples display subtle differences in NW size, shape, structure which may affect the detection performance. Here, electrical gas detection is investigated the in two NW-based nominally identical or twin devices fabricated starting from the same NW growth batch. Two individual wurtzite InAs NWs are placed onto a fabrication substrate at 2 micrometers distance with 90 degrees relative orientation, each NW is electrically contacted, and the nanodevices are exposed to humidity and NO$_2$ flux diluted in synthetic air. Electrical signal versus time is measured simultaneously in each nanodevice, upon different gases and concentrations. Observed detection limit is 2 ppm for NO$_2$, 20% for relative humidity. Correlation analysis method is exploited by calculating auto- and cross-correlation functions for the experimental signal pairs, indicating lack of cross-correlation in the signal noise of the two nanodevices, suggesting that signal differences could be ascribed mainly to nonidealities of fabrication protocol and nanoscopic differences in the two nanostructures, rather than different environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Entropy spectroscopy of a bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Uniquely identifying quantum Hall phases in charge neutral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-neutral graphene in the quantum Hall regime is an example of a quantum Hall ferromagnet in a complex spin-valley space. This system exhibits a plethora of phases, with the particular spin-valley order parameters chosen by the system depending sensitively on the short-range anisotropic couplings, the Zeeman field, and the sublattice symmetry breaking field. A subset of order parameters related to lattice symmetry-breaking have been observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, other order parameters, particularly those which superpose spin and valley, are more elusive, making it difficult to pin down the nature of the phase. We propose a solution this problem by examining two types of experimentally measurable quantities; transport gaps and collective mode dispersions. We find that the variation of the transport gap with the Zeeman and sublattice symmetry breaking fields, in conjunction with the number of Larmor and gapless modes, provides a unique signature for each theoretically possible phase.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Here, we report the experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current polarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the magnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the altermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a conventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing luxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with unconventional spin degeneracy lifting.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Nonlinear Absorption of a Strong Electromagnetic Wave in Infinite Semi-parabolic plus Semi-inverse Squared Quantum Wells by Using Quantum Kinetic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General analytic expressions for the total absorption coefficient of strong electromagnetic waves caused by confined electrons in Infinite semi-parabolic plus Semi-inverse Squared Quantum Wells (ISPSISQW) are obtained by using the quantum kinetic equation for electrons in the case of electron-optical phonon scattering. A second-order multi-photon process is included in the result. The dependence of the total absorption coefficient on the intensity $E_0$, the photon energy $\hbar \Omega$ of an SEMW, and the temperature T for a specific GaAs/GaAsAl ISPPSISQW is achieved by using a numerical method. The computational results demonstrate that the total absorption coefficient's dependence on photon energy can be utilized for optically detecting the electric sub-bands in an ISPPSISQW. Besides, we also give theoretical rules on the dependence of the Full Width at Half Maximum on important external parameters such as temperature and perpendicular magnetic field. Furthermore, the obtained results are consistent with prior theoretical and experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Temperature crossovers in the specific heat of amorphous magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is argued that the specific heat of amorphous solids at low temperatures can be understood to arise from a single branch of collective modes. The idea is illustrated in a model of a correlated spin glass for which magnetic anisotropies are present but they are completely frustrated by disorder. The low-energy spectrum is dominated by soft modes corresponding to propagating Halperin-Saslow spin waves at short wavelengths, evolving into a relaxation and a diffuson mode at the long wavelengths. The latter gives rise to an anomalous temperature behavior of the specific heat at $T\ll T_{*}$: $C\sim T$ in $d=3$ solids, $C\sim T\ln(1/T)$ in $d=2$. The temperature scale $T_{*}$ has a non-trivial dependence on the damping coefficient describing magnetic friction, which can be related to fluctuations of the spin-torque operator via a Green-Kubo formula. Halperin-Saslow modes can also become diffusive due to disclination motion (plastic flow). Extensions of these ideas to other systems (including disordered phases of correlated electrons in cuprate superconductors and of moir\'e superlattices) are discussed</description>

      <title>Actuation and mapping of SAW-induced high-frequency wavefields on suspended graphene membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High frequency acoustic devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials are unique platforms to design and manipulate the spatiotemporal response of acoustic waves for next-generation sensing and contactless actuation applications. Conventional methods for actuating suspended membranes, however, cannot be applied to all 2D materials, or are limited in frequency. There is, therefore, a need for a universal high-frequency, on-chip actuation technique that can be applied to all types of membranes. Here, we demonstrate that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be used to efficiently actuate suspended 2D materials by exciting suspended graphene membranes with high-frequency (375 MHz) Rayleigh surface waves and mapping the resulting vibration field with atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM). Acoustic waves travelling from supported to suspended graphene experience a reduction in acoustic wavelength from 10 \mu m to ~2 \mu um due to the decrease in effective bending rigidity, leading to a decrease in wave velocity on suspended graphene. By varying the excitation frequency, we observed a change in phase velocity from ~160 m/s to ~700 m/s. This behavior is consistent with the nonlinear dispersion of acoustic waves, as predicted by plate theory, in suspended graphene membranes. The geometry and bending rigidity of the membrane thus play key roles in modulating the acoustic wave pattern and wavelength. This combined SAW actuation and AFAM visualization scheme can give new insights into the fundamentals of acoustic transport at the nanoscale limit and provides a route towards the manipulation of localized wavefields for on-chip patterning and transport over 2D materials surfaces.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>

      <title>Achieving low contact resistance through copper-intercalated bilayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high contact resistance between MoS$_2$ and metals hinders its potential as an ideal solution for overcoming the short channel effect in silicon-based FETs at sub-3nm scales. We theoretically designed a MoS$_2$-based transistor, featuring bilayer MoS$_2$ connected to Cu-intercalated bilayer MoS$_2$ electrodes. At 0.6 V, contact resistance is 16.7 $\Omega \cdot \mu$m (zigzag) and 30.0 $\Omega \cdot \mu$m (armchair), nearing or even surpassing the 30 $\Omega \cdot \mu$m quantum limit for single-layer materials. This low resistance is attributed to the elimination of the tunneling barrier and the creation of ohmic contacts. Additionally, the small contact potential difference enables lower operating voltages. Our intercalation design offers a novel approach to achieving low contact resistance in 2D electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dynamics and Electron Transport in Isolated Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect describes the ability of chiral molecules and crystals to transmit spin-polarized currents, a phenomenon first identified in 1999. Although this effect holds great promise for a broad spectrum of different applications (including, $\textit{e.g.}$, spintronics, quantum computing, spin- and enantio-selective chemistry) in spintronics and electron transfer processes, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The prevailing hypothesis attributes the CISS effect to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within chiral molecules. However, the SOC magnitude required to align with experimental observations significantly exceeds the values derived from conventional atomic-scale calculations, particularly for systems composed of light atoms. In this work, we leverage the implementation of fully relativistic density functional theory (DFT) equation, as available in the Dirac code, to investigate how molecular chirality manifest itself in the chirality density of the outermost electron density. We further explore how this responds to an applied external electric field. To assess spin-dependent transport, we employ the Landauer-Imry-B\"uttiker formalism, examining the dependence of spin transmission on the twist angle of the molecular structure that defines its geometrical chirality. While our findings qualitatively align with experimental trends, they point to the necessity of a more general treatment of SOC, $\textit{e.g.}$, including geometrical terms or through the dependence of advanced exchange-correlation functionals on the electronic spin-current density.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fano physics behind the N-resonance in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states and scattering resonances in the unoccupied continuum of a two-dimensional crystal predicted in [Phys.Rev. B 87, 041405(R) (2013)] are considered within an exactly solvable model. A close connection of the observed resonances with those arising in the Fano theory is revealed. The resonance occurs when the lateral scattering couples the layer-perpendicular incident electron wave to a strictly bound state. The coupling strength determines the location of the pole in the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane, which is analytically shown to lead to a characteristic Fano-lineshape of the energy dependence of the electron transmissivity through the crystal. The implications for the timing of the resonance scattering are discussed. The analytical results are illustrated by ab initio calculations for a graphene monolayer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensive development of the field of spiking neural networks has led to many areas of research that have a direct impact on people's lives. As the most bio-similar of all neural networks, spiking neural networks not only allow the solution of recognition and clustering problems (including dynamics), but also contribute to the growing knowledge of the human nervous system. Our analysis has shown that the hardware implementation is of great importance, since the specifics of the physical processes in the network cells affect their ability to simulate the neural activity of living neural tissue, the efficiency of certain stages of information processing, storage and transmission. This survey reviews existing hardware neuromorphic implementations of bio-inspired spiking networks in the "semiconductor", "superconductor" and "optical" domains. Special attention is given to the possibility of effective "hybrids" of different approaches</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Quantum Magnetic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong starting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general overview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretation of large Lorentz violation via Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical intepretation of effective field theories of fundamental interactions incorporating large Lorentz violation is a long-standing challenge, known as the concordance problem. In condensed-matter physics, certain Weyl semimetals with emergent Lorentz invariance exhibit large Lorentz violation, thereby offering prospective laboratory analogues for exploration of this issue. We take advantage of the mathematical equivalence between the descriptions of large Lorentz violation in fundamental and condensed-matter physics to investigate the primary aspects of the concordance problem, which arise when the coefficients for Lorentz violation are large or the observer frame is highly boosted. Using thermodynamic arguments, we present a physical solution to the concordance problem and explore some implications.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing exotic quantum phases of matter, e.g. spin liquid, is an attractive topic in condensed matter. Here, by a Monte Carlo study of a two-orbital spin-fermion model on a honeycomb lattice, we show the cooperative effects of the orbital degeneracy of itinerant electrons and the exchange interaction of localized spins can significantly suppress both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders by generating topological defects and give rise to an intermediate spin liquid state via continuous phase transitions. This phase competition can also be achieved by tuning the electron filling. These results shed new light on realizing spin liquids on geometrically non-frustrated lattices.</description>

      <title>Automated Materials Discovery Platform Realized: Scanning Probe Microscopy of Combinatorial Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial libraries are a powerful approach for exploring the evolution of physical properties across binary and ternary cross-sections in multicomponent phase diagrams. Although the synthesis of these libraries has been developed since the 1960s and expedited with advanced laboratory automation, the broader application of combinatorial libraries relies on fast, reliable measurements of concentration-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer significant potential for quantitative, functionally relevant combi-library readouts. Here we demonstrate the implementation of fully automated SPM to explore the evolution of ferroelectric properties in combinatorial libraries, focusing on Sm-doped BiFeO3 and ZnxMg1-xO systems. We also present and compare Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization models for fully automated exploration, emphasizing local reproducibility (effective noise) as an essential factor in optimal experiment workflows. Automated SPM, when coupled with upstream synthesis controls, plays a pivotal role in bridging materials synthesis and characterization.</description>

      <title>Elastic Constants and Bending Rigidities from Long-Wavelength Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical and elastic properties of materials are among the most fundamental quantities for many engineering and industrial applications. Here, we present a formulation that is efficient and accurate for calculating the elastic and bending rigidity tensors of crystalline solids, leveraging interatomic force constants and long-wavelength perturbation theory. Crucially, in the long-wavelength limit, lattice vibrations induce macroscopic electric fields which further couple with the propagation of elastic waves, and a separate treatment on the long-range electrostatic interactions is thereby required to obtain elastic properties under the appropriate electrical boundary conditions. A cluster expansion of the charge density response and dielectric screening function in the long-wavelength limit has been developed to efficiently extract multipole and dielectric tensors of arbitrarily high order. We implement the proposed method in a first-principles framework and perform extensive validations on silicon, NaCl, GaAs and rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ as well as monolayer graphene, hexagonal BN, MoS$_2$ and InSe, obtaining good to excellent agreement with other theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Notably, we establish that multipolar interactions up to at least octupoles are necessary to obtain the accurate short-circuit elastic tensor of bulk materials, while higher orders beyond octupole interactions are required to converge the bending rigidity tensor of 2D crystals. The present approach greatly simplifies the calculations of bending rigidities and will enable the automated characterization of the mechanical properties of novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Quantized Conductance by Accelerated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional quantized conductance is derived from the electrons in a homogeneous electric field by calculating the traveling time of the accelerated motion and the number of electrons in the one-dimensional region. As a result, the quantized conductance is attributed to the finite time required for ballistic electrons to travel a finite length. In addition, even if the conductance is finite, it is possible to say that this model requires no Joule heat dissipation, because the electrical power is converted to kinetic energy of electrons. Furthermore, the relationship between the non-equilibrium source-drain bias $V_\mathrm{sd}$ and the wavenumber $k$ in a one-dimensional conductor is shown as $k \propto \sqrt{V_\mathrm{sd}}$. This correspondence explains the wavelength of the coherent electron flows emitted from a quantum point contact. It also explains the anomalous $0.7 \cdot 2e^2/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, and $h$ is the Plank's constant) conductance plateau as a consequence of the perturbation gap at the crossing point of the wavenumber-direction-splitting dispersion relation. We propose that this splitting is caused by the Rashba spin-orbit interaction induced by the potential gradient of the quantum well at quantum point contacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, based on the quantum kinetic equation approach, we systematically present the radio-electric effect in asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells under the influence of a laser radiation field taking into account the electron-longitudinal optical phonon scattering mechanism. The numerical results show that the blue-shift of the maximum peaks in the photon energy range is less than 60 meV. The height of maximum peaks increases according to an exponential rule, depending nonlinearly on the structural parameters of the asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells. In the photon energy range greater than 100 meV, the saturated radio-electric field increases with temperature and geometric parameters of the quantum well. The results show the differences between symmetric and asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells, highlighting the influence of asymmetric structures on radio-electric effects in two-dimensional quantum well systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) at the interface of a bilayer system of a ferromagnetic insulator and graphene. We compare the tunneling spin current at the interface because of the SSE and the spin pumping (SP), where the SSE and SP are induced by the temperature gradient and the microwave irradiation, respectively. We demonstrate that the thermally driven SSE exhibits a quantum oscillation pattern similar to that predicted in coherently driven SP. Additionally, we show a peak shift of the quantum oscillation owing to the contribution of thermally excited magnons with higher frequencies, which becomes particularly pronounced at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Correlated states in super-moir\'e materials with a kernel polynomial quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-moir\'e materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moir\'e materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moir\'e materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moir\'e materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross interpolation matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moir\'e structure to a many-body Hilbert space, that is efficiently sampled with tensor cross interpolation with matrix product states, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moir\'e systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moir\'e-of-moir\'e systems and domain walls between different moir\'e systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moir\'e phenomena.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <title>Steering spin fluctuations in lattice systems via two-tone Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the control of spin pair fluctuations using two-tone Floquet engineering. We consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice with periodically modulated spin exchanges using parametric resonances. The stroboscopic dynamics generated from distributed spin exchange modulations lead to spin pair fluctuations reaching quasi-maximally correlated states and a subharmonic response in local observables, breaking the discrete-time translational symmetry. We present a protocol to control the interacting many-body dynamics, producing spatial and temporal localization of correlated spin pairs via dynamically breaking correlated spin pairs from the edges towards the center of the lattice. Our result reveals how spin fluctuations distribute in a heterogeneous lattice depending on parametric resonances. This may open new routes for exploring distinct nonequilibrium states of matter and the conduction of quasiparticles in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Binding zero modes with fluxons in Josephson junctions of time-reversal invariant topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of the phase bias $\phi$ and the propagating Majorana fermions of the edge modes in Josephson junctions containing 2D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We consider TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions, as well as junctions between topological and non-topological superconductors (TRITOPS-S). Both types of junctions are described by effective Dirac Hamiltonians with a $\phi$-dependent mass. We analyze the effect of the phase fluctuations in the junction, as well as solitonic solutions of $\phi$ generated by fluxons trapped in the junction. We show that these solitons generate a spatial-dependent mass with a sign change akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi model. This enables the formation of zero-energy fermionic states localized at the fluxon. For the TRITOPS-TRITOPS junction these consist of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes, while for the TRITOPS-S one, there is a single Majorana fermion. The localized bound states hybridize in soliton-antisoliton configurations. Depending on the occupation state, these modes generate an effective attraction or repulsion in the dynamics of the soliton-antisoliton collision.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>
