      <title>Tempo: Helping Data Scientists and Domain Experts Collaboratively Specify Predictive Modeling Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal predictive models have the potential to improve decisions in health care, public services, and other domains, yet they often fail to effectively support decision-makers. Prior literature shows that many misalignments between model behavior and decision-makers' expectations stem from issues of model specification, namely how, when, and for whom predictions are made. However, model specifications for predictive tasks are highly technical and difficult for non-data-scientist stakeholders to interpret and critique. To address this challenge we developed Tempo, an interactive system that helps data scientists and domain experts collaboratively iterate on model specifications. Using Tempo's simple yet precise temporal query language, data scientists can quickly prototype specifications with greater transparency about pre-processing choices. Moreover, domain experts can assess performance within data subgroups to validate that models behave as expected. Through three case studies, we demonstrate how Tempo helps multidisciplinary teams quickly prune infeasible specifications and identify more promising directions to explore.</description>

      <title>Divisi: Interactive Search and Visualization for Scalable Exploratory Subgroup Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing data subgroups is a common data science task to build intuition about a dataset and identify areas to improve model performance. However, subgroup analysis is prohibitively difficult in datasets with many features, and existing tools limit unexpected discoveries by relying on user-defined or static subgroups. We propose exploratory subgroup analysis as a set of tasks in which practitioners discover, evaluate, and curate interesting subgroups to build understanding about datasets and models. To support these tasks we introduce Divisi, an interactive notebook-based tool underpinned by a fast approximate subgroup discovery algorithm. Divisi's interface allows data scientists to interactively re-rank and refine subgroups and to visualize their overlap and coverage in the novel Subgroup Map. Through a think-aloud study with 13 practitioners, we find that Divisi can help uncover surprising patterns in data features and their interactions, and that it encourages more thorough exploration of subtypes in complex data.</description>

      <title>Static Algorithm, Evolving Epidemic: Understanding the Potential of Human-AI Risk Assessment to Support Regional Overdose Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug overdose deaths, including those due to prescription opioids, represent a critical public health issue in the United States and worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been developed and deployed to help prescribers assess a patient's risk for overdose-related death, but it is unknown whether public health experts can leverage similar predictions to make local resource allocation decisions more effectively. In this work, we evaluated how AI-based overdose risk assessment could be used to inform local public health decisions using a working prototype system. Experts from three health departments, of varying locations and sizes with respect to staff and population served, were receptive to the potential benefits of algorithmic risk prediction and of using AI-augmented visualization to connect across data sources. However, they also expressed concerns about whether the risk prediction model's formulation and underlying data would match the state of the overdose epidemic as it evolved in their specific locations. Our findings extend those of other studies on algorithmic systems in the public sector, and they present opportunities for future human-AI collaborative tools to support decision-making in local, time-varying contexts.</description>

      <title>VisiMark: Characterizing and Augmenting Landmarks for People with Low Vision in Augmented Reality to Support Indoor Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landmarks are critical in navigation, supporting self-orientation and mental model development. Similar to sighted people, people with low vision (PLV) frequently look for landmarks via visual cues but face difficulties identifying some important landmarks due to vision loss. We first conducted a formative study with six PLV to characterize their challenges and strategies in landmark selection, identifying their unique landmark categories (e.g., area silhouettes, accessibility-related objects) and preferred landmark augmentations. We then designed VisiMark, an AR interface that supports landmark perception for PLV by providing both overviews of space structures and in-situ landmark augmentations. We evaluated VisiMark with 16 PLV and found that VisiMark enabled PLV to perceive landmarks they preferred but could not easily perceive before, and changed PLV's landmark selection from only visually-salient objects to cognitive landmarks that are more important and meaningful. We further derive design considerations for AR-based landmark augmentation systems for PLV.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Motion on 2D Gaze Estimation in Real-World Mobile Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking involves inferring a user's gaze point or direction on a mobile device's screen from facial images captured by the device's front camera. While this technology inspires an increasing number of gaze-interaction applications, achieving consistent accuracy remains challenging due to dynamic user-device spatial relationships and varied motion conditions inherent in mobile contexts. This paper provides empirical evidence on how user mobility and behaviour affect mobile gaze tracking accuracy. We conduct two user studies collecting behaviour and gaze data under various motion conditions - from lying to maze navigation - and during different interaction tasks. Quantitative analysis has revealed behavioural regularities among daily tasks and identified head distance, head pose, and device orientation as key factors affecting accuracy, with errors increasing by up to 48.91% in dynamic conditions compared to static ones. These findings highlight the need for more robust, adaptive eye-tracking systems that account for head movements and device deflection to maintain accuracy across diverse mobile contexts.</description>

      <title>PLAID: Supporting Computing Instructors to Identify Domain-Specific Programming Plans at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedagogical approaches focusing on stereotypical code solutions, known as programming plans, can increase problem-solving ability and motivate diverse learners. However, plan-focused pedagogies are rarely used beyond introductory programming. Our formative study (N=10 educators) showed that identifying plans is a tedious process. To advance plan-focused pedagogies in application-focused domains, we created an LLM-powered pipeline that automates the effortful parts of educators' plan identification process by providing use-case-driven program examples and candidate plans. In design workshops (N=7 educators), we identified design goals to maximize instructors' efficiency in plan identification by optimizing interaction with this LLM-generated content. Our resulting tool, PLAID, enables instructors to access a corpus of relevant programs to inspire plan identification, compare code snippets to assist plan refinement, and facilitates them in structuring code snippets into plans. We evaluated PLAID in a within-subjects user study (N=12 educators) and found that PLAID led to lower cognitive demand and increased productivity compared to the state-of-the-art. Educators found PLAID beneficial for generating instructional material. Thus, our findings suggest that human-in-the-loop approaches hold promise for supporting plan-focused pedagogies at scale.</description>

      <title>Script&amp;Shift: A Layered Interface Paradigm for Integrating Content Development and Rhetorical Strategy with LLM Writing Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Good writing is a dynamic process of knowledge transformation, where writers refine and evolve ideas through planning, translating, and reviewing. Generative AI-powered writing tools can enhance this process but may also disrupt the natural flow of writing, such as when using LLMs for complex tasks like restructuring content across different sections or creating smooth transitions. We introduce Script&amp;Shift, a layered interface paradigm designed to minimize these disruptions by aligning writing intents with LLM capabilities to support diverse content development and rhetorical strategies. By bridging envisioning, semantic, and articulatory distances, Script&amp;Shift's interactions allow writers to leverage LLMs for various content development tasks (scripting) and experiment with diverse organization strategies while tailoring their writing for different audiences (shifting). This approach preserves creative control while encouraging divergent and iterative writing. Our evaluation shows that Script&amp;Shift enables writers to creatively and efficiently incorporate LLMs while preserving a natural flow of composition.</description>

      <title>GenComUI: Exploring Generative Visual Aids as Medium to Support Task-Oriented Human-Robot Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the integration of generative visual aids in human-robot task communication. We developed GenComUI, a system powered by large language models that dynamically generates contextual visual aids (such as map annotations, path indicators, and animations) to support verbal task communication and facilitate the generation of customized task programs for the robot. This system was informed by a formative study that examined how humans use external visual tools to assist verbal communication in spatial tasks. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a user experiment (n = 20) comparing GenComUI with a voice-only baseline. The results demonstrate that generative visual aids, through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, enhance verbal task communication by providing continuous visual feedback, thus promoting natural and effective human-robot communication. Additionally, the study offers a set of design implications, emphasizing how dynamically generated visual aids can serve as an effective communication medium in human-robot interaction. These findings underscore the potential of generative visual aids to inform the design of more intuitive and effective human-robot communication, particularly for complex communication scenarios in human-robot interaction and LLM-based end-user development.</description>

      <title>SpeechCap: Leveraging Playful Impact Captions to Facilitate Interpersonal Communication in Social Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a promising platform bringing immersive, interactive, and engaging mechanisms for collaborative activities in virtual spaces. However, interpersonal communication in social VR is still limited with existing mediums and channels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method for mediating real-time conversation in social VR, which uses impact captions, a type of typographic visual effect widely used in videos, to convey both verbal and non-verbal information. We first investigated the design space of impact captions by content analysis and a co-design session with four experts. Next, we implemented SpeechCap as a proof-of-concept system, with which users can communicate with each other using speech-driven impact captions in VR. Through a user study (n=14), we evaluated the effectiveness of the visual and interaction design of impact captions, highlighting the interactivity and the integration of verbal and non-verbal information in communication mediums. Finally, we discussed topics of visual rhetoric, interactivity, and ambiguity as the main findings from the study, and further provided design implications for future work for facilitating interpersonal communication in social VR.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Privacy Dynamics within Groups using Gamified Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online shared content, such as group pictures, often contains information about multiple users. Developing technical solutions to manage the privacy of such "co-owned" content is challenging because each co-owner may have different preferences. Recent technical approaches advocate group-decision mechanisms, including auctions, to decide as how best to resolve these differences. However, it is not clear if users would participate in such mechanisms and if they do, whether they would act altruistically. Understanding the privacy dynamics is crucial to develop effective mechanisms for privacy-respecting collaborative systems. Accordingly, this work develops RESOLVE, a privacy auction game to understand the sharing behavior of users in groups. Our results of users' playing the game show that i) the users' understanding of individual vs. group privacy differs significantly; ii) often users fight for their preferences even at the cost of others' privacy; and iii) at times users collaborate to fight for the privacy of others.</description>

      <title>SpellRing: Recognizing Continuous Fingerspelling in American Sign Language using a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerspelling is a critical part of American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and has become an accessible optional text entry method for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals. In this paper, we introduce SpellRing, a single smart ring worn on the thumb that recognizes words continuously fingerspelled in ASL. SpellRing uses active acoustic sensing (via a microphone and speaker) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to track handshape and movement, which are processed through a deep learning algorithm using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We evaluated the system with 20 ASL signers (13 fluent and 7 learners), using the MacKenzie-Soukoref Phrase Set of 1,164 words and 100 phrases. Offline evaluation yielded top-1 and top-5 word recognition accuracies of 82.45% (9.67%) and 92.42% (5.70%), respectively. In real-time, the system achieved a word error rate (WER) of 0.099 (0.039) on the phrases. Based on these results, we discuss key lessons and design implications for future minimally obtrusive ASL recognition wearables.</description>

      <title>Be Friendly, Not Friends: How LLM Sycophancy Shapes User Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agents often exhibit `sycophancy', a tendency to adapt their responses to align with user perspectives, even at the expense of factual accuracy. However, users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and its interplay with other anthropomorphic features (e.g., friendliness) in shaping user trust remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we conducted a 2 (Sycophancy: presence vs. absence) $\times$ 2 (Friendliness: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment ($N = 224$). Our study uncovered, for the first time, the intricate dynamics between LLM sycophancy and friendliness: When an LLM agent already exhibits a friendly demeanor, being sycophantic reduces perceived authenticity, thereby lowering user trust; Conversely, when the agent is less friendly, aligning its responses with user opinions makes it appear more genuine, leading to higher user trust. \add{Our findings entail profound implications for AI persuasion through exploiting human psychological tendencies and highlight the imperative for responsible designs in user-LLM agent interactions.</description>

      <title>CodeA11y: Making AI Coding Assistants Useful for Accessible Web Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in accessible computing is ensuring developers produce web UI code that supports assistive technologies. Despite numerous specialized accessibility tools, novice developers often remain unaware of them, leading to ~96% of web pages that contain accessibility violations. AI coding assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, could offer potential by generating accessibility-compliant code, but their impact remains uncertain. Our formative study with 16 developers without accessibility training revealed three key issues in AI-assisted coding: failure to prompt AI for accessibility, omitting crucial manual steps like replacing placeholder attributes, and the inability to verify compliance. To address these issues, we developed CodeA11y, a GitHub Copilot Extension, that suggests accessibility-compliant code and displays manual validation reminders. We evaluated it through a controlled study with another 20 novice developers. Our findings demonstrate its effectiveness in guiding novice developers by reinforcing accessibility practices throughout interactions, representing a significant step towards integrating accessibility into AI coding assistants.</description>

      <title>"AI Afterlives" as Digital Legacy: Perceptions, Expectations, and Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of generative AI technology has sparked interest in using digital information to create AI-generated agents as digital legacy. These agents, often referred to as "AI Afterlives", present unique challenges compared to traditional digital legacy. Yet, there is limited human-centered research on "AI Afterlife" as digital legacy, especially from the perspectives of the individuals being represented by these agents. This paper presents a qualitative study examining users' perceptions, expectations, and concerns regarding AI-generated agents as digital legacy. We identify factors shaping people's attitudes, their perceived differences compared with the traditional digital legacy, and concerns they might have in real practices. We also examine the design aspects throughout the life cycle and interaction process. Based on these findings, we situate "AI Afterlife" in digital legacy, and delve into design implications for maintaining identity consistency and balancing intrusiveness and support in "AI Afterlife" as digital legacy.</description>

Abstract: The growing use of wearable devices for activity tracking, healthcare, and haptics faces challenges due to the bulkiness and short lifespan of batteries. Integration of a textile-based wireless charging and readout system into everyday clothing can enable seamless power supply and data collection around the body. However, expanding such system to cover the entire body is challenging, as it increases electromagnetic interference with the body, degrading the performance of wireless system. This article introduces a meandered textile coil designed for body-scale, efficient wireless charging and readout. The meander coil can confine a strong inductive field near the body surface, ensuring W-class safe charging and sensitive readout with uW-class low power. Moreover, its zigzag design is simple enough for mass production on industrial knitting machines. Therefore, the body-scale meander coil can continuously operate battery-free wearable devices across the body, leading to ubiquitous deployment of continuous full-body wearable computing into everyday clothing.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing the perceived usability of mobile applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of mobile applications has brought new frontiers to usability studies. So far, the ongoing research has undertaken considerable efforts to model usability in such new challenging context. One of these endeavors is the PACMAD+3 model, which consists of a total of ten unique factors. However, to the best of our knowledge, little or no effort has been made to empirically evaluate these factors against perceived influence. With this in mind, the objective of this study is to explore this issue by evaluating the selected factors. To achieve this goal in a reliable and reproducible manner, we took advantage of previous attempts to conceptualize the mobile usability factors, but we contribute by operationalizing these theoretical constructs into observable and measurable phenomena. In this sense, the survey was designed and carried out on the sample of 838 users in order to evaluate the significance of the PACMAD+3 factors on the perceived usability of mobile applications. Our findings show that, on average, users rated efficiency as highly important, while the remaining seven, namely: cognitive load, errors, learnability, operability, effectiveness, memorability, and understandability, were rated as moderately important. The discussed results provide insight into the importance of usability attributes and quality criteria from both perspectives, ultimately facilitating and securing the design and development of mobile applications. Therefore, our research contributes to the field of human-computer interaction, with both theoretical and practical implications for mobile usability researchers, UX designers, and quality assurance engineers.</description>

      <title>Prompting in the Dark: Assessing Human Performance in Prompt Engineering for Data Labeling When Gold Labels Are Absent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but how good are people at prompt engineering? Do users actually get closer to their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure progress. This paper investigates a scenario in LLM-powered data labeling, "prompting in the dark," where users iteratively prompt LLMs to label data without using manually-labeled benchmarks. We developed PromptingSheet, a Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable-only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available. Our findings highlight the importance of gold labels and the needs, as well as the risks, of automated support in human prompt engineering, providing insights for future tool design.</description>

      <title>FairFare: A Tool for Crowdsourcing Rideshare Data to Empower Labor Organizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rideshare workers experience unpredictable working conditions due to gig work platforms' reliance on opaque AI and algorithmic systems. In response to these challenges, we found that labor organizers want data to help them advocate for legislation to increase the transparency and accountability of these platforms. To address this need, we collaborated with a Colorado-based rideshare union to develop FairFare, a tool that crowdsources and analyzes workers' data to estimate the take rate -- the percentage of the rider price retained by the rideshare platform. We deployed FairFare with our partner organization that collaborated with us in collecting data on 76,000+ trips from 45 drivers over 18 months. During evaluation interviews, organizers reported that FairFare helped influence the bill language and passage of Colorado Senate Bill 24-75, calling for greater transparency and data disclosure of platform operations, and create a national narrative. Finally, we reflect on complexities of translating quantitative data into policy outcomes, nature of community based audits, and design implications for future transparency tools.</description>

      <title>"When I lost it, they dragged me out": How Care Encounters Empower Marginalized Young Adults' Mental Health Care-Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CSCW research has long explored ways to enhance the well-being of marginalized populations. This study examines how young adults with diverse marginalized identities navigate their mental health care-seeking journeys through in-depth interviews and visual elicitation methods. Our research with 18 U.S. participants reveals predominantly \textit{passive} behavioral patterns shaped by participants' lived experiences of marginalization. A key finding centers on \textit{"care encounters"} - serendipitous interactions with mental health resources that occur when individuals are not actively seeking support. These encounters emerged as critical turning points, catalyzing shifts from passive to proactive care-seeking behaviors. The transformative impact of these encounters operated through three primary mechanisms: tangible assistance, supportive discourse, and social connection building. Our analysis illuminates the infrastructural conditions that enable such transformative encounters and their effectiveness in connecting marginalized young adults with mental health care. This research advances our understanding of how marginalization influences care-seeking behaviors while providing concrete design implications for socio-technical interventions. Our findings suggest strategies for intentionally engineering care encounters that can help overcome passive behavioral patterns and strengthen marginalized young adults' engagement with mental health resources.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Human and Machine Learning Errors in Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning applications in high-stakes scenarios should always operate under human oversight. Developing an optimal combination of human and machine intelligence requires an understanding of their complementarities, particularly regarding the similarities and differences in the way they make mistakes. We perform extensive experiments in the area of face recognition and compare two automated face recognition systems against human annotators through a demographically balanced user study. Our research uncovers important ways in which machine learning errors and human errors differ from each other, and suggests potential strategies in which human-machine collaboration can improve accuracy in face recognition.</description>

      <title>FontCraft: Multimodal Font Design Using Interactive Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating new fonts requires a lot of human effort and professional typographic knowledge. Despite the rapid advancements of automatic font generation models, existing methods require users to prepare pre-designed characters with target styles using font-editing software, which poses a problem for non-expert users. To address this limitation, we propose FontCraft, a system that enables font generation without relying on pre-designed characters. Our approach integrates the exploration of a font-style latent space with human-in-the-loop preferential Bayesian optimization and multimodal references, facilitating efficient exploration and enhancing user control. Moreover, FontCraft allows users to revisit previous designs, retracting their earlier choices in the preferential Bayesian optimization process. Once users finish editing the style of a selected character, they can propagate it to the remaining characters and further refine them as needed. The system then generates a complete outline font in OpenType format. We evaluated the effectiveness of FontCraft through a user study comparing it to a baseline interface. Results from both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FontCraft enables non-expert users to design fonts efficiently.</description>

      <title>"An Image of Ourselves in Our Minds": How College-educated Online Dating Users Construct Profiles for Effective Self Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online dating is frequently used by individuals looking for potential relationships and intimate connections. Central to dating apps is the creation and refinement of a dating profile, which represents the way individuals desire to present themselves to potential mates, while hiding information they do not care to share. To investigate the way frequent users of dating apps construct their online profiles and perceive the effectiveness of strategies taken in making profiles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users who are Chinese college-educated young adults and uncovered the processes and rationales by which they make profiles for online dating, particularly in selecting images for inclusion. We found that participants used idealized photos that exaggerated their positive personality traits, sometimes traits that they do not possess but perceive others to desire, and sometimes even traits they wish they had possessed. Users also strategically used photos that show personality and habits without showing themselves, and often hid certain identifying information to reduce privacy risks. This analysis signals potential factors that are key in building online dating profiles, providing design implications for systems that limit the use of inaccurate information while still promoting self-expression in relationship platforms.</description>

      <title>BIG-AOME: Designing Bodily Interaction Gamification towards Anti-sedentary Online Meeting Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online meetings have become an integral part of daily life, but prolonged screen time poses significant health risks. While various interventions address sedentary lifestyles, few focus on mitigating sedentary behavior during online meetings. Design opportunities in this context remain underexplored. This study investigates the design of gamified bodily interactions as anti-sedentary measures during online meetings using a research through design approach. In collaboration with 11 users, we co-designed and iterated three prototypes, resulting in the BIG-AOME (Bodily Interaction Gamification towards Anti-sedentary Online Meeting Environments) framework. User studies with 15 participants across three groups evaluated these prototypes through semi-structured interviews analyzed using Hsieh's qualitative content analysis. Findings show that gamified bodily interactions encourage physical movement while reducing awkwardness during online meetings. Participants valued the social engagement fostered by cooperative and competitive elements in these games, enhancing social dynamics while encouraging physical movement. Such games can also serve as online icebreakers or playful decision-making tools. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of design dimensions within the BIG-AOME framework, including body engagement, attention, bodily interplay, timeliness, and virtual/physical environments, highlighting the potential of anti-sedentary bodily interactions to mitigate sedentary behavior and enhance social connections in online meetings.</description>

      <title>Mind the GAP: Geometry Aware Passthrough Mitigates Cybersickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality headsets isolate users from the real-world by restricting their perception to the virtual-world. Video See-Through (VST) headsets address this by utilizing world-facing cameras to create Augmented Reality experiences. However, directly displaying camera feeds causes visual discomfort and cybersickness due to the inaccurate perception of scale and exaggerated motion parallax. This paper demonstrates the potential of geometry aware passthrough systems in mitigating cybersickness through accurate depth perception. We first present a methodology to benchmark and compare passthrough algorithms. Furthermore, we design a protocol to quantitatively measure cybersickness experienced by users in VST headsets. Using this protocol, we conduct a user study to compare direct passthrough and geometry aware passthrough systems. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to reveal significantly reduced nausea, disorientation, and total scores of cybersickness with geometry aware passthrough. It also uncovers several potential avenues to further mitigate visually-induced discomfort.</description>

      <title>Toward Metaphor-Fluid Conversation Design for Voice User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>RemoteChess: Enhancing Older Adults' Social Connectedness via Designing a Virtual Reality Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decline of social connectedness caused by distance and physical limitations severely affects older adults' well-being and mental health. While virtual reality (VR) is promising for older adults to socialize remotely, existing social VR designs primarily focus on verbal communication (e.g., reminiscent, chat). Actively engaging in shared activities is also an important aspect of social connection. We designed RemoteChess, which constructs a social community and a culturally relevant activity (i.e., Chinese chess) for older adults to play while engaging in social interaction. We conducted a user study with groups of older adults interacting with each other through RemoteChess. Our findings indicate that RemoteChess enhanced participants' social connectedness by offering familiar environments, culturally relevant social catalysts, and asymmetric interactions. We further discussed design guidelines for designing culturally relevant social activities in VR to promote social connectedness for older adults.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Brain-Computer Interface Interaction System Based on the Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11659v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Can you pass that tool?: Implications of Indirect Speech in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect speech acts (ISAs) are a natural pragmatic feature of human communication, allowing requests to be conveyed implicitly while maintaining subtlety and flexibility. Although advancements in speech recognition have enabled natural language interactions with robots through direct, explicit commands--providing clarity in communication--the rise of large language models presents the potential for robots to interpret ISAs. However, empirical evidence on the effects of ISAs on human-robot collaboration (HRC) remains limited. To address this, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=36), engaging a participant and a robot in collaborative physical tasks. Our findings indicate that robots capable of understanding ISAs significantly improve human's perceived robot anthropomorphism, team performance, and trust. However, the effectiveness of ISAs is task- and context-dependent, thus requiring careful use. These results highlight the importance of appropriately integrating direct and indirect requests in HRC to enhance collaborative experiences and task performance.</description>

      <title>From Text to Trust: Empowering AI-assisted Decision Making with Adaptive LLM-powered Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-assisted decision making becomes increasingly prevalent, yet individuals often fail to utilize AI-based decision aids appropriately especially when the AI explanations are absent, potentially as they do not %understand reflect on AI's decision recommendations critically. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional conversational and analytical capabilities, present great opportunities to enhance AI-assisted decision making in the absence of AI explanations by providing natural-language-based analysis of AI's decision recommendation, e.g., how each feature of a decision making task might contribute to the AI recommendation. In this paper, via a randomized experiment, we first show that presenting LLM-powered analysis of each task feature, either sequentially or concurrently, does not significantly improve people's AI-assisted decision performance. To enable decision makers to better leverage LLM-powered analysis, we then propose an algorithmic framework to characterize the effects of LLM-powered analysis on human decisions and dynamically decide which analysis to present. Our evaluation with human subjects shows that this approach effectively improves decision makers' appropriate reliance on AI in AI-assisted decision making.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Photorealism and Artifacts in Diffusion Model-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion model-generated images can appear indistinguishable from authentic photographs, but these images often contain artifacts and implausibilities that reveal their AI-generated provenance. Given the challenge to public trust in media posed by photorealistic AI-generated images, we conducted a large-scale experiment measuring human detection accuracy on 450 diffusion-model generated images and 149 real images. Based on collecting 749,828 observations and 34,675 comments from 50,444 participants, we find that scene complexity of an image, artifact types within an image, display time of an image, and human curation of AI-generated images all play significant roles in how accurately people distinguish real from AI-generated images. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy characterizing artifacts often appearing in images generated by diffusion models. Our empirical observations and taxonomy offer nuanced insights into the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models to generate photorealistic images in 2024.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Platform for Studying Learning with Intelligent Tutoring Systems: CTAT+TutorShop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are effective in helping students learn; further research could make them even more effective. Particularly desirable is research into how students learn with these systems, how these systems best support student learning, and what learning sciences principles are key in ITSs. CTAT+Tutorshop provides a full stack integrated platform that facilitates a complete research lifecycle with ITSs, which includes using ITS data to discover learner challenges, to identify opportunities for system improvements, and to conduct experimental studies. The platform includes authoring tools to support and accelerate development of ITS, which provide automatic data logging in a format compatible with DataShop, an independent site that supports the analysis of ed tech log data to study student learnings. Among the many technology platforms that exist to support learning sciences research, CTAT+Tutorshop may be the only one that offers researchers the possibility to author elements of ITSs, or whole ITSs, as part of designing studies. This platform has been used to develop and conduct an estimated 147 research studies which have run in a wide variety of laboratory and real-world educational settings, including K-12 and higher education, and have addressed a wide range of research questions. This paper presents five case studies of research conducted on the CTAT+Tutorshop platform, and summarizes what has been accomplished and what is possible for future researchers. We reflect on the distinctive elements of this platform that have made it so effective in facilitating a wide range of ITS research.</description>

      <title>You Can't Get There From Here: Redefining Information Science to address our sociotechnical futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current definitions of Information Science are inadequate to comprehensively describe the nature of its field of study and for addressing the problems that are arising from intelligent technologies. The ubiquitous rise of artificial intelligence applications and their impact on society demands the field of Information Science acknowledge the sociotechnical nature of these technologies. Previous definitions of Information Science over the last six decades have inadequately addressed the environmental, human, and social aspects of these technologies. This perspective piece advocates for an expanded definition of Information Science that fully includes the sociotechnical impacts information has on the conduct of research in this field. Proposing an expanded definition of Information Science that includes the sociotechnical aspects of this field should stimulate both conversation and widen the interdisciplinary lens necessary to address how intelligent technologies may be incorporated into society and our lives more fairly.</description>

      <title>Addressing Bias in Generative AI: Challenges and Research Opportunities in Information Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed information management systems but introduced substantial biases that can compromise their effectiveness in informing business decision-making. This challenge presents information management scholars with a unique opportunity to advance the field by identifying and addressing these biases across extensive applications of LLMs. Building on the discussion on bias sources and current methods for detecting and mitigating bias, this paper seeks to identify gaps and opportunities for future research. By incorporating ethical considerations, policy implications, and sociotechnical perspectives, we focus on developing a framework that covers major stakeholders of Generative AI systems, proposing key research questions, and inspiring discussion. Our goal is to provide actionable pathways for researchers to address bias in LLM applications, thereby advancing research in information management that ultimately informs business practices. Our forward-looking framework and research agenda advocate interdisciplinary approaches, innovative methods, dynamic perspectives, and rigorous evaluation to ensure fairness and transparency in Generative AI-driven information systems. We expect this study to serve as a call to action for information management scholars to tackle this critical issue, guiding the improvement of fairness and effectiveness in LLM-based systems for business practice.</description>

      <title>Expert-Agnostic Learning to Defer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) learns autonomous systems to independently manage straightforward cases, while deferring uncertain cases to human experts. Recent advancements in this field have introduced features enabling flexibility to unseen experts at test-time, but we find these approaches have significant limitations. To address these, we introduce EA-L2D: Expert-Agnostic Learning to Defer, a novel L2D framework that leverages a Bayesian approach to model expert behaviour in an expert-agnostic manner, facilitating optimal deferral decisions. EA-L2D offers several critical improvements over prior methods, including the ability to incorporate prior knowledge about experts, a reduced reliance on expert-annotated data, and robust performance when deferring to experts with expertise not seen during training. Evaluating on CIFAR-10, HAM10000, German Traffic Lights, Breast Ultrasound, Axial Organ Slices, and Blood Cell MNIST, we observe performance gains over the next state-of-the-art of 1-16\% for seen experts and 4-28\% for unseen experts in settings with high expert diversity.</description>

      <title>USER-VLM 360: Personalized Vision Language Models with User-aware Tuning for Social Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of vision-language models into robotic systems constitutes a significant advancement in enabling machines to interact with their surroundings in a more intuitive manner. While VLMs offer rich multimodal reasoning, existing approaches lack user-specific adaptability, often relying on generic interaction paradigms that fail to account for individual behavioral, contextual, or socio-emotional nuances. When customization is attempted, ethical concerns arise from unmitigated biases in user data, risking exclusion or unfair treatment. To address these dual challenges, we propose User-VLM 360{\deg}, a holistic framework integrating multimodal user modeling with bias-aware optimization. Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that adapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias mitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\deg} socio-emotive interaction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational metadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features understanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation studies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot validates real-time adaptability across diverse users. We open-source parameter-efficient 3B/10B models and an ethical verification framework for responsible adaptation.</description>

      <title>Unpacking the Layers: Exploring Self-Disclosure Norms, Engagement Dynamics, and Privacy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the self-disclosure behavior of Reddit users across 11 different types of self-disclosure. We find that at least half of the users share some type of disclosure in at least 10% of their posts, with half of these posts having more than one type of disclosure. We show that different types of self-disclosure are likely to receive varying levels of engagement. For instance, a Sexual Orientation disclosure garners more comments than other self-disclosures. We also explore confounding factors that affect future self-disclosure. We show that users who receive interactions from (self-disclosure) specific subreddit members are more likely to disclose in the future. We also show that privacy risks due to self-disclosure extend beyond Reddit users themselves to include their close contacts, such as family and friends, as their information is also revealed. We develop a browser plugin for end-users to flag self-disclosure in their content.</description>

      <title>"Business on WhatsApp is tough now- but am I really a businesswoman?" Exploring Challenges with Adapting to Changes in WhatsApp Business</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how WhatsApp has evolved from a personal communication tool to a professional platform, focusing on its use by small business owners in India. Initially embraced in smaller, rural communities for its ease of use and familiarity, WhatsApp played a crucial role in local economies. However, as Meta introduced WhatsApp Business with new, formalized features, users encountered challenges in adapting to the more complex and costly platform. Interviews with 14 small business owners revealed that while they adapted creatively, they felt marginalized by the advanced tools. This research contributes to HCI literature by exploring the transition from personal to professional use and introduces the concept of Coercive Professionalization. It highlights how standardization by large tech companies affects marginalized users, exacerbating power imbalances and reinforcing digital colonialism, concluding with design implications for supporting community-based appropriations.</description>

      <title>VisPath: Automated Visualization Code Synthesis via Multi-Path Reasoning and Feedback-Driven Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unprecedented breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) has amplified its penetration into application of automated visualization code generation. Few-shot prompting and query expansion techniques have notably enhanced data visualization performance, however, still fail to overcome ambiguity and complexity of natural language queries - imposing an inherent burden for manual human intervention. To mitigate such limitations, we propose a holistic framework VisPath : A Multi-Path Reasoning and Feedback-Driven Optimization Framework for Visualization Code Generation, which systematically enhances code quality through structured reasoning and refinement. VisPath is a multi-stage framework, specially designed to handle underspecified queries. To generate a robust final visualization code, it first utilizes initial query to generate diverse reformulated queries via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, each representing a distinct reasoning path. Refined queries are used to produce candidate visualization scripts, consequently executed to generate multiple images. Comprehensively assessing correctness and quality of outputs, VisPath generates feedback for each image, which are then fed to aggregation module to generate optimal result. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including MatPlotBench and the Qwen-Agent Code Interpreter Benchmark show that VisPath significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, increased up to average 17%, offering a more reliable solution for AI-driven visualization code generation.</description>

      <title>ReLearn: Unlearning via Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

      <title>How Do LLMs Acquire New Knowledge? A Knowledge Circuits Perspective on Continual Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DynamicKnowledgeCircuits.</description>

      <title>Setting the Course, but Forgetting to Steer: Analyzing Compliance with GDPR's Right of Access to Data by Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comprehensibility and reliability of data download packages (DDPs) provided under the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) right of access are vital for both individuals and researchers. These DDPs enable users to understand and control their personal data, yet issues like complexity and incomplete information often limit their utility. Also, despite their growing use in research to study emerging online phenomena, little attention has been given to systematically assessing the reliability and comprehensibility of DDPs.
  To bridge this research gap, in this work, we perform a comparative analysis to assess the comprehensibility and reliability of DDPs provided by three major social media platforms, namely, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. By recruiting 400 participants across four countries, we assess the comprehensibility of DDPs across various requirements, including conciseness, transparency, intelligibility, and clear and plain language. Also, by leveraging automated bots and user-donated DDPs, we evaluate the reliability of DDPs across the three platforms. Among other things, we find notable differences across the three platforms in the data categories included in DDPs, inconsistencies in adherence to the GDPR requirements, and gaps in the reliability of the DDPs across platforms. Finally, using large language models, we demonstrate the feasibility of easily providing more comprehensible DDPs.</description>

      <title>Dialogue-based Explanations for Logical Reasoning using Structured Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in knowledge bases (KBs) is a prominent topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there is some work on this problem, the explanations provided by existing approaches often lack critical information or fail to be expressive enough for non-binary conflicts. In this paper, we identify structural weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and propose a generic argumentation-based approach to address these problems. This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to argumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures to compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics. This allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are more expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.</description>

      <title>Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</description>

      <title>"I'm 73, you can't expect me to have multiple passwords": Password Management Concerns and Solutions of Irish Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on Irish older adult's perceptions, practices, and challenges regarding password management, the goal of this study was to compile suitable advice that can benefit this demographic. To achieve this, we first conducted semi structured interviews (n=37), we then collated advice based on best practice and what we learned from these interviews. We facilitated two independent focus groups (n=31) to evaluate and adjust this advice and tested the finalized advice through an observational study (n=15). The participants were aged between 59 and 86 and came from various counties in Ireland, both rural and urban. The findings revealed that managing multiple passwords was a significant source of frustration, leading some participants to adopt novel and informal strategies for storing them. A notable hesitation to adopt digital password managers and passphrases was also observed. Participants appreciated guidance on improving their password practices, with many affirming that securely writing down passwords was a practical strategy. Irish older adults demonstrated strong intuition regarding cybersecurity, notably expressing concerns over knowledge-based security checks used by banks and government institutions. This study aims to contribute to the aggregation of practical password advice suited to older adults, making password security more manageable and less burdensome for this demographic.</description>

      <title>2FA: Navigating the Challenges and Solutions for Inclusive Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital age requires strong security measures to protect online activities. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) has emerged as a critical solution. However, its implementation presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of accessibility for people with disabilities. This paper examines the intricacies of deploying 2FA in a way that is secure and accessible to all users by outlining the concrete challenges for people who are affected by various types of impairments. This research investigates the implications of 2FA on digital inclusivity and proposes solutions to enhance accessibility. An analysis was conducted to examine the implementation and availability of various 2FA methods across popular online platforms. The results reveal a diverse landscape of authentication strategies. While 2FA significantly improves account security, its current adoption is hampered by inconsistencies across platforms and a lack of standardised, accessible options for users with disabilities. Future advancements in 2FA technologies, including but not limited to autofill capabilities and the adoption of Fast IDentity Onlines (FIDO) protocols, offer possible directions for more inclusive authentication mechanisms. However, ongoing research is necessary to address the evolving needs of users with disabilities and to mitigate new security challenges. This paper proposes a collaborative approach among stakeholders to ensure that security improvements do not compromise accessibility. It promotes a digital environment where security and inclusivity mutually reinforce each other.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Human Handover Intentions in Human-Robot Collaboration: Comparing EEG, Gaze, and Hand Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) relies on accurate and timely recognition of human intentions to ensure seamless interactions. Among common HRC tasks, human-to-robot object handovers have been studied extensively for planning the robot's actions during object reception, assuming the human intention for object handover. However, distinguishing handover intentions from other actions has received limited attention. Most research on handovers has focused on visually detecting motion trajectories, which often results in delays or false detections when trajectories overlap. This paper investigates whether human intentions for object handovers are reflected in non-movement-based physiological signals. We conduct a multimodal analysis comparing three data modalities: electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze, and hand-motion signals. Our study aims to distinguish between handover-intended human motions and non-handover motions in an HRC setting, evaluating each modality's performance in predicting and classifying these actions before and after human movement initiation. We develop and evaluate human intention detectors based on these modalities, comparing their accuracy and timing in identifying handover intentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically develop and test intention detectors across multiple modalities within the same experimental context of human-robot handovers. Our analysis reveals that handover intention can be detected from all three modalities. Nevertheless, gaze signals are the earliest as well as the most accurate to classify the motion as intended for handover or non-handover.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11946v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential. However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio.</description>

Abstract: Integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has opened new frontiers in brain signal decoding, enabling assistive communication, neural representation learning, and multimodal integration. BCIs, particularly those leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG), provide a non-invasive means of translating neural activity into meaningful outputs. Recent advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved EEG-based generation of images, text, and speech. This paper provides a literature review of the state-of-the-art in EEG-based multimodal generation, focusing on (i) EEG-to-image generation through GANs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models, and (ii) EEG-to-text generation leveraging Transformer based language models and contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we discuss the emerging domain of EEG-to-speech synthesis, an evolving multimodal frontier. We highlight key datasets, use cases, challenges, and EEG feature encoding methods that underpin generative approaches. By providing a structured overview of EEG-based generative AI, this survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with insights to advance neural decoding, enhance assistive technologies, and expand the frontiers of brain-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory.</description>

      <title>Participant Perceptions of a Robotic Coach Conducting Positive Psychology Exercises: A Qualitative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a qualitative analysis of participants' perceptions of a robotic coach conducting Positive Psychology exercises, providing insights for the future design of robotic coaches. Participants (n = 20) took part in a single-session (avg. 31 +- 10 minutes) Human-Robot Interaction study in a laboratory setting. We created the design of the robotic coach, and its affective adaptation, based on user-centred design research and collaboration with a professional coach. We transcribed post-study participant interviews and conducted a Thematic Analysis. We discuss the results of that analysis, presenting aspects participants found particularly helpful (e.g., the robot asked the correct questions and helped them think of new positive things in their life), and what should be improved (e.g., the robot's utterance content should be more responsive). We found that participants had no clear preference for affective adaptation or no affective adaptation, which may be due to both positive and negative user perceptions being heightened in the case of adaptation. Based on our qualitative analysis, we highlight insights for the future design of robotic coaches, and areas for future investigation (e.g., examining how participants with different personality traits, or participants experiencing isolation, could benefit from an interaction with a robotic coach).</description>

      <title>The Partner Modelling Questionnaire: A validated self-report measure of perceptions toward machines as dialogue partners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has looked to understand user perceptions of speech agent capabilities as dialogue partners (termed partner models), and how this affects user interaction. Yet, currently partner model effects are inferred from language production as no metrics are available to quantify these subjective perceptions more directly. Through three studies, we develop and validate the Partner Modelling Questionnaire (PMQ): an 18-item self-report semantic differential scale designed to reliably measure people's partner models of non-embodied speech interfaces. Through principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, we show that the PMQ scale consists of three factors: communicative competence and dependability, human-likeness in communication, and communicative flexibility. Our studies show that the measure consistently demonstrates good internal reliability, strong test-retest reliability over 12 and 4-week intervals, and predictable convergent/divergent validity. Based on our findings we discuss the multidimensional nature of partner models, whilst identifying key future research avenues that the development of the PMQ facilitates. Notably, this includes the need to identify the activation, sensitivity, and dynamism of partner models in speech interface interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones are integral to modern life, yet research highlights the cognitive drawbacks associated with their mere presence. While physically removing them can mitigate these effects, it is often inconvenient and may heighten anxiety due to prolonged separation. To address this, we use holographic augmented reality (AR) displays to visually diminish distractions with two interventions: 1) Visual Camouflage, which disguises the smartphone with a hologram that matches its size and blends with the background, making it less noticeable, and 2) Visual Substitution, which occludes the smartphone with a contextually relevant hologram, like books on a desk. In a study with 60 participants, we compared cognitive performance with the smartphone nearby, remote, and visually diminished by our AR interventions. Our findings show that the interventions significantly reduce cognitive impairment, with effects comparable to physically removing the smartphone. The adaptability of our approach opens new avenues to manage visual distractions in daily life.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study of Child Wellbeing Assessment via Online Interactions with a Social Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Socially Assistive Robots are studied in different Child-Robot Interaction settings. However, logistical constraints limit accessibility, particularly affecting timely support for mental wellbeing. In this work, we have investigated whether online interactions with a robot can be used for the assessment of mental wellbeing in children. The children (N=40, 20 girls and 20 boys; 8-13 years) interacted with the Nao robot (30-45 mins) over three sessions, at least a week apart. Audio-visual recordings were collected throughout the sessions that concluded with the children answering user perception questionnaires pertaining to their anxiety towards the robot, and the robot's abilities. We divided the participants into three wellbeing clusters (low, med and high tertiles) using their responses to the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and further analysed how their wellbeing and their perceptions of the robot changed over the wellbeing tertiles, across sessions and across participants' gender. Our primary findings suggest that (I) online mediated-interactions with robots can be effective in assessing children's mental wellbeing over time, and (II) children's overall perception of the robot either improved or remained consistent across time. Supplementary exploratory analyses have also revealed that the gender of the children affected their wellbeing assessments with interactions effectively distinguishing between varying levels of wellbeing for both boys and girls for the first session and only for boys during the second session. The analyses have also revealed that girls have a higher opinion of the robot as a confidante as compared with boys. Findings from this work affirm the potential of using online mediated interactions with robots for the assessment of the mental wellbeing of children.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of inductive program synthesis is for a machine to automatically generate a program from user-supplied examples. A key underlying assumption is that humans can provide sufficient examples to teach a concept to a machine. To evaluate the validity of this assumption, we conduct a study where human participants provide examples for six programming concepts, such as finding the maximum element of a list. We evaluate the generalisation performance of five program synthesis systems trained on input-output examples (i) from non-expert humans, (ii) from a human expert, and (iii) randomly sampled. Our results suggest that non-experts typically do not provide sufficient examples for a program synthesis system to learn an accurate program.</description>

      <title>TexSenseGAN: A User-Guided System for Optimizing Texture-Related Vibrotactile Feedback Using Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11467v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.</description>

      <title>Artworks Reimagined: Exploring Human-AI Co-Creation through Body Prompting</title>

Abstract: Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a popular activity. However, text-to-image generation - where images are produced from typed prompts - can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of installations at public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience to the installation's visitors. We present insights into participants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.</description>

      <title>Human Creativity in the Age of LLMs: Randomized Experiments on Divergent and Convergent Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are transforming the creative process by offering unprecedented capabilities to algorithmically generate ideas. While these tools can enhance human creativity when people co-create with them, it's unclear how this will impact unassisted human creativity. We conducted two large pre-registered parallel experiments involving 1,100 participants attempting tasks targeting the two core components of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking. We compare the effects of two forms of large language model (LLM) assistance -- a standard LLM providing direct answers and a coach-like LLM offering guidance -- with a control group receiving no AI assistance, and focus particularly on how all groups perform in a final, unassisted stage. Our findings reveal that while LLM assistance can provide short-term boosts in creativity during assisted tasks, it may inadvertently hinder independent creative performance when users work without assistance, raising concerns about the long-term impact on human creativity and cognition.</description>

      <title>Drillboards: Adaptive Visualization Dashboards for Dynamic Personalization of Visualization Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present drillboards, a technique for adaptive visualization dashboards consisting of a hierarchy of coordinated charts that the user can drill down to reach a desired level of detail depending on their expertise, interest, and desired effort. This functionality allows different users to personalize the same dashboard to their specific needs and expertise. The technique is based on a formal vocabulary of chart representations and rules for merging multiple charts of different types and data into single composite representations. The drillboard hierarchy is created by iteratively applying these rules starting from a baseline dashboard, with each consecutive operation yielding a new dashboard with fewer charts and progressively more abstract and simplified views. We also present an authoring tool for building drillboards and show how experts users can use to build up and deliver personalized experiences to a wide audience. Our evaluation asked three domain experts to author drillboards for their own datasets, which we then showed to casual end-users with favorable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a Playful yet Offensive Tourist: Exploring Tensions Between Playful Features and Citizen Concerns in Designing Urban Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Play is pivotal in fostering the emotional, social, and cultural dimensions of urban spaces. While generative AI (GAI) potentially supports playful urban interaction, a balanced and critical approach to the design opportunities and challenges is needed. This work develops iWonder, an image-to-image GAI tool engaging fourteen designers in urban explorations to identify GAI's playful features and create design ideas. Fourteen citizens then evaluated these ideas, providing expectations and critical concerns from a bottom-up perspective. Our findings reveal the dynamic interplay between users, GAI, and urban contexts, highlighting GAI's potential to facilitate playful urban experiences through generative agency, meaningful unpredictability, social performativity, and the associated offensive qualities. We propose design considerations to address citizen concerns and the `tourist metaphor' to deepen our understanding of GAI's impact, offering insights to enhance cities' socio-cultural fabric. Overall, this research contributes to the effort to harness GAI's capabilities for urban enrichment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal LLM for Inspirational User Interface Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspirational search, the process of exploring designs to inform and inspire new creative work, is pivotal in mobile user interface (UI) design. However, exploring the vast space of UI references remains a challenge. Existing AI-based UI search methods often miss crucial semantics like target users or the mood of apps. Additionally, these models typically require metadata like view hierarchies, limiting their practical use. We used a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to extract and interpret semantics from mobile UI images. We identified key UI semantics through a formative study and developed a semantic-based UI search system. Through computational and human evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing UI retrieval methods, offering UI designers a more enriched and contextually relevant search experience. We enhance the understanding of mobile UI design semantics and highlight MLLMs' potential in inspirational search, providing a rich dataset of UI semantics for future studies.</description>

      <title>Encountering Robotic Art: The Social, Material, and Temporal Processes of Creation with Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots extend beyond the tools of productivity; they also contribute to creativity. While typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored. This paper examines how robots participate in artistic creation. Through semi-structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dynamics in facilitating creativity. Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose several implications for socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing systems. These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible computing.</description>

      <title>ScholaWrite: A Dataset of End-to-End Scholarly Writing Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Writing is a cognitively demanding task involving continuous decision-making, heavy use of working memory, and frequent switching between multiple activities. Scholarly writing is particularly complex as it requires authors to coordinate many pieces of multiform knowledge. To fully understand writers' cognitive thought process, one should fully decode the end-to-end writing data (from individual ideas to final manuscript) and understand their complex cognitive mechanisms in scholarly writing. We introduce ScholaWrite dataset, a first-of-its-kind keystroke corpus of an end-to-end scholarly writing process for complete manuscripts, with thorough annotations of cognitive writing intentions behind each keystroke. Our dataset includes LaTeX-based keystroke data from five preprints with nearly 62K total text changes and annotations across 4 months of paper writing. ScholaWrite shows promising usability and applications (e.g., iterative self-writing), demonstrating the importance of collection of end-to-end writing data, rather than the final manuscript, for the development of future writing assistants to support the cognitive thinking process of scientists. Our de-identified data examples and code are available on our project page.</description>

      <title>From Clicks to Conversations: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Conversational Agents in Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of data science forced different groups of individuals with different backgrounds to adapt to statistical analysis. We hypothesize that conversational agents are better suited for statistical analysis than traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI). In this work, we propose a novel conversational agent, StatZ, for statistical analysis. We evaluate the efficacy of StatZ relative to established statistical software:SPSS, SAS, Stata, and JMP in terms of accuracy, task completion time, user experience, and user satisfaction. We combined the proposed analysis question from state-of-the-art language models with suggestions from statistical analysis experts and tested with 51 participants from diverse backgrounds. Our experimental design assessed each participant's ability to perform statistical analysis tasks using traditional statistical analysis tools with GUI and our conversational agent. Results indicate that the proposed conversational agents significantly outperform GUI statistical software in all assessed metrics, including quantitative (task completion time, accuracy, and user experience), and qualitative (user satisfaction) metrics. Our findings underscore the potential of using conversational agents to enhance statistical analysis processes, reducing cognitive load and learning curves and thereby proliferating data analysis capabilities, to individuals with limited knowledge of statistics.</description>

      <title>Position and Rotation Invariant Sign Language Recognition from 3D Kinect Data with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.12669v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign language is a gesture-based symbolic communication medium among speech and hearing impaired people. It also serves as a communication bridge between non-impaired and impaired populations. Unfortunately, in most situations, a non-impaired person is not well conversant in such symbolic languages restricting the natural information flow between these two categories. Therefore, an automated translation mechanism that seamlessly translates sign language into natural language can be highly advantageous. In this paper, we attempt to perform recognition of 30 basic Indian sign gestures. Gestures are represented as temporal sequences of 3D maps (RGB + depth), each consisting of 3D coordinates of 20 body joints captured by the Kinect sensor. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. To improve the classifier's performance, we use geometric transformation for the alignment correction of depth frames. In our experiments, the model achieves 84.81% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sociodemographic Prompting is Not Yet an Effective Approach for Simulating Subjective Judgments with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human judgments are inherently subjective and are actively affected by personal traits such as gender and ethnicity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to simulate human responses across diverse contexts, their ability to account for demographic differences in subjective tasks remains uncertain. In this study, leveraging the POPQUORN dataset, we evaluate nine popular LLMs on their ability to understand demographic differences in two subjective judgment tasks: politeness and offensiveness. We find that in zero-shot settings, most models' predictions for both tasks align more closely with labels from White participants than those from Asian or Black participants, while only a minor gender bias favoring women appears in the politeness task. Furthermore, sociodemographic prompting does not consistently improve and, in some cases, worsens LLMs' ability to perceive language from specific sub-populations. These findings highlight potential demographic biases in LLMs when performing subjective judgment tasks and underscore the limitations of sociodemographic prompting as a strategy to achieve pluralistic alignment. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Jiaxin-Pei/LLM-as-Subjective-Judge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online discussion forums provide crucial data to understand the concerns of a wide range of real-world communities. However, the typical qualitative and quantitative methodologies used to analyze those data, such as thematic analysis and topic modeling, are infeasible to scale or require significant human effort to translate outputs to human readable forms. This study introduces QuaLLM, a novel LLM-based framework to analyze and extract quantitative insights from text data on online forums. The framework consists of a novel prompting and human evaluation methodology. We applied this framework to analyze over one million comments from two of Reddit's rideshare worker communities, marking the largest study of its type. We uncover significant worker concerns regarding AI and algorithmic platform decisions, responding to regulatory calls about worker insights. In short, our work sets a new precedent for AI-assisted quantitative data analysis to surface concerns from online forums.</description>

      <title>NarrativeBridge: Enhancing Video Captioning with Causal-Temporal Narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing video captioning benchmarks and models lack causal-temporal narrative, which is sequences of events linked through cause and effect, unfolding over time and driven by characters or agents. This lack of narrative restricts models' ability to generate text descriptions that capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in video content. To address this gap, we propose NarrativeBridge, an approach comprising of: (1) a novel Causal-Temporal Narrative (CTN) captions benchmark generated using a large language model and few-shot prompting, explicitly encoding cause-effect temporal relationships in video descriptions; and (2) a Cause-Effect Network (CEN) with separate encoders for capturing cause and effect dynamics, enabling effective learning and generation of captions with causal-temporal narrative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in articulating the causal and temporal aspects of video content: 17.88 and 17.44 CIDEr on the MSVD-CTN and MSRVTT-CTN datasets, respectively. Cross-dataset evaluations further showcase CEN's strong generalization capabilities. The proposed framework understands and generates nuanced text descriptions with intricate causal-temporal narrative structures present in videos, addressing a critical limitation in video captioning.

      <title>Rideshare Transparency: Translating Gig Worker Insights on AI Platform Design to Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rideshare platforms exert significant control over workers through algorithmic systems that can result in financial, emotional, and physical harm. What steps can platforms, designers, and practitioners take to mitigate these negative impacts and meet worker needs? In this paper, we identify transparency-related harms, mitigation strategies, and worker needs while validating and contextualizing our findings within the broader worker community. We use a novel mixed-methods study combining an LLM-based analysis of over 1 million comments posted to online platform worker communities with semi-structured interviews with workers. Our findings expose a transparency gap between existing platform designs and the information drivers need, particularly concerning promotions, fares, routes, and task allocation. Our analysis suggests that rideshare workers need key pieces of information, which we refer to as indicators, to make informed work decisions. These indicators include details about rides, driver statistics, algorithmic implementation details, and platform policy information. We argue that instead of relying on platforms to include such information in their designs, new regulations requiring platforms to publish public transparency reports may be a more effective solution to improve worker well-being. We offer recommendations for implementing such a policy.</description>

      <title>Talking Wikidata: Communication patterns and their impact on community engagement in collaborative knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study collaboration patterns of Wikidata, one of the world's largest open source collaborative knowledge graph (KG) communities. Collaborative KG communities, play a key role in structuring machine-readable knowledge to support AI systems like conversational agents. However, these communities face challenges related to long-term member engagement, as a small subset of contributors often is responsible for the majority of contributions and decision-making. While prior research has explored contributors' roles and lifespans, discussions within collaborative KG communities remain understudied. To fill this gap, we investigated the behavioural patterns of contributors and factors affecting their communication and participation. We analysed all the discussions on Wikidata using a mixed methods approach, including statistical tests, network analysis, and text and graph embedding representations. Our findings reveal that the interactions between Wikidata editors form a small world network, resilient to dropouts and inclusive, where both the network topology and discussion content influence the continuity of conversations. Furthermore, the account age of Wikidata members and their conversations are significant factors in their long-term engagement with the project. Our observations and recommendations can benefit the Wikidata and semantic web communities, providing guidance on how to improve collaborative environments for sustainability, growth, and quality.</description>

      <title>Can AI writing be salvaged? Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits</title>

Abstract: LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. cliches, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, we explored automatic editing methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD): oncept, Benchmark, Experiments, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the broader usage and highly successful development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a growth of interest and demand for applying LLMs to autonomous driving technology. Driven by their natural language understanding and reasoning ability, LLMs have the potential to enhance various aspects of autonomous driving systems, from perception and scene understanding to language interaction and decision-making. In this paper, we first introduce the novel concept of designing LLMs for autonomous driving (LLM4AD). Then, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following abilities of LLM4AD in simulation. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments on real-world vehicle platforms, thoroughly evaluating the performance and potential of our LLM4AD systems. Finally, we envision the main challenges of LLM4AD, including latency, deployment, security and privacy, safety, trust and transparency, and personalization. Our research highlights the significant potential of LLMs to enhance various aspects of autonomous vehicle technology, from perception and scene understanding to language interaction and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Step Guided Reasoning: Improving Mathematical Reasoning using Guidance Generation and Step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has been challenging for large language models (LLMs). However, the introduction of step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference has significantly advanced the mathematical capabilities of LLMs. Despite this progress, current approaches either necessitate extensive inference datasets for training or depend on few-shot methods that frequently compromise computational accuracy. To address these bottlenecks in mathematical reasoning, we propose a novel method called Step Guidied Reasoning, which is more stable and generalizable than few-shot methods and does not involve further fine-tuning of the model. In this approach, LLMs reflect on small reasoning steps, similar to how humans deliberate and focus attention on what to do next. By incorporating this reflective process into the inference stage, LLMs can effectively guide their reasoning from one step to the next. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the significant effect of Step Guidied Reasoning in augmenting mathematical performance in state-of-the-art language models. Qwen2-72B-Instruct outperforms its math-specific counterpart, Qwen2.5-72B-Math-Instruct, on MMLU- STEM with a score of 90.9%, compared to 87.3%. The average scores of Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct increase from 27.1% to 36.3% and from 36.5% to 47.4% on the mathematics domain, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Prompt Steerability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building pluralistic AI requires designing models that are able to be shaped to represent a wide range of value systems and cultures. Achieving this requires first being able to evaluate the degree to which a given model is capable of reflecting various personas. To this end, we propose a benchmark for evaluating the steerability of model personas as a function of prompting. Our design is based on a formal definition of prompt steerability, which analyzes the degree to which a model's joint behavioral distribution can be shifted from its baseline. By defining steerability indices and inspecting how these indices change as a function of steering effort, we can estimate the steerability of a model across various persona dimensions and directions. Our benchmark reveals that the steerability of many current models is limited -- due to both a skew in their baseline behavior and an asymmetry in their steerability across many persona dimensions. We release an implementation of our benchmark at https://github.com/IBM/prompt-steering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural heritage, a testament to human history and civilization, has gained increasing recognition for its significance in preservation and dissemination. The integration of immersive technologies has transformed how cultural heritage is presented, enabling audiences to engage with it in more vivid, intuitive, and interactive ways. However, the adoption of these technologies also brings a range of challenges and potential risks. This paper presents a systematic review, with an in-depth analysis of 177 selected papers. We comprehensively examine and categorize current applications, technological approaches, and user devices in immersive cultural heritage presentations, while also highlighting the associated risks and challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research in the immersive presentation of cultural heritage. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners, enhancing understanding of the technological applications, risks, and challenges in this field, and encouraging further innovation and development.</description>

      <title>HammerBench: Fine-Grained Function-Calling Evaluation in Real Mobile Device Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of LLMs in multi-turn human-agent interactions presents significant challenges, particularly due to the complexity and variability of user behavior. In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications.</description>

      <title>AI Guide Dog: Egocentric Path Prediction on Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AI Guide Dog (AIGD), a lightweight egocentric (first-person) navigation system for visually impaired users, designed for real-time deployment on smartphones. AIGD employs a vision-only multi-label classification approach to predict directional commands, ensuring safe navigation across diverse environments. We introduce a novel technique for goal-based outdoor navigation by integrating GPS signals and high-level directions, while also handling uncertain multi-path predictions for destination-free indoor navigation. As the first navigation assistance system to handle both goal-oriented and exploratory navigation across indoor and outdoor settings, AIGD establishes a new benchmark in blind navigation. We present methods, datasets, evaluations, and deployment insights to encourage further innovations in assistive navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Code Style Sheets: CSS for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Program text is rendered using impoverished typographic styles. Beyond choice of fonts and syntax-highlighting colors, code editors and related tools utilize very few text decorations. These limited styles are, furthermore, applied in monolithic fashion, regardless of the programs and tasks at hand.
  We present the notion of code style sheets for styling program text. Motivated by analogy to cascading style sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents, code style sheets provide mechanisms for defining rules to select elements from an abstract syntax tree (AST) in order to style their corresponding visual representation. Technically, our selector language generalizes essential notions from CSS to a programming-language setting with algebraic data types (such as ASTs). Practically, code style sheets allow ASTs to be styled granularly, based on semantic information -- such as the structure of abstract syntax, static type information, and corresponding run-time values -- as well as design choices on the part of authors and readers of a program. Because programs are heavily nested in structure, a key aspect of our design is a layout algorithm that renders nested, multiline text blocks more compactly than in existing box-based layout systems such as HTML.
  In this paper, we design and implement a code style sheets system for a subset of Haskell, using it to illustrate several code presentation and visualization tasks. These examples demonstrate that code style sheets provide a uniform framework for rendering programs in multivarious ways, which could be employed in future designs for text-based as well as structure editors.</description>
