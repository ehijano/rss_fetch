      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Non-geometrical perturbation on homogeneous stealth dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a non-geometrical perturbation to the stealth field, which means the background remains invariant. The stealh is homogeneous in a universe whose source is dust and demand that perturbation unchanged density. As a regular procedure, we introduce a parameter $\lambda$ to perturb the scalar field equation and get an intriguing expression of the equation, similar to a series expansion in $\lambda$. From this procedure, we distinguish and approach to discriminate solutions, and the numerical solutions show that the most significant contribution to the solution comes from the linear term of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>'Dark pressure': A metric that yields distance-independent circular orbital speed in deep space with 'tunable' total mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity, the tangential speed of objects in stable circular orbits is not uniquely described by the orbital radius and the mass present inside the orbital radius. This work presents a static, spherically symmetric spacetime metric which produces stable circular orbits whose speed approaches a constant value at high radii. The orbital speed is independent of the mass contained within the orbital radius, however, there is pressure throughout the spacetime. The stress energy tensor of this metric is evaluated numerically using the mass of the Milky Way's central black hole, the orbital speed of its distant satellites, and three different values of a unitless 'mass tuning' parameter B. These B 'tune' the amount of mass present, without violating the Weak Energy Condition (WEC) at any evaluated spacetime point. The metric can be merged with a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, in which case it achieves isotropy and obeys the Friedmann equations at cosmological distances.</description>

      <title>Photonic single-arm gravitational wave detectors based on the quantum state transition of orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantum state transition of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the present of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate the potential of a new photonic single-arm GW detection technique. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime. It is demonstrated that when a photon possessing OAM of 1 interacts with GWs, it may relinquish its OAM and produce a central signal that may be detected. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in the low-frequency range ($&lt;1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in the mid-frequency range ($1\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary GW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the high-frequency range ($&gt;10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector parameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is proportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors. This technique not only facilitates the extraction of GW information but also creates a new approach for identifying and selecting GW signals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by curvature : Analysis via non-perturbative 2PI Hartree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a classical background spacetime's curvature, via the 2 particle irreducible (2PI) non-perturbative effective action formalism. We use the standard Schwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator, appropriate to probe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics. Recently it was shown using perturbative computations that such SSB is possible with a scalar with a quartic self interaction, positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling. Here we confirm in the two loop Hartree approximation that curvature can indeed induce SSB for such a theory. SSB for such a model is not possible in a flat spacetime. The 2PI technique does not only resum the self energy resulting in mass generation, but also resums, as we have discussed, curvature terms through such mass generation. We have explicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime, although our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. We show that, in contrast to the perturbative results, SSB is possible with a vanishing non-minimal coupling. These results are further extended to the case of an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Restoration of the broken symmetry in the thermal case is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit example, where the Hawking temperature of a black hole horizon is compatible with the black hole's R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic description, is constructed. It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived, where the Hawking temperature is identical with the R\'enyi temperature, i.e. the one obtained from the R\'enyi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of thermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely determined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the R\'enyi parameter, {\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by which preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <title>Higher-order photon rings of an ultracompact object and their interferometric pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A horizonless ultracompact object can have a stable antiphoton sphere, which causes the strong deflection of photons inside the unstable photon sphere, leading to the formation of distinctive inner photon rings. In this work, we present analytical descriptions for the shape, thickness and interference pattern of higher-order inner photon rings. By taking the static spherically symmetric Schwarzschild star with a photon sphere as an example, we find that its inner photon rings can be more non-circular and thicker than the outer ones, and show that the inclusion of the inner photon rings can give rise to new features in the interferometric pattern. Our formulae can also be applied to other ultracompact objects, providing a convenient way to study the observational properties of their higher-order photon rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16764v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>

      <title>Toroidal black holes in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a purely geometric (kinematic) perspective, black holes in four dimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is only when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's shape is constrained to be spherical. Despite this, exploring exotic horizon topologies remains theoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of General Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. In the axisymmetric case, besides the well-known spherical topology, only a toroidal topology is consistent with the symmetry. Complete solutions, describing the entire exterior region of such toroidal black holes without singularities, have not been reported yet. To the best of our knowledge, the construction we present here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in four spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.</description>

      <title>Modeling a Non-Singular Universe with Late-Time Acceleration through a Novel Inhomogeneous Barotropic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effects of incorporating barotropic fluids on cosmological solutions within the general relativity (GR) framework. We proposed a modified version of the barotropic fluid with the EoS, $p=\zeta _0 \rho +\zeta _1 \rho \left(t-t_0\right){}^{-2 n}$, where $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $t_0$ and $n$ are some constants. Our goal is to explore if this type of EoS might help explain the universe's development, concentrating on the scenario where the universe bounces instead of singularities. Interestingly the generic solutions derived from our model are sufficiently adaptable to illustrate the bounce scenario, cosmic inflation and late-time dark-energy behaviour. The parameters $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $t_0$, and $n$ define the universe's phase in this non-singular solution. We investigated several elements of cosmic development, including as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and energy conditions, in order to validate our model. Stability analysis showed that the perturbations approach to zero as the time evolves, indicating the model is stable under scalar perturbation. Additionally, we looked at the statefinder diagnostics and Hubble flow dynamics to get more understanding of the model's dark energy and inflationary behaviour, respectively. Additionally, we conducted a study of the models' relevance to the observational datasets from BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the static solutions with rotational symmetry in the nonprojectable Ho\v{r}ava theory in 2+1 dimensions. We consider all inequivalent terms of the effective theory, including the cosmological constant. We find two distinct types of solutions: the first one corresponds to a Lifshitz solution, while the second one is obtained through a coordinate transformation of the equations of motion. This exact solution does not exhibit Lifshitz behavior and features a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>Initial data rigidity implies spacetime rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit the initial data rigidity theorem of Eichmair, Galloway and Mendes (arxiv:2009.09527). The goal is to strengthen their result by showing that the initial data sets concerned carry a vector field that is lightlike and parallel in an ambient sense. This will be used in a second step to show that among the spacetimes satisfying the dominant energy condition there exists locally essentially one spacetime extending these initial data sets. This local uniqueness theorem also applies in the context of other initial data rigidity theorems. Notably, the one in the spin case due the author (arxiv:2304.02331) and a recent study of the mass zero case in the positive energy theorem due to Hirsch and Zhang (arxiv:2403.15984).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct postcarrollian gravity models in two, three, and four spacetime dimensions by applying algebraic expansion methods. As a byproduct, we present the most general postcarrollian 2d dilaton gravity model, construct its solutions and discuss some boundary aspects, including Schwarzian-type boundary actions. In 3d, we propose Brown-Henneaux-like boundary conditions, generalizing a corresponding Carrollian analysis, and derive the postcarrollian asymptotic symmetry algebra with its central extensions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Horizons and Thermalization in an Atomic Chain and its Relation to Quantum Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sine model, a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian featuring hoppings with a sinusoidal dependence on position, and demonstrate the formation of synthetic horizons where electronic wave packets exhibit exponential slowdown. Interestingly, employing the exact transformation between this model and the Harper equation, which describes the eigenstates of a square lattice tight-binding model subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, we find that analogous semi-classical horizons can emerge in a quantum Hall setup at half-filling for specific values of the magnetic flux. Furthermore, by applying sudden quenches to the sine model's hopping profile, we observe the emergence of thermal states characterized by an Unruh temperature. Our numerical calculations of this temperature reveal a non-universal behavior, suggesting the involvement of physical mechanisms beyond a simple low-energy description.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars: anisotropy model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build slowly rotating anisotropic neutron stars using the Hartle-Thorne formalism, employing three distinct anisotropy models--Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and a covariant model--to characterize the relationship between radial and tangential pressure. We analyze how anisotropy influences stellar properties such as the mass-radius relation, angular momentum, moment of inertia, and binding energy. Our findings reveal that the maximum stable mass of non-rotating stars depends strongly on the anisotropy model, with some configurations supporting up to 60% more mass than their isotropic counterparts with the same central density. This mass increase is most pronounced in the models where the anisotropy grows toward the star's surface, as seen in the covariant model. Furthermore, slowly rotating anisotropic stars adhere to universal relations for the moment of inertia and binding energy, regardless of the chosen anisotropy model or equation of state.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-$k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ at an even level $k\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. Our approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces and develop the representation theory. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$ and closely connects to the infinite-dimensional $*$-representation of the quantum deformed Lorentz group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^2)]$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $|b|=1$. The quantum group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$ also emerges from the quantum gauge transformations of the complex Chern-Simons theory. Focusing on a $m$-holed sphere $\Sigma_{0,m}$, the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ is identified by imposing the gauge invariance and the flatness constraint. The states in $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ are the $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$-invariant linear functionals on a dense domain in $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $\Sigma_{0,m}$ are diagonalized.</description>

      <title>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Outer regions of galaxy clusters as a new probe to test modifications to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the caustic technique to samples of galaxy clusters stacked in redshift space to estimate the gravitational potential in the cluster's outer region and test modifications to the standard theory of gravity. We separate 122 galaxy clusters from the HeCS-SZ, HeCS-redMapper, and HeCS samples into four samples with increasing mass; we estimate four robust, highly constraining caustic profiles for these samples. The caustic masses of the four stacked clusters agree within $ 10\%$ with the corresponding median values of each cluster sample. By adopting the NFW density profile to model the gravitational potential, we recover the caustic profile $\mathcal{A}(r)$ up to radius $r_{\rm p} \sim 4.0\, {\rm Mpc}$. This comparison is a first-order validation of the mass-concentration relation for galaxy clusters expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We thus impose this correlation as a prior in our analysis. Based on our stacked clusters, we estimate the value of the filling factor, which enters the caustic technique, $\mathcal{F}_{\beta} = 0.59\pm 0.05$; we derive this value using real data alone and find it consistent with the value usually adopted in the literature. We then use the caustic profiles $\mathcal{A}(r)$ of the stacked clusters to constrain the chameleon gravity model. We find that the caustic profiles provide a stringent upper limit of $|f_{\rm R0}| \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-6}$ at $95\%$ C.L. limits in the $f(\mathcal{R})$ scenario. The formalism developed here shall be further refined to test modifications to gravity in the extended outer weak gravitational regions of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Warped Solutions from Type IIB Orientifold Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in Type IIB supergravity of the form ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$, where ${\rm WAdS}_3$ and ${\rm WS^3}$ denote a warped anti-de Sitter spacetime and a warped 3-sphere, respectively, while $T^4$ denotes an internal 4-torus. These backgrounds are constructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$, $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ ungauged supergravity resulting from the compactification of Type IIB supergravity on a $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$-orientifold. More specifically, the supersymmetric solutions are ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$ with lightlike warped AdS$_3$ and ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm S}^3\times T^4$ in which the warping of AdS$_3$ is generic. Moreover, we also construct solutions in the form of a warped product $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}\times_{{\rm w}} \mathrm{S}^3\times T^4$ of a 2-parameter deformation $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}$ of ${\rm AdS}_3$ and a three-sphere. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions.</description>

      <title>Hint towards inconsistency between BAO and Supernovae Dataset: The Evidence of Redshift Evolving Dark Energy from DESI DR2 is Absent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of independent cosmological datasets is a route towards precision and accurate inference of the cosmological parameters if these observations are not contaminated by systematic effects. However, the presence of unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased inference of the cosmological parameters. In this work, we test the consistency of the two independent tracers of the low-redshift cosmic expansion, namely the supernovae dataset from Pantheon$+$ and the BAO dataset from DESI DR2 using the distance duality relation which is a cornerstone relation in cosmology under the framework of General Relativity. We find that these datasets violate the distance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution, hinting toward unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts. Coincidentally this effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae dataset and DESI datasets are combined without accounting for this inconsistency. Accounting for this effect in the likelihood refutes the previous claim of evidence of non-cosmological constant as dark energy model from DESI DR2, and shows a result consistent with cosmological constant with $w_0= -0.92\pm 0.08$ and $w_a= -0.49^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$. This indicates that the current conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due to the combination of two inconsistent datasets resulting in precise but inaccurate inference of cosmological parameters. In the future, tests of this kind for the consistency between different cosmological datasets will be essential for robust inference of cosmological parameters and for deciphering unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts from supernovae and BAO datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the role of the discontinuity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode)--intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy--can rival the contribution of the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\sim 10\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\sim$5\%-10\% of $\Delta \phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\sim 1\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\%-2\%$. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-reduced Loop Quantum Gravity: Plane Waves, Flat Space and the Hamiltonian Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity methods are applied to a symmetry-reduced model with homogeneity in two dimensions, derived from a Gowdy model [5,6]. The conditions for propagation of unidirectional plane gravitational waves at exactly the speed of light are set up in form of null Killing equations in terms of Ashtekar variables and imposed as operators on quantum states of the system. Due to the effective one-dimensionality, holonomies and holonomy operators appear as simple phase factors. In correspondence, state functions might be considered as U(1) elements with the usual inner product. Under the assumption of equal spacing of the eigenvalues of geometrical quantities the solutions are not normalizable in this sense. With decreasing spacing for growing eigenvalues, as introduced for example in [11], the situation becomes worse. Taking over the inner product from the genuine gauge group SU(2) of LQG renders the obtained states normalizable, nevertheless fluctuations of geometrical quantities remain divergent. In consequence, the solutions of the Killing conditions are modified, which means allowing for small fluctuations of the propagation speed, i. e. dispersion of gravitational waves. Vacuum fluctuations of Minkowski space are sketched. Finally the same methods are applied to the Hamiltonian constraint with the same result concerning normalizability. With such a modification also the constraint is not exactly satisfied any more, which indicates the necessary presence of some kind of interacting matter.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii)the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharonov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry can be interpreted as a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <title>Cosmic reverberations on a constrained $ f(Q,T) $-model of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an isotropic cosmological model in the $ f(Q, T) $ theory of gravity in the frame of a flat FLRW spacetime being $ Q $ the non-metricity tensor and $ T $ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The gravity function is taken to be a quadratic equation, $ f(Q, T)=\zeta Q^2 + \gamma T $, where $ \zeta&lt;0 $ and $ \gamma $ are the arbitrary constants. We constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $ and $ H_0 $ using the recent observational datasets: the Hubble dataset (OHD), the $ Pantheon $ dataset of $ 1048 $ points, and the joint dataset (OHD + $ Pantheon $). The universe model transitions from an early deceleration state to an acceleration in late times. This model also provides the ekpyrotic phase of the universe on the redshift $ z&gt;12.32 $. In this model, the Big Bang is described as a collision of branes, and thus, the Big Bang is not the beginning of time. Before the Big Bang, there is an ekpyrotic phase with the equation of state $ \omega &gt;&gt; 1 $. In late times, the undeviating Hubble measurements reduce the $ H_0 $ tension in the reconstructed $ f(Q, T) $ function. Additionally, we study various physical parameters of the model. Finally, our model describes a quintessence dark energy model at later times.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging of a Buchdahl dense core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging characteristics of a dense core modeled by the Buchdahl spacetime. By imposing the appropriate energy conditions and ensuring the absence of curvature singularities, we delineate the parameter space in which the dense core mimics key gravitational features of black holes while exhibiting unique deviations. We derive the photon orbital equation and calculate deflection angles, clearly distinguishing between weak- and strong-deflection regimes. Furthermore, we construct a mapping from the illuminated, geometrically thin accretion disk onto the observer's screen -- focusing on the isoradial curves corresponding to a representative source ring. For compactness values below a critical threshold, only a finite number of disk images are formed. In this range, their secondary and higher-order images typically display double-loop structures, with each loop individually capturing the entire source ring. Notably, the highest-order image sometimes appears as a single, crescent-shaped loop that does not enclose the screen's center, implying the existence of a cutoff angle that restricts the imaged portion of the source ring. In contrast, for compactness values above the critical threshold, an infinite sequence of double-loop structures appears -- a behavior closely linked to the presence of a photon sphere. These findings suggest that the lensing signatures of dense cores can distinguish them from black holes, offering new insights for high-resolution observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing attention has been recently devoted to the study of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime as a way to explore the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. In this work, we construct a Hamiltonian formulation for polar perturbations of this spacetime in the presence of a perturbative massless scalar field. Our analysis is based on a truncated action at quadratic order in perturbations. Both background and perturbative degrees of freedom are treated dynamically, forming a combined system that is endowed with the canonical structure obtained from our truncated action. First-order perturbations of the metric and the matter field are described using perturbative gauge invariants, linear perturbative constraints, and their corresponding canonical variables. For the quantum description, we adopt a hybrid approach where the background is quantized with loop quantum gravity techniques and the perturbations with conventional quantum field methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. Then by considering transition between discrete states of the event horizon area which in turn is equivalent to transitions between discrete mass states of the black hole, the change in the mass can be obtained. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states applying the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which is a charged black hole, and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry, and obtain the corrected Hawking temperature in each of these cases. We then take a step forward by inserting this corrected Hawking temperature in the first law of black hole thermodynamics once again to calculate the entropy of the black hole in terms of the horizon area of the black hole. This leads to logarithmic and inverse corrections to the entropy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Localization mechanism of $q-$form field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the scalar fields can be trapped on branes of different types, and the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the thick de Sitter brane, or the thick Minkowski brane via coupling with gravity. The Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the Minkowski brane and the thick de-Sitter brane, with certain couplings. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields in $D-$dimensional spacetime. Concrete $q-$form fields are discussed within five-dimensional brane models with typical spacetime geometries: Minkowski, de Sitter, and Anti-de Sitter. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero modes of various $q-$form fields can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the brane. Lastly in the Anti-de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the brane. For the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of these $q-$form fields, they could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane of different types. Besides, subtle and detailed behaviors of the Kaluza-Klein modes for $q-$form fields are observed: the zero modes could be localized on both sides of the brane, and the massive modes could be localized or quasi-localized at the brane position.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <title>The landscape of complexity measures in 2D gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the broad landscape of holographic complexity measures for theories dual to two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. Previous studies have largely focused on the complexity=volume and complexity=action proposals for holographic complexity. Here we systematically construct and analyze a wide class of generalized complexity functionals, focusing on codimension-one bulk observables. Two complementary approaches are presented: one inspired by dimensional reduction of codimension-one observables from higher-dimensional gravity, and another that adopts a purely 2D perspective. We verify the resulting observables exhibit hallmark features of complexity, such as linear growth at late times and the switchback effect. We further offer heuristic interpretations of the role of multiple extremal surfaces when they appear. Finally, we comment on the bulk-to-boundary dictionary via the covariant Peierls bracket in 2D gravity. Our work lays the groundwork for a richer understanding of quantum complexity in low-dimensional holographic dualities.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane model, the radion potential was fine-tuned to zero, leaving the extra-dimensional modulus undetermined. Goldberger and Wise (GW) introduced a stabilization mechanism by incorporating a massive bulk scalar field, leading to a radion potential with a stable minimum. In this work, we examine the impact of the intrinsic stability of the GW scalar field on the modulus stabilization procedure. To elucidate this relationship, we test the stabilization scheme across several relevant scenarios using methods of singular perturbation theory. Our analysis consistently indicates a one-to-one correspondence between the stability of the GW scalar and successful modulus stabilization. Additionally, we highlight that certain classes of GW bulk potentials demonstrate such a correspondence explicitly, and provide checks which any GW bulk potential must satisfy in order to ensure modulus stabilization.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Fast Higher-Order Interpolation and Restriction in ExaHyPE Avoiding Non-physical Reflections</title>

Abstract: Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict along resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla code version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a stationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved quantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order interpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid cell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster than the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary black hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR boundaries are removed.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>
