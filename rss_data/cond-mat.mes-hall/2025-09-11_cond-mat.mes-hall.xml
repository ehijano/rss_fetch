      <title>Reinterpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is a quantum mechanical effect for massless Dirac fermions in both particle physics and condensed matter physics. Here we present a set of effective models for single massless Dirac fermions in one- and three-dimensions in the whole Brillouin zone from higher-dimensional Chern insulators, which uniquely capture both the chiral fermion behavior near the Dirac point and high-energy states at Brillouin zone boundaries. In the presence of electromagnetic fields, the chiral coefficient $C_{5}$ is found to be chemical-potential dependent in general, but quantized precisely at the Fermi surface where chiral symmetry is preserved. This result provides an alternative interpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice: the anomaly is caused by the symmetry-broken states far below the Fermi surface, and protected by the local chiral symmetry. Our analysis here might provide a potential theoretical foundation for applying the concept of chiral anomaly in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Sb doping effect on transport behavior in the topological insulator Bi2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a good topological insulator (TI) with its surface band Dirac point inside the bulk bandgap. However, Bi2Se3 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) often require tuning of Fermi level near the Dirac point for optimal proximity effect with magnetic or superconducting materials. In this study, we achieve the control of the Fermi level in MBE-grown Bi2Se3 thin films by antimony (Sb) doping and systematically investigate the transport properties of these Bi2-xSbxSe3 films with different doping concentrations. Excellent topological surface conduction is attained, and weak antilocalization is observed in all Sb-doped Bi2Se3 films. While the carrier mobility shows no dependence on the Sb concentrations, indicating that the phonon scattering dominates over the impurity scattering from Sb dopants, the coherence length varies significantly with the Sb doping level at low temperatures (&lt; 30 K), highlighting the non-negligible electron-electron interactions in the low temperature regime. Furthermore, EuS/Bi2-xSbxSe3 heterostructures are fabricated to explore proximity-induced ferromagnetism in the TI surface states. However, the long-range magnetic order is not formed in the TI surface states under our growth conditions. Our results emphasize the critical role of interface quality for realizing exchange coupling. This work offers new insights into the interplay of disorder, decoherence, and scattering mechanisms in Sb-doped Bi2Se3 thin films, providing guidance for the future study of the proximity effect in heterostructures involving Sb-doped Bi2Se3.</description>

      <title>Impurity-Induced Interference at a Topological Boundary in an Infinite SSH Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the coupling between a strong impurity and the topological boundary of an SSH heterojunction, composed of two SSH chains belonging to different topological classes. We show that impurity boundary coupling gives rise to bonding and antibonding states within the SSH bulk gap. This coupling produces an interference effect in the local density of states, as the impurity approaches the boundary the LDOS evolves from a single sharp peak to a characteristic double peak structure. Moreover, the interference strength can be quantified by the decay length of the bonding or antibonding wavefunction and by the energy splitting of the LDOS resonance peaks near the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional materials as a multiproperty sensing platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have disrupted materials science due to the development of van der Waals technology. It enables the stacking of ultrathin layers of materials characterized by vastly different electronic structures to create man-made heterostructures and devices with rationally tailored properties, circumventing limitations of matching crystal structures, lattice constants, and geometry of constituent materials and supporting substrates. 2D materials exhibit extraordinary mechanical flexibility, strong light-matter interactions driven by their excitonic response, single photon emission from atomic centers, stable ferromagnetism in sub-nm thin films, fractional quantum Hall effect in high-quality devices, and chemoselectivity at ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratio. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures with atomically flat interfaces demonstrate an unprecedented degree of intertwined mechanical, chemical, optoelectronic, and magnetic properties. This constitutes a foundation for multiproperty sensing, based on complex intra- and intermaterial interactions, and a robust response to external stimuli originating from the environment. Here, we review recent progress in the development of sensing applications with 2D materials, highlighting the areas where van der Waals heterostructures offer the highest sensitivity, simultaneous responses to multiple distinct externalities due to their atomic thickness in conjunction with unique material combinations, and conceptually new sensing methodology.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium lifetimes of DNA under electronic current in a molecular junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</description>

      <title>Resonant current-in-plane spin-torque diode effect in magnet$-$normal metal bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field, which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.</description>

      <title>Probing up-conversion electroluminescence of decoupled porphyrin molecules in a plasmonic nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular triplet states can produce significant phosphorescence and act as a relay state for luminescence, such as in up-conversion processes. While this property makes triplet emitters interesting for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the study of their luminescence at the single molecule level in high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is challenging. We investigate individual Pd-octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP) molecules decoupled from Ag(100) and Ag(111) by an ultrathin NaCl layer and observe singlet and triplet emission lines at visible wavelengths, only about 100 nm apart from each other. This is in stark contrast to the metal or free-base phthalocyanines, for which typically the lowest triplet transitions lie in the far red or infrared where the sensitivity of CCD camera decreases significantly. The singlet S1 state of PdOEP emits photons even when the photon energy is higher than the energy provided by a tunneling electron, in an energy up-conversion process. This mechanism requires a relay (or shelving) state in which energy is stored in the molecule for the interval between tunneling electrons. Analyzing the energy levels of different molecular states (S1, D0, and T1 states) and fitting the current dependencies of S1 under up-conversion electroluminescence (UCEL) condition for S1 and T1 emission, we verify the validity of a triplet-mediated up-conversion model. We also discuss a preliminary result for coupling with a neighboring molecule.</description>

      <title>Observation of tunable chiral spin textures with nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical, and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.</description>

      <title>Quantized Charge Accumulation in a Quantum Anomalous Hall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of magnetic-field-induced quantized charge accumulation in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system -- a phenomenon originating from the intrinsic two-dimensional surface state and fundamentally distinct from conventional edge-dependent transport phenomena. Our approach employs a novel out-of-plane capacitive detection method to directly probe this charge accumulation, revealing its distinction and correlation with other surface state properties, such as Laughlin charge pumping. We demonstrate that the accumulated charge density is governed by the quantized Hall conductance but is significantly influenced by dissipation effects due to finite longitudinal conductance. By performing frequency and longitudinal conductance dependence measurements, the underlying ideal quantized charge accumulation is extracted, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Importantly, our out-of-plane method of measuring charge accumulation allows the detection of small electric polarization in future studies, establishing a pathway toward the direct observation of the topological magnetoelectric effect, a manifestation of the four-dimensional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Feynman paradox induced by vacuum and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charged particle initially at rest in an external magnetic field starts to rotate when the magnetic field is switched off. This is a variant of the Feynman disc paradox, where the conservation of angular momentum is seemingly violated. The paradox is understood by realizing that angular momentum is initially stored in the electromagnetic field and is transferred to the particle when the magnetic field is removed. In a classical description, no rotation occurs if the particle is uncharged, as the initial angular momentum is zero in this case. We show that electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal equilibrium can induce a quantum analog of the Feynman paradox, where a nonreciprocal particle without charge starts to rotate when the source of nonreciprocity is removed. This paradox is due to persistent energy fluxes arising in nonreciprocal systems at equilibrium, leading to angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that the contribution of vacuum fluctuations to persistent energy fluxes dominate over thermal fluctuations at finite temperature, so vacuum fluctuations dominate the equilibrium angular momentum as well. Observation of the induced motion would thus provide a means of detecting persistent energy fluxes and offer further evidence for the physical reality of vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Cat states in one- and two-mode $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-mode variants of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric quantum Rabi model, which describe the interaction of a qutrit with one or two bosonic modes and are directly relevant for circuit-QED and spin-qudit platforms. We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Signatures of exceptional points in multiterminal superconductor-normal metal junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points leave signatures visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards a $\cos(2\varphi)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport in two-dimensional interacting massless-massive fermion mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the massive holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to an external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field--dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and massless Dirac particles for the magnetoconductivity and resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4\ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for short-range interhole interaction potential, and $T^2$-like behavior in case of long-range interhole interaction potential. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. In contrast to this, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $\sim T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2\ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction. A classically strong magnetic field suppresses the interaction-induced corrections to magnetoresistivity of massless-massive hole gas mixture.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. Numerical simulations thoroughly validate this exact solution. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the \emph{impurity-induced counter skin-effect}. These findings offer insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. We propose a possible implementation of this system for a non-Hermitian discrete-time quantum walk, and we demonstrate that an impurity-induced counter skin-effect also exists in multi-band models.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Observation of average topological phase in disordered Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting waveguides with 104-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies as a function of temperature and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</description>
