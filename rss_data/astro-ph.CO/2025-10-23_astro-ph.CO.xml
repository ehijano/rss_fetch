      <title>The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power -- up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.761\pm 0.045$ and $S_8 = 0.794\pm 0.040$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k &gt; \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension in an anisotropic Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Hubble tension within an anisotropic cosmological framework by revisiting the Bianchi type-I model introduced in Le Delliou et al. 2020. Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.</description>

      <title>$H_0$ Without the Sound Horizon (or Supernovae): A 2% Measurement in DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound horizon scale $r_s$ is a key source of information for early-time $H_0$ measurements, and is therefore a common target of new physics proposed to solve the Hubble tension. We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.</description>

      <title>BaryonBridge: Stochastic Interpolant Model for Fast Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a general-purpose framework for mapping between dark matter simulations and observable hydrodynamical simulation outputs is a long-standing problem in modern astrophysics. In this work, we present a new approach utilizing stochastic interpolants to map between cheap fast particle mesh simulations and baryonic quantities in three dimensions, requiring a total of 7 GPU minutes per 256^3 grid size simulation. Using the CAMELS multifield dataset, we are able to condition our mapping on both cosmological and astrophysical properties. We focus this work on hydrodynamical quantities suitable for Lya observables finding excellent agreement up to small spatial scales, k ~ 10.0 (h^(-1) Mpc) at z=2.0, for Lya flux statistics. Our approach is fully convolutional, allowing training on comparatively small volumes and application to larger volumes, which was tested on TNG50.</description>

      <title>Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Standard Model equation of state and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Population III.1 Flash Reionization for CMB Polarization and Thomson Scattering Optical Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Population III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts a very early ($z\sim20-25$), transient phase, ``The Flash'', of cosmic reionization powered by supermassive stars that are SMBH progenitors. The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\tau\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several ``tensions'' faced by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\tau$, while the power at $l\gtrsim8$ is boosted. Thus the Pop III.1 reionization scenario provides a natural way to increase $\tau$, while remaining closer to the latest CMB low-$l$ polarization observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational lensing by matter currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>The richest clusters in the Coma and Leo superclusters: Properties and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the substructure, connectivity, and galaxy content of galaxy clusters A1656 and 1367 in the Coma supercluster and of A1185 in the Leo supercluster with the aim of understanding the evolution of clusters from turnaround to virialisation. We used data from the SDSS DR10 MAIN galaxy sample and from DESI cluster catalogues. The projected phase space diagram and the distribution of mass were used to identify regions of various infall stages (early and late infall, and regions of ongoing infall, i.e. regions of influence), their characteristic radii, embedded mass, and density contrasts in order to study the evolution of clusters with the spherical collapse model. We determined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and their connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster's regions of influence, analysed galaxy content of clusters, and derived scaling relations between cluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five components and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of influence are $R_\mathrm{inf} \approx 4$ Mpc, and the density contrast at their borders is $\Delta\rho_{inf} \approx 50 - 60$. The scaling relations between the masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the clusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In superclusters the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in low-density regions between superclusters. The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts $z \approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will be virialised in $\approx 3.3$ Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in $\approx 10$ Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Very High Precision Astrometry for Exoplanets and Dark Matter with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.</description>

      <title>Axion Production and Detection Using a Dual NMR-type Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions that couple to nuclear spins via the axial current interaction can be both produced and detected using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In this scheme, nuclei driven by a real oscillating magnetic field in one device act as an axion source, which can drive NMR in a nearby spin-polarized sample interrogated with a sensitive magnetometer. We study the prospects for detecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that result in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the generated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the source. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric size. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known frequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency, enabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of a pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time can already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon coupling. A similar sensitivity can be achieved with 10 centimeter-scale NMR devices with only 1 hour of integration time. These dual NMR configurations are capable of probing a wide range of axion masses, up to values comparable to the inverse distance between the source and the sensor.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles ($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} &gt; 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$ properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution of the gauge-mediation type Q ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the formation of the gauge-mediation type Q balls in the logarithmic square potential on three-dimensional lattices. We obtain the broad charge distribution of the Q ball of this type for the first time. The charge of the Q ball at the peak of the distribution is smaller than what we estimated as the average of the largest tens of the Q balls in the logarithmic potential for the same initial amplitude of the field at the onset of its oscillation. We also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls. We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by them. On the other hand, the large L balls (Q being the lepton number) would be the dark matter as well while avoiding the constraints on the X and/or gamma rays from the decay of the smaller L balls.</description>

      <title>Implications of $f(R)$ gravity on late-time cosmic structure growth through a complete description of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of $\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the quasistatic approximation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dynamical Capture on two equal-mass non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Growth in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.</description>

      <title>TOPz: Photometric redshifts using template fitting applied to the GAMA survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Accurate photometric redshift estimation is crucial for cosmological and galaxy evolution studies, especially with the advent of large-scale photometric surveys.
  Aims. We developed a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory Photo-z) and applied it to the GAMA photometric catalogue. Using nine-band photometric data from the GAMA project, we assessed the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z estimates to available spectroscopic redshifts from GAMA and DESI. The latter extends to z &lt; 2 and m_Z &lt; 24, allowing the photo-z accuracy to be validated beyond the GAMA limits.
  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate photo-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. We generated synthetic galaxy spectra using the CIGALE software and ran template set optimisation. We improved the photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical prior was then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift estimates.
  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the spectroscopic redshifts in the low-redshift regime (z &lt; 0.5). We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various magnitude bins and tested how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the actual uncertainty of the estimates. For the GAMA sample, the sigma_NMAD = 0.012 for m_Z &lt;18 and increases to sigma_NMAD = 0.021 for m_Z &gt;19. The outlier fraction (|dz|/(1 + z)&gt;0.1) in the same magnitude bins increases from 1% to 5%. We show that the TOPz results are consistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes (EAZY and SFM) applied to the same data set.
  Conclusions. TOPz is an advanced photo-z estimation code that integrates flux corrections, physical priors, and template set optimisation to provide state-of-the-art photo-z among competing template-based redshift estimators.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, although more work must be done to explore how high mass ratio PBH binaries actually evolve.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-Universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wavenumber of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center, and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Our work thus reveals effects that must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.</description>

      <title>New Radio Data on Sources of the Big Trio Program for Searching for Distant Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio sources with steep and ultra-steep spectra, identified through a series of surveys of the Cold experiment using the RATAN-600 radio telescope, formed the basis of the Big Trio program aimed at discovering distant radio galaxies. With the advent of new radio, optical, and infrared sky surveys, it became possible to carry out additional studies of the 113 radio sources observed within this program using the 6-meter BTA telescope.
  Morphological features indicative of the evolutionary state of radio sources revealed that 9 objects exhibit signs of restarted activity, 12 can be classified as young, and 2 as dying. Based on their WAT/NAT and WRS morphologies, 24 sources are likely located within galaxy groups or clusters, or show evidence of jet reorientation. Additionally, four objects in the sample represent pairs of radio sources whose host galaxies are separated by only a few tens of kiloparsecs.
  Continuum spectra were constructed, and variability indices were calculated. A high proportion of sources with a variability index ($V&gt;3$) is attributed to significant differences in angular resolution between the TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as to underestimated flux densities for certain double-lobed sources.
  A comparison of spectral indices derived from older and newer data indicates a decrease in the number of steep-spectrum sources in the sample. This reduction is most likely due to improved characterization of the low-frequency portion of the continuum spectra following the incorporation of GLEAM data. However, for some radio sources, the observed spectral changes may reflect internal evolution, that observed in a shift of the spectral peak or a roll-off in the radio spectrum towards lower frequencies, as evidenced by flux density measurements from various catalogues covering a period of up to forty years.</description>

      <title>Clustering of DESI galaxies split by thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.</description>

ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit} (https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit).</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python package https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit.</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>A smooth filament origin for distant prolate galaxies seen by JWST and HST</title>

Abstract: The initial gravitational collapse of Dark Matter and gas forms a universal filamentary network where the first galaxies form, with shapes and sizes that depend on the choice of Dark Matter. Claims from deep space imaging surveys that elongated galaxies predominate at $z &gt; 3$ are examined here by comparison with detailed hydrodynamical simulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Warm Dark Matter (WDM), and Wave/Fuzzy Dark Matter, $\psi$DM. For CDM and WDM we have sufficient volume, $10^{3}\,\mathrm{Mpc/h}^{3}$, to generate galaxies with stellar masses $&gt; 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 2$, allowing comparison with the CEERS and CANDELS surveys. We find the observed tendency towards elongated, prolate-shaped young galaxies is well matched by WDM, from material accreted along smooth filaments during the first $\simeq 500\,\mathrm{Myr}$, with little dependence on stellar mass. This contrasts with CDM, where the stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal, formed from merging of fragmented filaments. For CDM, several subhalos are predicted to be visible, whereas for WDM and $\psi$DM, early merging is rare. Our findings show how the shapes and sizes of early galaxies are sensitive to the smoothness of the underlying filament network, providing a new constraint on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gravitational constant at low energies from the connection between spin-2 and spin-0 sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fact that graviton propagator contains not only one but two tensorial components excludes a unique definition of the running behavior of the gravitational constant, while at low energies gravitation is characterized solely by Newton's constant. How these two facts are reconciled when massive quantum fields are present remains unanswered. In this work, by non-minimally coupling gravity to a one-loop massive scalar, we show that this potential conflict is resolved by the non-trivial equivalence between the residues of the two propagator components. Such equivalence, crucial for the validity of the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, is based on a rather subtle connection between the spin-2 and spin-0 sectors of the propagator. It is verified that this connection also makes the two quantum-corrected gravitational potentials be characterized by the same gravitational constant at large distances. In addition, we find that the potentials in our case as well as the quantum-corrected Coulomb potential can be expressed concisely in a unified formulation. By comparing these results with experiments, we establish a new upper bound on the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Naturally resonant two-mediator model of self-interacting dark matter with decoupled relic abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, fully thermal mechanism that resolves the long-standing tension between achieving the observed dark-matter relic abundance and explaining the astrophysical signatures of self-interactions. The framework introduces two mediators: a light scalar $\phi$ (MeV scale) that yields the required, velocity-dependent self-interactions, and a heavy scalar resonance $\Phi_h$ (TeV scale) with mass $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ that opens an $s$-channel resonant annihilation during freeze-out. This clearly decouples early-universe annihilation from late-time halo dynamics. A detailed numerical analysis identified a narrow predictive island of viability. A representative benchmark with $m_\chi\!=\!600$~GeV, $m_\phi\!=\!15$~MeV, and $m_{\Phi_h}\!\simeq\!1.2$~TeV reproduces the relic density and yields $\sigma_T/m_\chi\sim 0.1$--$1~\mathrm{cm}^2\!/\mathrm{g}$ at dwarf-galaxy velocities while satisfying cluster bounds. The model makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow $t\bar t$ resonance near $1.2$~TeV within HL-LHC reach, and a spin-independent direct-detection signal $\sigma_{\rm SI}\!\sim\!7\times10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$ within next-generation sensitivity. As an optional UV completion, we show that walking $\mathrm{SU}(3)_H$ gauge theory with $N_f=10$ naturally realizes the near-threshold relation $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ and can furnish an effective anomalous dimension $\gamma\!\approx\!0.5$ which underlies a density-responsive dark-energy sector, suggesting a unified origin for the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Strings in $E_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.</description>
