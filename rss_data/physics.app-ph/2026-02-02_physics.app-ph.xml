      <title>A centimeter-sized gas pressure sensor for high-vacuum measurements at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas pressure sensors based on nanomechanical membranes have recently demonstrated an ultra-wide ten-decade measurement range, a gas-type-independent response, and a self-calibrating operation with uncertainties of approximately $1\,\%$. The readout relied on tabletop free-space laser interferometers. Here we present a centimeter-sized, portable implementation in which a square Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane is read out via a fiber-based laser interferometer. We perform pressure measurements between $5\times10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1}$~mbar in a confined $0.7$~L volume cooled to $78$~K. Because no suitable commercial pressure sensor exists for direct cryogenic comparison, we benchmark our device against room-temperature commercial gauges connected to the cold volume through a pipe of limited conductance. The measured relationship between the two sensors is compared with models accounting for temperature- and pumping-induced pressure gradients within the measurement chamber. These models agree with the measurements to within $&lt;10\,\%$ for helium and $&lt;13\,\%$ for nitrogen. The achieved readout sensitivity of $S_x = 8\times10^{-14}\,\mathrm{m}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ theoretically enables resolving the thermal displacement noise spectrum of a trampoline membrane at atmospheric pressure, with a peak response of $48\,S_x$ $\left(25\,S_x\right)$ at $295\,\mathrm{K}$ $\left(78\,\mathrm{K}\right)$. Our results suggest that the previously achieved pressure measurement range of ten decades with trampoline membranes is compatible with fiber-based optical readout. This paves the way for widely applicable pressure sensors in the centimeter size range in cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>A combined criterion of surface free energy and roughness to predict the wettability of non-ideal low-energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of wettability between solid and liquid substances in different fields encourages scientists to develop accurate models to estimate the resultant apparent contact angles. Surface free energy (SFE), which is principally defined for ideal (flat) surfaces, is not applicable to predict the wettability of real (rough) surfaces. This paper introduces a new parameter, namely normalized surface free energy (NSFE) as a combination of SFE and roughness, to predict the contact angle of liquids on non-ideal low-energy surfaces. The remarkable consistency of the predicted and measured contact angles of liquids on some rough surfaces also confirm the validity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Time-domain optical coherence tomography at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ using GaSb-based broadband superluminescent diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a time-domain optical coherence tomography (TD-OCT) system operating in the 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ spectral region, enabled by a GaSb-based superluminescent diode (SLD). The spectrum emitted by the SLD exhibits a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$80 nm centred near 2.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. For OCT operation, stable amplified spontaneous emission with low spectral ripple ($&lt;20\%$) is maintained at drive currents below 150 mA. The SLD is fiber coupled and integrated into a fiber-based Michelson interferometer. In the OCT system, the measured coherence envelope yields an axial resolution of approximately 300 $\mu$m in air and enables depth-resolved imaging of scattering paint-based coating samples. In contrast to OCT implementations at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength region that commonly rely on supercontinuum sources, the use of GaSb-based SLDs offers a compact practical alternative, leveraging the maturity and scalability of electrically driven semiconductor light sources packaged in a standard "butterfly" module. This report represents the first demonstration of TD-OCT imaging at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ using a GaSb-based SLD source and establishes its suitability for compact and scalable mid-IR OCT instrumentation targeting non-biological, low-water-content materials.</description>

      <title>Rotating Magnetocaloric Effect in Sintered La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$H$_z$ Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La-Fe-Si-based alloys are among the most application-ready magnetocaloric materials for room-temperature magnetic refrigeration. Powder metallurgy methods have been previously demonstrated to successfully produce structures with sub-mm features for magnetic refrigerators in a scalable method. In this work, we explore the rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) present in a 0.27 mm thin plate of sintered and hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$. The high aspect ratio ($\sim$50) of the thin plate leads to an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE), dependent on the relative orientation of the external magnetic field, and an RMCE when the external field is rotated. We find a maximum rotating adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) of 1.17 K with the rotation of a 1 T magnetic field and 1.12 K when rotating a 0.6 T magnetic field, a reduction of only 4% for a 40% reduction in applied field strength. Magnetostatic computations revealed a considerable rotating isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_{iso}^{rot}$), comparable to the conventional MCE of Gd for similar fields, reaching 3.97 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 1 T and 3.68 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 0.6 T (7% reduction), highlighting La-Fe-Mn-Si alloys as high potential candidates for a magnetic refrigerator based on the RMCE utilizing relatively low external magnetic field amplitudes, such as 0.6 T.</description>

      <title>Missing links prediction: comparing machine learning with physics-rooted approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An active research line within the broader field of network science is the one concerning link prediction. Close in scope to network reconstruction, link prediction targets specific connections with the aim of uncovering the missing ones, as well as predicting those most likely to emerge in the future, from the available information. In this paper, we consider two families of methods, i.e. those rooted in statistical physics and those based upon machine learning: the members of the first family identify missing links as the most probable non-observed ones, the probability coefficients being determined by solving maximum-entropy benchmarks over the accessible network structure; the members of the second family, instead, associate the presence of single edges to explanatory node-specific variables. Running likelihood-based models such as the Configuration Model, or one of its many fitness-based variants, in parallel with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm reveals that the former's accuracy is comparable to (and sometimes slightly higher than) the latter's. Such a result confirms that white-box algorithms are viable competitors to the currently available black-box ones, being computationally faster and more interpretable than the latter.</description>

      <title>Loop-gap resonators achieving strong magnon-photon coupling in magnetic insulator thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon-photon hybrid systems consisting of a three-dimensional electromagnetic resonator and a bulk magnetic insulator constitute the standard experimental platform in cavity magnonics. Here, we demonstrate a modular loop-gap resonator design optimized to couple with thin films of magnetic insulators. We achieve the strong-coupling regime using this loop-gap resonator coupled to a 75~nm-thick epitaxial film of yttrium iron garnet at room temperature. We further show how to perform field-differential spectroscopy of the hybrid magnon-photon system, which eliminates the unwanted signal from other loop-gap modes uncoupled to the magnetic film. In addition to the uniform ferromagnetic resonance mode, the loop-gap resonator enables an hybridization with the standing spin-wave modes forming across the thickness of the film. Our approach unlocks the use of epitaxial films and multilayers of magnetic insulators to tune the magnon band structure in cavity magnonics experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Hexagonal Nanowire MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cell with Broadband Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as strong contenders for the next generation of photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their exceptional light absorption properties, tunability, and affordability in manufacturing. Here, we presented an ingenious hexagonal nanowire (HNW)-based PSC that achieves broadband absorption, minimizes reflectance, and offers robust polarization insensitivity by improving light-matter interaction and increasing charge-collection efficiency. The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Purcell effect can lead to a substantial enhancement in the maximum cooling power for solid-state laser cooling. We numerically demonstrate such enhancement in a patterned slot-waveguide structure using ytterbium-doped silica as the active material. The enhancement arises primarily from the increase of saturation power density and the escape efficiency, and can persist in spite of the presence of parasitic absorption in the structure surrounding the active material. Our results point to a new opportunity in photonic structure design for optical refrigeration.</description>
