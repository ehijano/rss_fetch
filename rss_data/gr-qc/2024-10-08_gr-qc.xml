      <title>Nonmetric geometric flows and quasicrystalline topological phases for dark energy and dark matter in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on nonmetric geometric flow theory and metric-affine gravity with applications in modern cosmology. Two main motivations for our research follow from the facts that 1) cosmological models for $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, MGTs, are efficient for describing recent observational data provided by the James Webb Space Telescope; and 2) the statistical thermodynamic properties of such nonmetric locally anisotropic cosmological models can be studied using generalizations of the concept of G. Perelman entropy. We derive nonmetric distorted R. Hamilton and Ricci soliton equations in such canonical nonholonomic variables when corresponding systems of nonlinear PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general off-diagonal forms. This is possible if we develop and apply the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method involving corresponding types of generating functions and generating sources encoding nonmetric distortions. Using such generic off-diagonal solutions (when the coefficients of metrics and connections may depend generically on all spacetime coordinates), we model accelerating cosmological scenarios with quasi-periodic gravitational and (effective) matter fields; and study topological and nonlinear geometric properties of respective dark energy and dark matter, DE and DM, models. As explicit examples, we analyze some classes of nonlinear symmetries defining topological quasicrystal, QC, phases which can modified to generate other types of quasi-periodic and locally anisotropic structures. The conditions when such nonlinear systems possess a behaviour which is similar to that of the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario are stated. We conclude that nonmetric geometric and cosmological flows can be considered as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM concordance models and speculate on how such theories can be elaborated.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and Global Properties of the Liouville Solution in General Relativity with a Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One parameter family of exact solutions in general relativity with a scalar field has been found using the Liouville metric. The scalar field potential is exponential and bounded from below. This model is interesting because, in particular, the solution corresponding to the naked singularity provides smooth extension of the Friedmann universe with accelerated expansion through the zero of the scale factor back in time. There is also nonstatic solution describing a black hole formation. All geodesics are found explicitly. Their analysis shows that the Liouville solutions are global ones: every geodesic is either continued to infinite value of the canonical parameter in both directions or ends up at the singularity at its finite value.</description>

      <title>Wave optics for rotating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing in wave optics is a rich field combining caustic singularities, general relativity and interference phenomena. We present a detailed evaluation of wave optics effects resulting from the frame-dragging of a rotating star modeled by a Lense-Thirring spacetime. We demonstrate that, contrary to what was previously stated in the literature, the spin of the star leaves an intricate imprint on the interference fringes and the caustics of the lensed source. This interference pattern can in principle be used to directly measure the spin of the lens.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation~($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity~($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in a Perturbative Bianchi I Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is straightforward to take the gravitational wave solution to first order in $v/c$ far from a binary source in a Minkowski background and adapt it to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, representing an expanding isotropic homogeneous universe. We find the analogous solution for a slightly anisotropic background, which may be a more accurate description of our universe, and we use a perturbative form of the Bianchi I metric and demonstrate how the waveform differs. Using supernova anisotropy data as a reference, we show that the assumption of a Bianchi I background could imply a 3.2\% difference in inferred luminosity distance compared to what would be inferred under the assumption of the FLRW background. Therefore, the background spacetime used for the inference of the Hubble parameter from gravitational wave data should be considered carefully.</description>

      <title>Classification of the non-null electrovacuum solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations with three-parameter abelian group of motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of the Stackel spaces of the electrovacuum of the type (3.0) has been done. These spaces are invariant under the action of the three-parameter abelian group of motions and belong to the first type Bianchi spaces. In the case of a non-zero cosmological term, the metrics and potentials contain solutions of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of the second order. When the cosmological term equals zero, the metrics and the components of the electromagnetic field tensor are expressed through elementary functions. Thus the classification of the electrovacuum Stackel spaces of all types is completed and complete list of these spaces is constructed.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Scenario in the $f(T)$ Modified Gravity Model with Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $f(T)$ gravity, the theory modifies the gravitational action by introducing a function of the torsion scalar $T$. This approach allows for a different treatment of gravity than general relativity, particularly in cosmological contexts. Dynamical system analysis is a powerful tool for exploring the stability and behavior of cosmological solutions within this framework. The dynamical system analysis involves examining the phase space of the cosmological equations derived from the $f(T)$ model. This analysis helps identify fixed points, stability, and the evolution of the universe's scale factor. Therefore, in the following, we first review the main equations of the $f(T)$ gravity model. Then we study the dynamic analysis of the gravity model and obtain stability points. Finally, we consider the bouncing scenario in this model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a newly constructed black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper finds an exact singular black hole solution in the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics as the source of matter field surrounded by a cloud of strings in $4D$ $AdS$ spacetime. Here, the presence of the cloud of string, the usual Bardeen solution, becomes singular. The obtained black hole solution interpolates with the $AdS$ Letelier black hole in the absence of both the deviation parameter and magnetic charge and interpolates with the $AdS$ Bardeen black hole in the absence of the deviation parameter and a cloud of strings parameter. We analyse the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, including the stability of the resulting black hole, numerically and graphically. Thermodynamical quantities associated with the black hole get modified due to the nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings. Moreover, we study the effect of a cloud of strings parameter, magnetic charge and deviation parameter on critical points and phase transition of the obtained black hole where the cosmological constant is treated as the thermodynamics pressure. The critical radius increases with increasing deviation parameter values and magnetic charge values. In contrast, the critical pressure and temperature decrease with increasing deviation parameters and magnetic charge values.</description>

      <title>Einstein Cluster as Central Spiky Distribution of Galactic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Einstein cluster models, we construct a fully relativistic, spherically symmetric, spiky structure of matter distribution near a supermassive black hole. We introduce and discuss three simple toy models, together with a more realistic model, which includes a Hernquist-type distribution with a typical galaxy scale. We find that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depends on the details of the environment, and lies between the photon radius (at $3M_{\rm BH}$) and the ISCO radius of an isolated black hole of mass $M_{\rm BH}$ (at $6M_{\rm BH}$).</description>

      <title>On the Interrelation of the Generalized Holographic Equipartition and Entropy Maximization in Kaniadakis Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the compatibility of the generalized holographic equipartition proposed in ref \cite{sheykhi2013friedmann} with the maximization of horizon entropy in an (n + 1)-dimensional non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. Here, the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is described by Kaniadakis entropy, as well as truncated Kaniadakis entropy, which is expanded and truncated to third order when the Kaniadakis parameter $(K)$ is small, indicating minor deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Initially, we derive the conditions required for maximizing both Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We then examine whether the generalized holographic equipartition aligns with the constraints of horizon entropy maximization. Our findings reveal that the generalized holographic equipartition is consistent with the maximization of Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy in a universe with non-zero spatial curvature.</description>

      <title>Effect of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity on the properties of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate strange quark stars within the framework of modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically defined as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\chi T $. The equation of state is obtained with the different forms of the MIT bag model and quark mass model with medium effects and self-consistent thermodynamical treatment. We find that negative values of $\chi$ significantly increase both the mass and radius of the quark star. The inclusion of $\chi$ helps to satisfy recent the astrophysical constraints on the mass-radius relationship. We have also constrained the values of $\chi$ for each EoS, based on the observed maximum mass and corresponding radius, demonstrating that the inclusion of this parameter helps to address the challenges posed by both the GW190814 event and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451. We also observe that the inclusion of $f(R,T)$ gravity leads to an increase in both the maximum mass, by about $ (0.23- 0.27)~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radius, by approximately (1.5-2.0)~\text{km}, depending on the chosen equation of state.</description>

      <title>Analytical QNMs of fields of various spin in the Hayward spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing an expansion in terms of the inverse multipole number, we derive analytic expressions for the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, Dirac, and Maxwell perturbations in the Hayward black hole (BH) background. The metric has three interpretations: as a model for a radiating BH, as a quantum-corrected BH owing to the running gravitational coupling in the Asymptotically Safe Gravity, and as a BH solution in the Effective Field Theory. We show that the obtained compact analytical formulas approximate QNMs with remarkable accuracy for $\ell &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>The precession of particle spin in spherical symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will explore the precession of particle spins in spherical spacetimes. We first argue that the geometrical optics (WKB) approximation is insufficient, due to the absence of a glory spot in the backward scattering of massless particles, making an analysis of spin precession necessary. We then derive the precession equation assuming the spin is parallel transported, which is supported by the sub-leading order of the WKB approximation. The precession equation applies to both massless and massive particles. For particles with speed $v=1$, we show that spin is always reversed after backward scattering in any spherically symmetric spacetime, confirming the absence of a glory spot for massless particles. Finally, we solve the precession equation for Schwarzschild and \acrlong{rn} spacetimes and discuss the spin precession of massive particles, particularly in the non-relativistic limit. We find that, in Schwarzschild spacetime, the spin precession for particles with $v\approx0$ depends only on the deflection angle, while in \acrlong{rn} spacetime, it also depends on the black hole charge, as revealed by the expansion derived from the strong lensing approximation.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we propose a novel method for space-based OLC detectors that can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by utilizing the cross-correlation between two of them. This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Our results indicate that the cross-correlation technique can improve the sensitivity by approximately an order of magnitude compared to a single OLC detector configuration, and even would surpass current detection systems such as LISA in the full-band detection capability of SGWB.</description>

      <title>On the transverse-traceless gauge condition when matters are presented</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-traceless gauge condition is an important concept in the theory of gravitational wave. It is well known that vacuum is one of the key conditions to guarantee the existence of the transverse-traceless gauge. Although it is thin, interstellar medium is ubiquitous in the universe. Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of gravitational wave when matter is presented. Bondi-Metzner-Sachs theory has solved the gauge problem related to gravitational wave. But it does not help with the cases when gravitational wave propagates in matters. This paper discusses possible extensions of the transverse-traceless gauge condition to Minkowski perturbation with matter presented.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>

      <title>Euclidean actions and static black hole entropy in teleparallel theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the results by Bekenstein, Gibbons and Hawking on the thermodynamics of black holes can be reproduced quite simply in the Euclidean path integral approach to Quantum Gravity. The corresponding partition function is obtained semiclassically, ultimately requiring only the on-shell Einstein-Hilbert action with opportune asymptotic subtractions. We elaborate on the fact that the same expressions for the thermodynamical quantities can be obtained within teleparallel equivalent theories, based on either torsion or nonmetricity, by employing quasilocal relations. Notably, the bulk integrals of these theories do not vanish on-shell but rather result in boundary terms themselves. Asymptotic subtractions of the latter are able to cancel out the divergences, ultimately leading to Bekenstein-Gibbons-Hawking's results. As a non-trivial cross-check, we compute the bulk integrals directly without reference to the boundary terms. While the result agrees with the previous method for the torsion-based teleparallel theory, it differs for the nonmetricity theory. Specifically, upon regularizing the bulk integral using a fiducial reference frame, we find that the semiclassical partition function vanishes. To address this problem, we propose a simple prescription for Schwarzschild black holes, which involves keeping the nonmetric connection arbitrary and imposing thermal equilibrium. Generalizations of the results to more general modified gravity theories with antisymmetric degrees of freedom are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Static, spherically symmetric solutions in $f(Q)$-gravity and in nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the gravitational field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within the framework of the symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive new solutions within the context of power-law $f(Q)$ gravity and the nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory. For the connection in the non-coincidence gauge, we present the point-like Lagrangian that describes the employed field equations. Furthermore, we construct two conservation laws, and for different values of these conserved quantities, we analytically solve the gravitational field equations. New solutions are obtained, we investigate their physical properties and their general relativistic limit. Finally, we discuss the algebraic properties for the derived spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Evolving wormhole formation in dRGT massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have examined the evolving wormhole solution within Einstein-massive gravity, considering traceless, barotropic, and anisotropic pressure fluids. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the constraints imposed by the constants derived from the wormhole solution. It is found that the wormhole throat, situated between two asymptotic universes, undergoes simultaneous expansion with acceleration. A detailed investigation of the energy conditions for traceless, barotropic, and anisotropic fluids suggests a wide range of possibilities for evolving wormhole configurations with non-exotic matter at the throat. The dependency of this feature on the various parameters arising from the study has also been examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General theory of relativity is non--linear in nature and therefore can result in hysteresis--like effects and cause systems to remember the footprint of the gravitational field. Here we have investigated this effect using the Kinetic theory in curved spacetime. It is shown that entropy rate experiences this hysteresis behavior. Then, the effect is considered for some special cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Analysis of Gravitational Waves via Numerical Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitons are understood to be the quantum noise of gravitational waves and between two gravitational masses. Supposing a coalescing binary resembles a rotating and contracting volume, the gravitons in an effective thermal gas undergo Brownian motion via interactions with their nearest neighbors. The Einstein-Langevin equation expresses first-order metric pertubations as gravitonic fluctuations; conditioning the equation for a coalescing binary allows a concrete evaluation of quanta dissipation as directly proportional to the third power of osculating eccentricity and inversely proportional to the volume. In addition, conducting Gaussian noise analysis on the conditioned Einstein-Langevin equation via an Euler iteration scheme achieves a simulation of the Brownian motion of gravitons. The produced noise signal from a graviton's Brownian motion closely resembles a GW waveform. "Wolfram Mathematica" coding commands are offered in-text for the reproduction of numerical results.</description>

      <title>Frozen gravitational stars in Einsteinian cubic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the numerical solutions for spherically symmetric situations in Einstein cubic gravity. In addition to the previously found black hole solutions, we uncover a new class of solutions that lack horizons. Due to the divergence of the central curvature, these solutions represent a novel type of naked singularity. By varying parameters, we find that under certain conditions, the metric function can approach zero infinitely, indicating the emergence of a critical event horizon. These solutions, featuring a critical horizon and obtained solely from pure gravity model, can be described as frozen gravitational stars (FGSs). Additionally, the radius of this horizon is linked to the coupling constant lambda, increasing as lambda increases. Remarkably, from the perspective of an external observer, these solutions closely resemble extreme black holes. Notably, we find that for all values of lambda, the position of this critical horizon coincides with that of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the general solution to the coupled Einstein and Dirac field equations in static and hyperplane-symmetric spacetime of arbitrary dimension including a cosmological constant of either sign. As a result, only a massful Dirac field couples via the Einstein equations to spacetime, and in the massless case the Dirac field is required to fulfill appropriate constraints in order to eliminate off-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor. We also give explicit expressions for curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann scalar, indicating physical singularities. Moreover, we reduce the general solution of the geodesic equation to quadratures.</description>

      <title>Matter--Geometry interplay in new scalar tensor theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy--momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the $f(R, G_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson--Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine--tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.</description>

      <title>Early Universe Cosmology with Coherent state as an Initial Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are going to study the quantum mechanical properties of primordial perturbations generated during inflation. Instead of choosing Bunch-Davies vacuum, we are going to prescribe the Coherent state as a non-trivial choice for the initial state of cosmological perturbations. Then we are trying to investigate its implications on the CMB map through the determination of its Correlation function, Covariance matrix and Power spectrum. Also we discuss something regarding the homogeneous and isotropic distribution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable over cosmological background. After that we will study the behaviour of Entanglement entropy and Bell inequality violation in the context of Squeezed coherent state, a cosmological time-evolved version of Coherent state. From this investigation, we will show that it is possible to distinguish the initial state of cosmological perturbations through the determination of Bell inequality. Apart from this, we also investigate whether it is possible to find any kind of squeezing for our non-trivial choice of Coherent state. Lastly we conclude this article by discussing some of the implications that arise solely due to our initially prescribed Coherent state.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Quantization of a Nonminimal Coupling Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper we studied the cosmology of Nonminimal Derivative Coupling (NDC) between gravity and a scalar field, which is a non-trivial class of Horndeski. We have shown that it presents a variety of solutions for the scale factor, but there are gravitational waves only for a very restrictive range in phase space, and primordial waves are completely forbidden classically in NDC. In this paper, we apply canonical quantization with the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation to that theory for a small value of the nonminimal coupling constant. We then study two quantum solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that lead to the perturbation of bouncing and cyclic solutions. By the analysis of the phase space obtained from the guidance equations of Bohm-de Broglie, we study the phase space determined by the scale factor and the scalar field for those quantum solutions in order to investigate three main aspects of that theory: the existence of non-singular solutions, the regions of accelerated expansion, and the regions compatible with the gravitational waves speed constraint. We conclude that there are non-singular solutions with an accelerated expansion period compatible with the constraint.</description>

      <title>Exponentially-growing Mode Instability on Reissner-Nordstr\"om--Anti-de-Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct growing mode solutions to the uncharged and charged Klein-Gordon equations on the sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om--anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime under reflecting (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary conditions. Our result applies to a range of Klein-Gordon masses above the so-called Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, notably including the conformal mass case. The mode instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om--AdS spacetime for some black hole parameters is in sharp contrast to the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime, where the solution to the Klein-Gordon equation is known to decay in time. Contrary to other mode instability results on the Kerr and Kerr-AdS spacetimes, our growing mode solutions of the uncharged and weakly charged Klein-Gordon equation exist independently of the occurrence or absence of superradiance. We discover a novel mechanism leading to a growing mode solution, namely, a near-extremal instability for the Klein-Gordon equation. Our result seems to be the first rigorous mathematical realization of this instability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spherically Symmetric Hairy Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter families of static spherically symmetric asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solutions $(\mathcal{M},g_{\epsilon},\phi_{\epsilon})$ to the Einstein-Maxwell-(charged) Klein-Gordon equations. Each family bifurcates off a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{0},\phi_{0}\equiv0)$. For a co-dimensional one set of black hole parameters, we show that Dirichlet (respectively Neumann) boundary conditions can be imposed for the scalar field. The construction provides a counter-example to a version of the no-hair conjecture in the context of a negative cosmological constant. Our result is based on our companion work [W. Zheng, \emph{Exponentially-growing Mode Instability on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de-Sitter black holes}], in which the existence of linear hair and growing mode solutions have been established. In the charged scalar field case, our result provides the first rigorous mathematical construction of the so-called holographic superconductors, which are of particular significance in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole energy extraction, irreducible mass feedback, and the effect of captured particles charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward (inward) and protons inward (outward) in a region around the BH poles (equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles $-60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ$ and the equatorial region $60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ$. The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience a cyclic behavior: starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy, and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metric-Palatini Gravity from QPO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study metric-Palatini gravity extended by the antisymmetric part of the affine curvature. This gravity theory leads to general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Using our previous construction of its static spherically-symmetric AdS solution [Eur. Phys. J. C83 (2023) 4, 318], we perform a detailed analysis in this work using the observational quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) data. To this end, we use the latest data from stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40, intermediate-mass black hole in M82-X1, and the super-massive black hole in SgA* (our Milky Way) and perform a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) analysis to determine or bound the model parameters. Our results shed light on the allowed ranges of the Proca mass and other parameters. The results imply that our solutions can cover all three astrophysical black holes. Our analysis can also be extended to more general metric-affine gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy, and a Dark Fluid, from topology and a massless spinor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the existence of a massless spinor degrees of freedom in a spacetime with internal boundaries, such as black holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as GR with dark energy and some dark fluid. This can alleviate the problems of dark energy, and perhaps of dark matter. The dark fluid term remains to be further analysed. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.</description>

      <title>On Geodesic motion of particles with zero energy in Kerr and rotating dirty black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the properties of timelike geodesic for particles with zero energy. We found some similarities between geodesic motion in Schwarzschild black hole and timelike geodesics for particles with zero energy. We show, that general relativistic corrections might disappear for negative energies. The existence of circular orbits for zero-energy particles might lead to an unbound center of mass energy of two colliding particles. However, in this work, we explicitly show that closed orbits are absent for zero energy particles in generic axially symmetric black holes. We also investigate timelike motion in generic axially symmetric black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the peculiar manner by which physicists reckon descent, this article is by a "child" and "grandchild" of the late Stanley Deser. We begin by sharing reminiscences of Stanley from over 40 years. Then we turn to a problem which was dear to his heart: the prospect that gravity might nonperturbatively screen its own ultraviolet divergences and those of other theories. After reviewing the original 1960 work by ADM, we describe a cosmological analogue of the problem and then begin the process of implementing it in gravity plus QED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the conservative scattering angle of two classical charged particles at the sixth order in electromagnetic coupling, and at the fourth order in velocity, thereby going beyond the current state of the art [fifth order in coupling, derived by Bern {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 251601 (2024)]. Our result is obtained by using the electromagnetic version of the Effective One-Body formalism to transfer information from the exact circular binary-charge solution of Schild [Phys. Rev. \textbf{131}, 2762 (1963)] to the post-Lorentzian expansion of the scattering angle.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell systems and R-flux modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative Einstein--Dirac-Maxwell, EDM, theory determined by star product R-flux deformations in string theory. Solutions for nonassociative EDM systems and physical properties not studied in modern physics. For modifications of the four-dimensional, 4-d, Einstein gravity, we work on conventional nonassociative 8-d phase spaces modelled as star-deformed co-tangent Lorentz bundles. Generalizing the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, the nonassociative EDM equations are decoupled and integrated in exact and parametric quasi-stationary forms. Corresponding generic off-diagonal metrics are described by nonlinear symmetries and encode nonassociative effective sources and generating functions depending on space and momentum-like coordinates. For respective nonholonomic parameterizations, such solutions describe nonassociative deformations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. A variant of nonassociative phase space wormhole solution with fermions possessing anisotropic polarized masses is also analyzed. We conclude that such phase space physical objects can't be characterized using the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and show how to compute another type (modified G. Perelman ones) nonassociative geometric and statistical thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of \(\kappa\) Minkowski-type quantum spacetime on neutrino oscillations, revealing that spacetime fluctuations introduce a unique energy-dependent power law, \(E^{-4}\), in the decoherence effect for relic neutrinos. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-energy neutrinos, such as those from the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results indicate the potential for new models of low-energy quantum gravity-induced decoherence, which could pave the way for future experiments, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, to further constrain the deformation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Time Evolution of Compact Binary Systems with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces advanced computational techniques for modeling the time evolution of compact binary systems using machine learning. The dynamics of compact binary systems, such as black holes and neutron stars, present significant nonlinear challenges due to the strong gravitational interactions and the requirement for precise numerical simulations. Traditional methods, like the post-Newtonian approximation, often require significant computational resources and face challenges in accuracy and efficiency. Here, we employed machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), to predict the future evolution of these systems based on extensive simulation data. Our results demonstrate that employing both LSTM and TCN even as black-box predictors for sequence prediction can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy without PINNs as PDE solvers with prior knowledge or inductive bias. By employing LSTM and TCN, we obtained $R^2$ values of 99.74\% and 99.19\% for the evolutionary orbits of compact binaries dataset, respectively. Our models demonstrate the ability to effectively capture the dynamics of the binaries, achieving high prediction performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by a factor of 40, compared to conventional numerical methods. This study paves the way for more effective and computationally scalable approaches to the understanding of gravitational phenomena and predictive modeling in gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Comparison of HMG and flat rotation velocities inferred from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of dark-matter models, unresolved issues require exploring alternatives such as modified gravity theories. In this context, we examine the compatibility of the Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) with galaxy rotation curves inferred from weak-lensing data. The research addresses the existing limitations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which often struggle with universal applicability across different galactic scales. By assuming local validity of General Relativity (GR) and analyzing recent data on circular velocities from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, our findings interpret the galactic dynamics anomaly as a fictitious acceleration inherited from the cosmic expansion, without invoking dark matter. The results indicate that HMG successfully reproduces flat velocity curves on scales of 1 Mpc slightly better than MOND. Therefore, these observations support HMG as a viable gravitational model, highlighting its potential to account for dynamics on galaxies and other scales. Further research with extensive datasets is required to confirm these preliminary insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved operator for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved operators corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic `in' and `out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOC have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of mutual information, entanglement negativity, and multipartite correlations in holographic RG flows, particularly during phase transitions. Mutual information provides a UV-finite measure of total correlations between subsystems, while entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations offer finer insights into quantum structures, especially near critical points. Through numerical simulations, we show that while mutual information remains relatively smooth, both entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations exhibit sharp changes near phase transitions. These results support the hypothesis that multipartite correlations play a dominant role in signaling critical phenomena in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Uniform Energy Bound for Maxwell-Higgs Equations on Reissner-Nordstr\"om Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniform energy bound for the Maxwell-Higgs system in the exterior region of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing an integrated local energy decay (ILED) estimate in combination with the Sobolev embedding theorem on a compact Riemannian manifold, we derived $L^\infty$ bounds for the fields. These results were then used to obtain a bound for the conformal energy of the system using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hardy-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Landau Yang Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions). We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>From on-shell amplitude in AdS to cosmological correlators: gluons and gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently introduced a recursive bootstrap method for constructing $n$-point gluon and graviton Mellin-momentum amplitudes in (A)dS spacetime. The power of this approach was illustrated by our successful computation of the first five-point graviton amplitude in (A)dS. In this work, we provide further details of these calculations and start with a more in-depth review of the formalism by offering detailed insights into the motivation for defining on-shell amplitudes in AdS, along with various explicit examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate how cosmological correlators can be effortlessly obtained once the amplitude is determined.</description>

      <title>Long-Time 2D Simulations of Fallback Supernovae: A Systematic Investigation of Explosions Dynamics and Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of eight fallback simulations of zero-metallicity progenitors with masses between $60 M_\odot$ and $95 M_\odot$. The simulations are computed in 2D with the general relativistic CoCoNuT-FMT code for the first few seconds after black hole formation, and then mapped to the Newtonian code Prometheus for long-duration simulations beyond shock breakout. All simulations produce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \times 10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7 M_\odot$ to $34.4 M_\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary monotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer edge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating provides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to reach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole formation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately captured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to extrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We also discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback explosions. The enrichment of the ejecta in intermediate mass and iron-group elements varies considerably and is non-neligible for the more powerful explosions. Low-level neutrino emission after black hole formation from these very massive progenitors may be detectable in the case of a Galactic event.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of Lorentz-violating Maxwell fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the Lorentz-violating modifications of the propagation properties of the massless photon in the null formalism. Starting with the Maxwell Lagrangian in the minimal standard model extension, we derive the Maxwell equations in the null formalism based on the fact that at leading order of optical approximation, the light cone structure for the CPT-violating (CPTV) $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term is unaltered, though it does receive higher order corrections. Assuming the order expansion as $\phi_0=\sum_{n=1}\phi^{n-1}_0/r^{n+2}$ and reserving only leading order corrections of the $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term, we find that the asymptotic behaviors of the three complex scalars deviate from the LI counterparts, namely, $\phi_a^0\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{a-3})$ is no longer valid provided $k^2\neq0$. Our results also gives unnatural constraints: $k^2+4k^1=0$ and $\mathrm{Re}[\phi_1^0]=0$. We attribute this unnaturalness may be the flaw of our perturbative treatment,by comparison with the formal dipole radiation solutions in Ref. \cite{vacuoCerenRad}. In other words, we conjecture that the non-perturbative nature of the CPTV modification of the polarization structure may forbid a consistent perturbative treatment of the NP equations. If that is true, then the exact results reveal that not only CPTV modifies the phase factor as a kinematic effect, it also modifies the amplitude and the asymptotic behavior of the radiation and Coulomb modes as dynamical effects. This dramatically changes the peeling law of the two modes at large distances, which may provide new signal of the deviation from exact Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Robust Discontinuous Galerkin Methods Maintaining Physical Constraints for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) presents challenges such as handling curved spacetime, achieving high-order shock-capturing accuracy, and preserving key physical constraints (positive density, pressure, and subluminal velocity) under nonlinear coupling. This paper introduces high-order, physical-constraint-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (PCP-OEDG) schemes with Harten-Lax-van Leer flux for GRHD. To suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities, we incorporate a computationally efficient oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure based on a linear damping equation, maintaining accuracy and avoiding complex characteristic decomposition. To enhance stability and robustness, we construct PCP schemes using the W-form of GRHD equations with Cholesky decomposition of the spatial metric, addressing the non-equivalence of admissible state sets in curved spacetime. We rigorously prove the PCP property of cell averages via technical estimates and the Geometric Quasi-Linearization (GQL) approach, which transforms nonlinear constraints into linear forms. Additionally, we present provably convergent PCP iterative algorithms for robust recovery of primitive variables, ensuring physical constraints are satisfied throughout. The PCP-OEDG method is validated through extensive tests, demonstrating its robustness, accuracy, and capability to handle extreme GRHD scenarios involving strong shocks, high Lorentz factors, and intense gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum nature of gravity in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust, Rapid, and Simple Gravitational-wave Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and robust parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources is a key component of modern multi-messenger astronomy. We present a novel and straightforward method for rapid parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources that uses metric-based importance sampling. The method enables robust parameter estimation of binary neutron star and binary black hole binaries and is trivially parallelized, enabling full parameter estimation in seconds with modest resources. The algorithm achieves an average 35% effective sampling efficiency for the majority of aligned-spin neutron star binaries sources. Surprisingly, this approach is also highly efficient for analyzing the full 15-dimensional parameter space of typical binary black holes, with 20% efficiency achieved for a source detected primarily by the twin LIGO observatories and 9% for a network of three comparable sensitivity observatories. This method can serve immediate use to improve the low-latency data products of the gravitational-wave observatory network and may be a key component of how the millions of sources observed by next-generation observatories could be analyzed. The approach can also be broadly applied for problems where an approximate likelihood metric-space can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Derivative Coupling Cosmology and the Speed of Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called Nonminimal Derivative Coupling (NDC) is an alternative to General Relativity, which produces an asymptotic inflationary mechanism when applied to cosmology. The detection of gravitational waves in the last decade has imposed very stringent constraints over gravitational theories, which gave rise to a massive revision of those theories, in order to investigate the compatibility between them and that observational data. In this paper, we review NDC and address the question if it is compatible with gravitational waves or not. We show that the very existence of gravitational waves in this theory is restricted to a limited range in phase space and there are no accelerated solutions compatible with the present day data for the speed of such waves. This last result is alleviated by the fact that we did not detect primordial gravitational waves so far. Those conclusions are based on the comparison between the expression for the speed of tensor perturbations and the phase space. Finally, some possible scenarios and solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Conservative limits on the electric charge of Sgr A* in the Reissner-Nordstrom metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, the gravitational field of an electrically charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body is described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) metric. Depending on the charge to mass ratio, the solution describes a black hole or a naked singularity. In the naked-singularity regime, a general property of this metric is the existence of a radius, known as the zero-gravity radius, where a test particle would remain at rest. As a consequence of repulsive gravity there is no circular orbit inside this radius, and at least a part of any quasi-stable structure must necessarily lie outside of it. Assuming the iconic torus in the compact source Sgr A* at the Galactic center observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to be the image of a quasi-stationary fluid structure, we provide rigorous constraints in the RN metric on the electric charge-to-mass ratio Q/M of Sgr A*. A comparison between the EHT observations and the space-time zero-gravity radius provides the most conservative limit on the charge of Sgr A* to be |Q/M| &lt; 2.32 in geometrized units. A charged naked singularity respecting this charge-to-mass constraint is consistent with the current EHT observations, if the image is not interpreted as a photon ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15450v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the formation of a wormhole typically involves a violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), but the reverse is not necessarily true. In the context of Brans-Dicke gravity, the $\textit{generalized}$ Campanelli-Lousto solution, which we shall unveil in this paper, demonstrates a WEC violation that coincides with the appearance of $\textit{unbounded}$ sheets of spacetime within the "interior" section. The emergence of a wormhole in the "exterior" section is thus only an indirect consequence of the WEC violation. Additionally, we use the generalized Campanelli-Lousto solution to construct a Kruskal-Szekeres diagram, which exhibits a "gulf" sandwiched between the four quadrants in the diagram, a novel feature in Brans-Dicke gravity. Overall, our findings shed new light onto a complex interplay between the WEC and wormholes in the Brans-Dicke theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe in searches for dark matter. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detector's hardware. In this work, we explore the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with the LIGO detectors. We analyze domain walls consisting of dark matter passing through the Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with light in the interferometer, and with the beam splitter, we perform the first analysis of topological dark matter with gravitational-wave strain data. We examine whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain-wall passages. We find that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyze favor the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain-wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover, we find that some topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we find that special types of glitches in the measurement data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide future searches and analyses.</description>

      <title>A gating-and-inpainting perspective on GW150914 ringdown overtone: understanding the data analysis systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the recent debate on the evidence for an overtone in the black hole ringdown of GW150914 using an independent data-analysis pipeline. By gating and inpainting the data, we discard the contamination from earlier parts of the gravitational wave signal before ringdown. This enables parameter estimation to be conducted in the frequency domain, which is mathematically equivalent to the time domain method. We keep the settings as similar as possible to the previous studies by Cotesta et al. arXiv:2201.00822 and Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941 which yielded conflicting results on the Bayes factor of the overtone. Our aim is to understand how different data analysis systematics, including sampling rates, erroneous timestamps, the frequency resolution of the noise power spectrum, and the parameterization of ringdown amplitudes, would influence the statistical significance of an overtone. Our main results indicate the following: (i) a low-resolution estimation of the noise power spectrum tends to diminish the significance of overtones, (ii) adjusting the start time to a later digitized point reduces the significance of overtones, and (iii) overtone evidence varies with different sampling rates if the start time is too early, indicating that the overtone is a poor model, hence we propose a convergence test to verify the validity of an overtone model. With these issues addressed, we find the Bayes factors for the overtone to range from $10$ to $26$ in a range of times centered at the best-fit merger time of GW150914, which supports the existence of an overtone in agreement with the conclusions of Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we use the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to constrain the parameters of braneworld black holes which constrain $\epsilon=0.0285^{+0.0888+0.1456}_{-0.0895-0.1475}$ for the anisotropic black hole and $q=-0.0305^{+0.1034+0.1953}_{-0.0895-0.1470}$ for the tidal Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (RN) black hole. Based on the fitted data and physical requirement, we calculate the photon deflection, the angular separation and time delay between different relativistic images of the anisotropic black hole and the tidal RN black hole in the ranges $-0.1190&lt;\epsilon&lt;0$ and $-0.1775 &lt;q&lt;0$. And furthermore, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for the braneworld black holes. The results shed light on existence of extra dimension.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Lorentzian quantum cosmology: No-boundary saddles and resummation of quantum gravity corrections around tunneling saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the path-integral approach to the wave function of the Universe by utilizing Lefschetz thimble analyses and resurgence theory. The traditional Euclidean path-integral of gravity has the notorious ambiguity of the direction of Wick rotation. In contrast, the Lorentzian method can be formulated concretely with the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Yet, a challenge remains: the physical parameter space lies on a Stokes line, meaning that the Lefschetz-thimble structure is still unclear. Through complex deformations, we resolve this issue by uniquely identifying the thimble structure. This leads to the tunneling wave function, as opposed to the no-boundary wave function, offering a more rigorous proof of the previous results. Further exploring the parameter space, we discover rich structures: the ambiguity of the Borel resummation of perturbative series around the tunneling saddle points is exactly canceled by the ambiguity of the contributions from no-boundary saddle points. This indicates that resurgence also works in quantum cosmology, particularly in the minisuperspace model.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of first-class constraints and the quantization of gauge theories: from "matter without matter" to the reappearance of time in quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make a conceptual overview of a particular approach to the initial-value problem in canonical gauge theories. We stress how the first-class phase-space constraints may be relaxed if we interpret them as fixing the values of new degrees of freedom. This idea goes back to Fock and Stueckelberg, leading to restrictions of the gauge symmetry of a theory, and it corresponds, in certain cases, to promoting constants of Nature to physical fields. Recently, different versions of this formulation have gained considerable attention in the literature, with several independent iterations, particularly in classical and quantum descriptions of gravity, cosmology, and electromagnetism. In particular, in the case of canonical quantum gravity, the Fock--Stueckelberg approach is relevant to the so-called problem of time. Our overview recalls and generalizes the work of Fock and Stueckelberg and its physical interpretation with the aim of conceptually unifying the different iterations of the idea that appear in the literature and of motivating further research.</description>

      <title>New exact solution and $\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss the de Sitter swampland conjectures in the context of the generalized Chaplygin-inspired inflationary model. We demonstrate that these conjectures can be satisfied, but only in the region of the parameter space far away from the General Relativity limit. The cosmic microwave background data had already been found to restrict the allowed inflationary potentials of this model. Our results impose a further limitation on the possible potentials.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs) is investigated in a comprehensive analysis with particular attention to the role of the nuclear equation of state. Hadronic matter is modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model is based on the neutron decay anomaly. The non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS are studied in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters, NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>Influence of pressure anisotropy and non-metricity parameter on mass-radius relation and stability of millisecond pulsar in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we explore the astrophysical implications of pressure anisotropy on the physical characteristics of millisecond pulsars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, {in particular $f(Q)=-\alpha\, Q - \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants.} Starting off with the field equations for anisotropic matter configurations, we adopt the physically salient Durgapal-Fuloria ansatz together with a well-motivated anisotropic factor for the interior matter distribution. This leads to a nonlinear second order differential equation which is integrated to give the complete gravitational and thermodynamical properties of the stellar object. The resulting model is subjected to rigorous tests to ensure that it qualifies as a physically viable compact object within the $f(Q)$-gravity framework. We study in detail the impact of anisotropy on the mass, radius and stability of the star. Our analyses indicate that our models are well-behaved, singularity-free and can account for the existence of a wide range of observed pulsars with masses ranging from 2.08 to 2.67 $M_{\odot}$, with the upper value being in the so-called {\em mass gap} regime observed in gravitational events such as GW190814. {A comparison of the so-called {\em Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR} (STEGR) models with classical General Relativity (GR) models reveal that the anisotropy parameter and the sign of $\beta$ impact on the predicted radii of pulsars. In particular, STEGR models have larger radii than their GR counterparts.</description>

      <title>Stability of charged scalar hair on a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Israel-Carter theorem (also known as the "no-hair theorem") puts a restriction on the existence of parameters other than mass, electric charge, and angular momentum of a black hole. In this context, Bekenstein proposed no-hair theorems in various black hole models with neutral and electrically charged scalar fields.
  In this paper, we take the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar model with an electrically charged scalar field gauge-coupled to the Maxwell field surrounding a charged black hole with a static spherically symmetric metric. In particular, we consider a quadratic scalar potential without any higher order terms and we do not impose any restriction on the magnitude of the scalar charge with respect to the black hole charge.
  With this setting, we ascertain the validity of all energy conditions coupled with the causality condition, suggesting the possibility of existence of charged hairy solutions. Consequently, we obtain, by exact numerical integration, detailed solutions of the field equations that incorporate backreaction on the spacetime due to the presence of the charged scalar field. The solutions exhibit damped oscillatory behaviours for the charged scalar hair. We also find that the electric potential is a monotonic function of the radial coordinate, as required by electrodynamics.
  In order to ascertain the existence of our charged hairy solutions, we carry out dynamic stability analyses against time-dependant perturbations about the static solutions. For a definite conclusion, we employ two different methodologies. The first methodology involves a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the second methodology employs a Schr\"odinger-like equation, for the dynamic perturbations. We find that our solutions are stable against time-dependant perturbations by both methodologies, confirming the existence of the charged hairy solutions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images of the back side of the ring.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for the global fitting of all resolvable sources, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave signals. However, such analyses usually entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we explore the application of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Specifically, we employ linear interpolation and trig interpolation methods to construct transport paths for training CNFs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within CNFs, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using CNFs. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of equipotential photon surfaces in 4-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes for positive, negative, and zero mass -- and a new partial proof of the Willmore inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present different proofs of the uniqueness of 4-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes containing a connected equipotential photon surface or in particular a connected photon sphere. We do not assume that the equipotential photon surface is outward directed or non-degenerate and hence cover not only the positive but also the negative and the zero mass case which has not yet been treated in the literature. Our results partially reproduce and extend beyond results by Cederbaum and by Cederbaum and Galloway. In the positive and negative mass cases, we give three proofs which are based on the approaches to proving black hole uniqueness by Israel, Robinson, and Agostiniani--Mazzieri, respectively. In the zero mass case, we give four proofs. One is based on the positive mass theorem, the second one is inspired by Israel's approach and in particular leads to a new proof of the Willmore inequality in $(\mathbb{R}^3, \delta)$, under a technical assumption. The remaining two proofs are inspired by proofs of the Willmore inequality by Cederbaum and Miehe and by Agostiniani and Mazzieri, respectively. In particular, this suggests to view the Willmore inequality and its rigidity case as a zero mass version of equipotential photon surface uniqueness.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a series of exact solutions to Einstein-Maxwell equation under nonlinear electrodynamics theory (NED), which are considered as a natural extension of the dyonic RN solution. Our results are based on a general premise demanding a spherically symmetric spacetime but with few restrictions on the specific form of the EM action. We discuss some of its properties including ADM mass, quasi-local mass, asymptotic behavior, energy condition and so on. We study the EM-gravity coupled perturbation in this spacetime using Newman-Penrose (NP) form, which can be regarded as a small generalization of this method. We also generalize the former formula computing energy and angular momentum flux from the black hole horizon to study the super radiance of the Dirac field in this spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We critically discuss the claims of a recent article regarding the Newtonian limit of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) in pure-tetrad formulation (arXiv:2406.17594). In particular, we refute this article's purported main result that if a regular Newtonian limit exists, the torsion of the limiting derivative operator (i.e., connection) necessarily vanishes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes within the framework of non-commutative geometry. By solving the Einstein's equations, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that if the energy-momentum tensor outside the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole, the conventional first law of thermodynamics will be violated. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and a critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the Van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the conventional first law results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. Moreover, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion, obtaining the minimum inversion temperature and the minimum inversion mass.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $IN^2$ on the curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between the vector fields and the inflaton $I$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore a regime where $I\gg 1$. This regime has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Low-Scale Inflationary Magnetogenesis without Baryon Isocurvature Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetogenesis is an intriguing possibility to explain the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs). However, the baryon isocurvature problem has recently been pointed out, ruling out all magnetogenesis models operating above the electroweak scale. In this letter, we show that lower-scale inflationary scenarios with a Chern-Simons coupling can evade this problem. We propose concrete inflationary models whose reheating temperatures are lower than the electroweak scale and numerically compute the amount of magnetic fields generated during inflation and reheating. We find that, for lower reheating temperatures, the magnetic helicity decreases significantly. It is also possible to generate fully helical magnetic fields by modifying the inflaton potential. In both cases, the produced magnetic fields can be strong enough to explain the observed IGMFs, while avoiding the baryon isocurvature problem.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining black holes out of equilibrium with boundary observables on time slice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics, defining coarse-grained entropy for dynamical black holes has long been a challenge, and various proposals, such as generalized entropy, have been explored. Guided by the AdS/CFT, we introduce a new definition of coarse-grained entropy for a dynamical black hole in Lorentzian Einstein gravity. On each time slice, this entropy is defined as the horizon area of an auxiliary Euclidean black hole that shares the same mass, (angular) momenta, and asymptotic normalizable matter modes with the original Lorentzian solution. The entropy is shown to satisfy a generalized first law and, through holography, the second law as well. Furthermore, by applying this thermodynamics to several Vaidya models in AdS and flat spacetime, we discover a connection between the second law and the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical power-law lens mass model parameters, often introducing additional empirical parameters and constraints from high resolution imagery. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) in order to constrain both lens and cosmological parameters for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the timescape model. We then generate large mock data sets to further investigate the choice of cosmology on fitting simple power-law lens models. In agreement with previous results, we find that in combination with single isothermal sphere parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\mathrm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\mathrm v0}\to0.73$ and closely matches values that best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and the cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\mathrm v0}\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for timescape fits to both timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. With larger datasets soon available, separation of cosmology and lens models must be addressed.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Invariant tensions from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution and Thermal Renormalization Group Flow in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatments based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality"of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using LISA Bright Standard Sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set for launch in the mid-2030s, will enhance our capability to probe the universe through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary black holes (BBHs) across a broad range of cosmological distances. LISA is projected to observe three classes of BBHs: massive BBHs (MBBHs), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and stellar mass BBHs. This study focuses on MBBHs, which are anticipated to occur in gas-rich environments conducive to producing powerful electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, positioning them as excellent candidates for bright sirens. By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from these bright sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and spectroscopic redshift measurements from electromagnetic (EM) observations, we propose a data-driven model-independent method to reconstruct deviations in the variation of the effective Planck mass (in conjunction with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this multi-messenger technique, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift (z), with a precision ranging from approximately $2.4\%$ to $7.2\%$ from redshift $z=1$ to $z=6$ with a single event. Additionally, we achieved a measurement of the Hubble constant with a precision of about $1.3\%$, accounting for variations in the effective Planck mass over 4 years of observation time ($T_{\mathrm{obs}}$). This assumes that EM counterparts are detected for $75\%$ of the events. This precision improves with observation time as $T_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1/2}$. This approach not only has the potential to reveal deviations from General Relativity but also to significantly expand our understanding of the universe's fundamental physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction to two dimensions of certain gravitational theories in $D \geq 4$ dimensions at the two-derivative level. It is known that the resulting field equations describe an integrable system in two dimensions which can also be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. We use this relation to construct a single copy prescription for classes of gravitational solutions in Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates. In contrast with previous proposals, we find that the gauge group of the Yang-Mills single copy carries non-trivial information about the gravitational solution. We illustrate our single copy prescription with various examples that include the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the Kaluza-Klein rotating attractor solution, the Einstein-Rosen wave solution and the self-dual Kleinian Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Flat-Space Limit of Holographic Pseudo Entropy in (A)dS Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real part of pseudo entropy in conformal field theories is holographically calculated by the area of some extremal spacelike surfaces in the dual dS and AdS spacetimes. We show that the flat-space limit of these curves in three-dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well defined. We find that if the length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the retarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the entanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is obtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum of retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results suggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual theory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit of pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)dS spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied various mixed state information theoretic quantities for an excited state of Lifshitz spacetime in $3+1$-dimensions. This geometry is the gravity dual to a class of $2+1$-dimensional quantum field theories having Lifshitz symmetry. We have holographically calculated mutual information, entanglement wedge cross section, entanglement negativity and mutual complexity for strip like subsystems at the boundary. For this we have used the results of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity present in the literature. We first calculate all of these mentioned quantities for the pure state of Lifshitz spacetime. Then we have moved on to calculate all these quantities for excited state of the Lifshitz spacetime. The gravity dual of excited state of Lifshitz systems in field theory can be obtained by applying constant perturbations along the boundary direction. Further, we would like to mention that for the simplicity of calculation we are only considering results up to the first order in perturbation. The change in the obtained holographic information theoretic quantities are then related to entanglement entropy, entanglement pressure, entanglement chemical potential and charge using the stress tensor complex. These relations are analogous to the first law of entanglement thermodynamics given earlier in the literature. All the calculations are carried out for both values of dynamical scaling exponent ($z$) present in the Lifshitz field theory.</description>

      <title>Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by PLANCK and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits for realising quantum processes in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13387</link>

Abstract: Understanding the interface between quantum and relativistic theories is crucial for fundamental and practical advances, especially given that key physical concepts such as causality take different forms in these theories. Bell's no-go theorem reveals limits on classical processes, arising from relativistic causality principles. Considering whether similar fundamental limits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum experiments realisable in classical background spacetimes. We account for general processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite causal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our first theorem implies that realisations of ICO processes that do not violate relativistic causality must involve the non-localization of systems in spacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realisation of an ICO process, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of quantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to experimental realisations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By showing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go results also offer insights into how causality and information processing may differ in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>

Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>
