      <title>Disordered Lattice Glass $\phi^{4}$ Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the three-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ spin glass, a prototypical disordered and discretized Euclidean field theory that manifests inhomogeneities in space and time but considers a homogeneous squared mass and lambda terms. The $\phi^{4}$ lattice glass field theory is a conceptual generalization of spin glasses to continuous degrees of freedom and we discuss the existence of a limit under which it formally reduces to the Edwards-Anderson model. By defining four variants of an order parameter which are suitable for continuous spin glasses, we verify numerically the emergence of an overlap in absence of the magnetization thus confirming the presence of a spin glass phase transition for a value of a critical squared mass. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ spin glass can be utilized to address assumptions of complete homogeneity in space or time and how, in parallel to statistical physics, provides a suitable framework to investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of machine learning algorithms from the perspective of disordered lattice and constructive field theory.</description>

      <title>QCD with (2+1) flavors at the physical point in external chromomagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate full QCD with (2+1)-flavour of HISQ fermions at the physical point in the presence of uniform Abelian chromomagnetic background fields. Our focus is on the renormalized light and strange chiral condensate around the pseudo-critical temperature. We find that in the confined region the gauge system is subjected to the chromomagnetic catalysis that turns into the inverse catalysis in the high-temperature regime. We further observe that the chiral condensates are subjected to the so-called thermal hysteresis. Our estimate of the deconfinement temperature indicates that the critical temperature begins to decrease
  in the small field region, soon after it seems to saturate and finally increase with the strength of the chromomagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Sign Problem with simple Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply constant imaginary offsets to the path integral for a reduction of the sign problem in the Hubbard model. These simple transformations enhance the quality of results from HMC calculations without compromising the speed of the algorithm. This method enables us to efficiently calculate systems that are otherwise inaccessible due to a severe sign problem. To support this claim, we present observables of the C20 and C60 fullerenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at a certain offset, the sign problem is completely lifted in the limit of large chemical potential.</description>

      <title>The effect of charm quark on chiral phase transition in $N_f=2+1+1$ holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of charm quark on the chiral phase transition of light quarks at finite temperature based on the four-flavor soft-wall holographic QCD model. In the massless limit, we find that the thermal chiral phase transition is of the second order in the four-quark flavor system. In the case with the massive charm quark and the massless light and strange quarks, the order of the phase transition changes to the first order. This is due to the quark flavor symmetry breaking which is associated with the violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry. Once the light and strange quarks get massive, the explicit chiral symmetry breaking becomes eminent, then the crossover phase transition is realized at the physical quark masses. We also map the order of the phase transition on a phase diagram in the quark mass plane where the light- and strange-quark masses are degenerate but differ from the value of the charm quark mass. This phase diagram is an extension of the conventional Columbia plot to the four-quark flavor system. The critical exponents related to the chiral phase transition are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>
