      <title>Scaling Robust Optimization for Swarms: A Distributed Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a decentralized robust optimization framework for safe multi-agent control under uncertainty. Although stochastic noise has been the primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations might fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature or simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we employ the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible uncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard robust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or non-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To address this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly reduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the framework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic uncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution steering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a convergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition, computational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed frameworks against standard approaches are presented. Finally, the robustness and scalability of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation results across diverse scenarios, including environments with nonconvex obstacles and up to 246 agents.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Linear Policies in Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian.
  When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Programs via Deep Unrolled Douglas-Rachford Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex quadratic programs (QPs) are fundamental to numerous applications, including finance, engineering, and energy systems. Among the various methods for solving them, the Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithm is notable for its robust convergence properties. Concurrently, the emerging field of Learning-to-Optimize offers promising avenues for enhancing algorithmic performance, with algorithm unrolling receiving considerable attention due to its computational efficiency and interpretability. In this work, we propose an approach that unrolls a modified DR splitting algorithm to efficiently learn solutions for convex QPs. Specifically, we introduce a tailored DR splitting algorithm that replaces the computationally expensive linear system-solving step with a simplified gradient-based update, while retaining convergence guarantees. Consequently, we unroll the resulting DR splitting method and present a well-crafted neural network architecture to predict QP solutions. Our method achieves up to 50% reductions in iteration counts and 40% in solve time across benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world QP datasets, demonstrating its scalability and superior performance in enhancing computational efficiency across varying sizes.</description>

      <title>Virtual Trading in Multi-Settlement Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Day-Ahead (DA) market, suppliers sell and load-serving entities (LSEs) purchase energy commitments, with both sides adjusting for imbalances between contracted and actual deliveries in the Real-Time (RT) market. We develop a supply function equilibrium model to study how virtual trading-speculating on DA-RT price spreads without physical delivery-affects market efficiency. Without virtual trading, LSEs underbid relative to actual demand in the DA market, pushing DA prices below expected RT prices. Virtual trading narrows, and in the limit of large number traders can eliminates, this price gap. However, it does not induce quantity alignment: DA-cleared demand remains below true expected demand, as price alignment makes the LSE indifferent between markets and prompts it to reduce DA bids to avoid over-purchasing. Renewable energy suppliers cannot offset these strategic distortions. We provide empirical support to our main model implications using data from the California and New York Independent System Operators.</description>

      <title>An inexact variable metric proximal linearization method for composite optimization over embedded submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the minimization of the composition of a nonsmooth convex function and a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ mapping over a $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth embedded closed submanifold $\mathcal{M}$. For this class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, we propose an inexact variable metric proximal linearization method by leveraging its composite structure and the retraction and first-order information of $\mathcal{M}$, which at each iteration seeks an inexact solution to a subspace constrained strongly convex problem by a practical inexactness criterion. Under the common restricted level boundedness assumption, we establish the $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iteration complexity and the $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ calls to the subproblem solver for returning an $\epsilon$-stationary point, and prove that any cluster point of the iterate sequence is a stationary point. If in addition the constructed potential function has the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property on the set of cluster points, the iterate sequence is shown to converge to a stationary point, and if it has the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$, the local convergence rate is characterized. We also provide a condition only involving the original data to identify the KL property of the potential function with exponent $q\in(0,1)$. Numerical comparisons with RiADMM in Li et al. [25] and RiALM in Xu et al. [44] validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Active Fault Identification and Robust Control for Unknown Bounded Faults via Volume-Based Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for active fault diagnosis and parameter estimation in linear systems operating in closed-loop, subject to unknown but bounded faults. The approach integrates set-membership identification with a cost function designed to accelerate fault identification. Informative excitation is achieved by minimizing the size of the parameter uncertainty set, which is approximated using ellipsoidal outer bounds. Combining this formulation with a scheduling parameter enables a transition back to nominal control as confidence in the model estimates increases. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed approach does not rely on predefined fault models. Instead, it only requires known bounds on parameter deviations and additive disturbances. Robust constraint satisfaction is guaranteed through a tube-based model predictive control scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the method achieves faster fault detection and identification compared to passive strategies and adaptive ones based on persistent excitation constraints.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Mean-Variance Dividend Rate Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal dividend problem for a company that aims to maximize the mean-variance (MV) objective of the accumulated discounted dividend payments up to its ruin time. The MV objective involves an integral form over a random horizon that depends endogenously on the company's dividend strategy, and these features lead to a novel time-inconsistent control problem. To address the time inconsistency, we seek a time-consistent equilibrium dividend rate strategy. We first develop and prove a new verification lemma that characterizes the value function and equilibrium strategy by an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. Next, we apply the verification lemma to obtain the equilibrium strategy and show that it is a barrier strategy for small levels of risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Riemannian optimization model order reduction for linear systems with quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates structure-preserving $H_2$-optimal model order reduction (MOR) for linear systems with quadratic outputs. Within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework, the $H_2$-optimal MOR problem is first formulated as an optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, for which a corresponding bivariable alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to explicitly guarantee the asymptotic stability of the reduced-order model, a second approach is introduced by imposing specific constraints on the projection matrices. We reformulate the problem as a novel optimization task on the Stiefel manifold and construct a corresponding solution algorithm. The computational bottleneck in both iterative methods is addressed by developing an approximate solver for Sylvester equations based on orthogonal polynomial expansions, which significantly enhances the overall efficiency. Numerical experiments validate that the obtained reduced models provide significant advantages in approximation accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Can a One-Point Feedback Zeroth-order Algorithm Achieve Linear Dimension Dependent Sample Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the one-point feedback zeroth-order (ZO) optimization problem, a classical setting in derivative-free optimization where only a single noisy function evaluation is available per query. Compared to their two-point counterparts, existing one-point feedback ZO algorithms typically suffer from poor dimension dependence in their sample complexities -- often quadratic or worse -- even for convex problems. This gap has led to the open question of whether one-point feedback ZO algorithms can match the optimal \emph{linear} dimension dependence achieved by two-point methods. In this work, we answer this question \emph{affirmatively}.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Selection with Costly Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate joint optimization on information acquisition and portfolio selection within a Bayesian adaptive framework. The investor dynamically controls the precision of a private signal and incurs costs while updating her belief about the unobservable asset drift. Controllable information acquisition fails the classical separation principle of stochastic filtering. We adopt functional modeling of control to address the consequential endogeneity issues, then solve our optimization problem through dynamic programming. When the unknown drift follows a Gaussian prior, the HJB equation is often explicitly solvable via the method of characteristics, yielding sufficiently smooth classical solution to establish a verification theorem and confirm the optimality of feedback controls. In such settings, we find that the investor's information acquisition strategy is deterministic and could be decoupled from her trading strategy, indicating a weaker separation property. In some degenerate cases where classical solutions may fail, semi-explicit optimal controls remain attainable by regularizing the information cost.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Bayesian Robbins--Monro Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an iterative Bayesian Robbins--Monro (IBRM) sequence, which unites the classical Robbins--Monro sequence with statistical estimation for faster root-finding under noisy observations. Although the standard Robbins--Monro method iteratively approaches solutions, its convergence speed is limited by noisy measurements and naivety to any prior information about the objective function. The proposed Bayesian sequence dynamically updates the prior distribution with newly obtained observations to accelerate convergence rates and robustness. The paper demonstrates almost sure convergence of the sequence and analyses its convergence rates for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional problems. We evaluate the method in a practical application that suffers from large variability and allows only a few function evaluations, specifically estimating thresholds in noninvasive brain stimulation, where the method is more robust and accurate than conventional alternatives. Simulations involving 25,000 virtual subjects illustrate reduced error margins and decreased outlier frequency with direct impact on clinical use.</description>

      <title>EXOTIC: An Exact, Optimistic, Tree-Based Algorithm for Min-Max Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Min-max optimization arises in many domains such as game theory, adversarial machine learning, etc., with gradient-based methods as a typical computational tool. Beyond convex-concave min-max optimization, the solutions found by gradient-based methods may be arbitrarily far from global optima. In this work, we present an algorithmic apparatus for computing globally optimal solutions in convex-non-concave and non-convex-concave min-max optimization. For former, we employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters. Both our algorithmic apparatus along with its accompanying theoretical analysis can also be applied for non-convex-concave min-max optimization. In addition, we propose a class of benchmark convex-non-concave min-max problems along with their analytical global solutions, providing a testbed for evaluating algorithms for min-max optimization. Empirically, EXOTIC outperforms gradient-based methods on this benchmark as well as on existing numerical benchmark problems from the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of EXOTIC by computing security strategies in multi-player games with three or more players.</description>

      <title>Graphon Mean-Field Logit Dynamic: Derivation, Computation, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphon mean-field logit dynamic, a stationary mean-field game based on logit interactions. This dynamic emerges from a stochastic control problem involving a continuum of nonexchangeable and interacting agents and reduces to solving a continuum of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations connected through a graphon that models the connections among agents. Using a fixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in the space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are myopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of the system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for computing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its numerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on inland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A series of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence of the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon.</description>

      <title>An Online Non-Stationary Simulation Optimization Approach Based on Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic and evolving operational and economic environments present significant challenges for decision-making. We explore a simulation optimization problem characterized by non-stationary input distributions with regime-switching dynamics across sequential decision stages. This problem encompasses both prediction uncertainty, arising from the regime-switching behavior of input distributions, and input uncertainty, resulting from parameter estimation for these distributions and their dynamics using finite data streams. To address these uncertainties, we develop a Bayesian framework that approximates the true objective function using a Markov Switching Model (MSM). We rigorously validate this approximation by establishing the consistency and asymptotic normality of the objective functions and optimal solutions. To solve the problem in an online fashion, we propose a metamodel-based algorithm that leverages simulation results from previous stages to enhance decision-making. Furthermore, we tackle scenarios with an unknown number of regimes through a Bayesian nonparametric method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior performance and robust adaptability.</description>

      <title>A class of generalized Nesterov's accelerated gradient method from dynamical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of \textit{Euler-Lagrange} equations indexed by a pair of parameters ($\alpha,r$) that generalizes Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods for convex ($\alpha=1$) and strongly convex ($\alpha=0$) functions from a continuous-time perspective. This class of equations also serves as an interpolation between the two Nesterov's schemes. The corresponding \textit{Hamiltonian} systems can be integrated via the symplectic Euler scheme with a fixed step-size. Furthermore, we can obtain the convergence rates for these equations ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) that outperform Nesterov's when time is sufficiently large for $\mu$-strongly convex functions, without requiring a priori knowledge of $\mu$. We demonstrate this by constructing a class of Lyapunov functions that also provide a unified framework for Nesterov's schemes for convex and strongly convex functions.</description>

      <title>On Constraint Qualifications for MPECs with Applications to Bilevel Hyperparameter Optimization for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint qualifications for a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) are essential for analyzing stationarity properties and establishing convergence results. In this paper, we explore several classical MPEC constraint qualifications and clarify the relationships among them. We subsequently examine the behavior of these constraint qualifications in the context of a specific MPEC derived from bilevel hyperparameter optimization (BHO) for L1-loss support vector classification. In particular, for such an MPEC, we provide a complete characterization of the well-known MPEC linear independence constraint qualification (MPEC-LICQ), therefore, establishing conditions under which it holds or fails for our BHO for support vector machines.</description>

      <title>Sufficient A Priori Conditions for the Linear Relaxation of the Energy Storage Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modeling energy storage systems, an essential question is how to account for the physical infeasibility of simultaneous charge and discharge. The use of complementarity constraints or of binary variables is common, but these formulations do not scale well. Alternatively, assumptions such as perfect efficiencies or positive prices are often used to justify the choice of a linear model. In this paper, we establish new a priori conditions that guarantee the existence of an optimal solution without simultaneous charge and discharge when solving the linear relaxation of the storage scheduling problem. They are based on the characteristics of the storage system, in particular, the duration of charge. They can be valid for negative prices and with inefficiencies, thereby enlarging the set of conditions for which the complementarity constraints can be relaxed. We prove mathematically the validity of these conditions and illustrate them with practical examples. We also introduce a refined mixed-integer linear equivalent, in which the number of binary variables can be drastically reduced.</description>

      <title>Matrix Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the control barrier function framework by replacing scalar-valued functions with matrix-valued ones. Specifically, we develop barrier conditions for safe sets defined by matrix inequalities -- both semidefinite and indefinite. Matrix inequalities can be used to describe a richer class of safe sets, including nonsmooth ones. The safety filters constructed from our proposed matrix control barrier functions via semidefinite programming (CBF-SDP) are shown to be continuous. Our matrix formulation naturally provides a continuous safety filter for Boolean-based control barrier functions, notably for disjunctions (OR), without relaxing the safe set. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with applications in drone network connectivity maintenance and nonsmooth obstacle avoidance, both in simulations and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.</description>

      <title>Universal Learning of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system. Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems. This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new design framework for dynamic output-feedback controllers for Lur'e oscillation in a multiple-input multiple-output setting. We first revisit and extend dominant system theory to state-dependent rates, with the goal of deriving conditions based on linear matrix inequalities. Then, we introduce a separation principle for Lur'e oscillator design, which allows for the independent design of a state-feedback oscillator and an observer. Our proposed control synthesis is demonstrated through the rhythm synchronization in multi-agent systems, illustrating how networks of stable, heterogeneous linear agents can be driven into phase-locked rhythmic behavior.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of set-point tracking for a discrete-time plant with unknown plant parameters belonging to a convex and compact uncertainty set. We carry out parameter estimation for an associated auxiliary plant, and a pole-placement-based control law is employed. We prove that this adaptive controller provides desirable linear-like closed-loop behavior which guarantees a bound consisting of: exponential decay with respect to the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound with respect to the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the parameter estimator update law. This implies that the system has a bounded gain. Moreover, asymptotic tracking is also proven when the disturbance is constant.</description>

Abstract: The Partial Correlation Graphical LASSO (PCGLASSO) offers a scale-invariant alternative to the standard GLASSO. This paper provides the first comprehensive treatment of the PCGLASSO estimator.
  We introduce a novel and highly efficient algorithm. Our central theoretical contribution is the first scale-invariant irrepresentability criterion for PCGLASSO, which guarantees consistent model selection. We prove this condition is significantly weaker than its GLASSO counterpart, providing the first theoretical justification for PCGLASSO's superior empirical performance, especially in recovering networks with hub structures. Furthermore, we deliver the first analysis of the estimator's non-convex solution landscape, establishing new conditions for global uniqueness and guaranteeing the consistency of all minimizers.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Lion Optimizer in Centralized and Distributed Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer. First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with $n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart, achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the Schr\"odinger bridge problems by a family of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems with no terminal time distribution constraint. In doing so, we use the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures and then describe the constraint as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the control problems. A sequence of the probability laws of the state processes resulting from $\epsilon$-optimal controls converges to a unique solution of the Schr\"odinger's problem under mild conditions on given initial and terminal time distributions and an underlying diffusion process. We propose a neural SDE based deep learning algorithm for the Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems. Several numerical experiments validate our methods.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the dynamic programming principle for set-valued functions arising from many applications, in this paper we propose a new notion of set-valued PDEs. The key component in the theory is a set-valued It\^{o} formula, characterizing the flows on the surface of the dynamic sets. In the contexts of multivariate control problems, we establish the wellposedness of the set-valued HJB equations, which extends the standard HJB equations in the scalar case to the multivariate case. As an application, a moving scalarization for certain time inconsistent problems is constructed by using the classical solution of the set-valued HJB equation.</description>

Abstract: Recognition of an adversary's objective is a core problem in physical security and cyber defense. Prior work on target recognition focuses on developing optimal inference strategies given the adversary's operating environment. However, the success of such strategies significantly depends on features of the environment. We consider the problem of optimal counterdeceptive environment design: construction of an environment which promotes early recognition of an adversary's objective, given operational constraints. Viewed as a bounded-length graph-design problem, we introduce a metric for counterdeception and a novel heuristic that maximizes it based on iterative reattachment of trees. We benchmark the performance of this algorithm on synthetic networks as well as a graph inspired by a real-world high-security environment, verifying that the proposed algorithm is computationally feasible and yields meaningful network designs.</description>

      <title>A penalty barrier framework for nonconvex constrained optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimization problems with structured objective function and smooth constraints, and present a flexible framework that combines the beneficial regularization effects of (exact) penalty and interior-point methods. In the fully nonconvex setting, a pure barrier approach requires careful steps when approaching the infeasible set, thus hindering convergence. We show how a tight integration with a penalty scheme mitigates this issue and enables the construction of subproblems whose domain is independent of the explicit constraints. This decoupling allows us to leverage efficient solvers designed for unconstrained or suitably structured optimization tasks. The key behind all this is a marginalization step: closely related to a conjugacy operation, this step effectively merges (exact) penalty and barrier into a smooth, full domain functional object. When the penalty exactness takes effect, the generated subproblems do not suffer the ill-conditioning typical of barrier methods, nor do they exhibit the nonsmoothness of exact penalty terms. We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic properties, deriving convergence results for fully nonconvex problems. Stronger conclusions are available for the convex setting, where optimality can be guaranteed. Illustrative examples and numerical simulations demonstrate the wide range of problems our theory and algorithm are able to cover.</description>

      <title>Continuous time Stochastic optimal control under discrete time partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses stochastic optimal control problems where the unknown state evolves in continuous time while partial, noisy, and possibly controllable measurements are only available in discrete time. We develop a framework for controlling such systems, focusing on the measure-valued process of the system's state and the control actions that depend on noisy and incomplete data. Our approach uses a stochastic optimal control framework with a probability measure-valued state, which accommodates noisy measurements and integrates them into control decisions through a Bayesian update mechanism. We characterize the control optimality in terms of a sequence of interlaced Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equations coupled with controlled impulse steps at the measurement times. For the case of Gaussian-controlled processes, we derive an equivalent HJB equation whose state variable is finite-dimensional, namely the state's mean and covariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through numerical examples. These include control under perfect observations, control under no observations, and control under noisy observations. Our numerical results highlight significant differences in the control strategies and their performance, emphasizing the challenges and computational demands of dealing with uncertainty in state observation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Superlinear Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed optimization problems, where each agent cooperatively minimizes the sum of local objective functions through the communication with its neighbors. The widely adopted distributed gradient method in solving this problem suffers from slow convergence rates, which motivates us to incorporate the second-order information of the objective functions. However, the challenge arises from the unique structure of the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which prevents the direct distributed implementation of the second-order method. We overcome this challenge by proposing a novel optimization framework. The key idea is to transform the distributed optimization problem into an optimal control problem. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle and the associated forward-backward difference equations (FBDEs), we derive a new distributed optimization algorithm that incorporates the second-order information without requiring the computation of the inverse of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the superlinear convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved under some mild assumptions. Finally, we also propose a variant of the algorithm to balance the number of iterations and communication.</description>

      <title>Low-regret shape optimization in the presence of missing Dirichlet data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shape optimization problem subject to an elliptic equation in the presence of missing data on the Dirichlet boundary condition is considered. It is formulated by optimizing the deformation field that varies the spatial domain where the Poisson equation is posed. To take into consideration the missing boundary data the problem is formulated as a no-regret problem and approximated by low-regret problems. This approach allows to obtain deformation fields which are robust against the missing information. The formulation of the regret problems was achieved by employing the Fenchel transform. Convergence of the solutions of the low-regret to the no-regret problems is analysed, the gradient of the cost is characterized and a first order numerical method is proposed. Numerical examples illustrate the robustness of the low-regret deformation fields with respect to missing data. This is likely the first time that a numerical investigation is reported on for the level of effectiveness of the low-regret approach in the presence of missing data in an optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Computational Aspects of Lifted Cover Inequalities for Knapsacks with Few Different Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cutting planes are frequently used for solving integer programs. A common strategy is to derive cutting planes from building blocks or a substructure of the integer program. In this paper, we focus on knapsack constraints that arise from single row relaxations. Among the most popular classes derived from knapsack constraints are lifted minimal cover inequalities. The separation problem for these inequalities is NP-hard though, and one usually separates them heuristically, therefore not fully exploiting their potential. For many benchmarking instances however, it turns out that many knapsack constraints only have few different coefficients. This motivates the concept of sparse knapsacks where the number of different coefficients is a small constant, independent of the number of variables present. For such knapsacks, we observe that there are only polynomially many different classes of structurally equivalent minimal covers. This opens the door to specialized techniques for using lifted minimal cover inequalities. In this article we will discuss two such techniques, which are based on specialized sorting methods. On the one hand, we present new separation routines that separate equivalence classes of inequalities rather than individual inequalities. On the other hand, we derive compact extended formulations that express all lifted minimal cover inequalities by means of a polynomial number of constraints. These extended formulations are based on tailored sorting networks that express our separation algorithm by linear inequalities. We conclude the article by a numerical investigation of the different techniques for popular benchmarking instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an approximate controllability problem for the continuity equation and its application to constructing transport maps with normalizing flows. Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the vector field $x\mapsto w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space of the continuity equation in relative entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate stochastic versions of the Hopf-Lax formula which are based on compositions of the Hopf-Lax operator with the transition kernel of a L\'evy process taking values in a separable Banach space. We show that, depending on the order of the composition, one obtains upper and lower bounds for the value function of a stochastic optimal control problem associated to the drift controlled L\'evy dynamics. Dynamic consistency is restored by iterating the resulting operators. Moreover, the value function of the control problem is approximated both from above and below as the number of iterations tends to infinity, and we provide explicit convergence rates and guarantees for the approximation procedure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic reinsurance design with heterogeneous beliefs under the mean-variance framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the mean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the insurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility constraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled using the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in a risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, we apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one determined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance contracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss contracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous beliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive the parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution. Finally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer share identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is relaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief heterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of ensemble optimal control to derive enhanced strategies for pharmacological cancer treatment. In particular, we focus on moving beyond the classical clinical approach of giving the patient the maximal tolerated drug dose (MTD), which does not properly exploit the fight among sensitive and resistant cells for the available resources. Here, we employ a Lotka-Volterra model to describe the two competing subpopulations, and we enclose this system within the ensemble control framework. In the first part, we establish general results suitable for application to various solid cancers. Then, we carry out numerical simulations in the setting of prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, yielding a computed policy that is reminiscent of the medical 'active surveillance' paradigm. Finally, inspired by the numerical evidence, we propose a variant of the celebrated adaptive therapy (AT), which we call 'Off-On' AT.</description>

      <title>QOCO: A Quadratic Objective Conic Optimizer with Custom Solver Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order cone programs (SOCPs) with quadratic objective functions are common in optimal control and other fields. Most SOCP solvers which use interior-point methods are designed for linear objectives and convert quadratic objectives into linear ones via slack variables and extra constraints, despite the computational advantages of handling quadratic objectives directly. In applications like model-predictive control and online trajectory optimization, these SOCPs have known sparsity structures and require rapid solutions. When solving these problems, most solvers use sparse linear algebra routines, which introduce computational overhead and hinder performance. In contrast, custom linear algebra routines can exploit the known sparsity structure of problem data and be significantly faster. This work makes two key contributions: (1) the development of QOCO, an open-source C-based solver for quadratic objective SOCPs, and (2) the introduction of QOCOGEN, an open-source custom solver generator for quadratic objective SOCPs, which generates a solver written in C that leverages custom linear algebra. Both implement a primal-dual interior-point method with Mehrotra's predictor-corrector. Our benchmarks show that QOCO is faster and more robust than many commonly used solvers, and solvers generated by QOCOGEN are significantly faster than QOCO and are free of dynamic memory allocation making them an attractive option for real-time optimization on resource-constrained embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Compressed Zeroth-Order Algorithm for Stochastic Distributed Nonconvex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the stochastic distributed nonconvex optimization problem over a network of agents, where agents only access stochastic zeroth-order information about their local cost functions and collaboratively optimize the global objective over bandwidth-limited communication networks. To mitigate communication overhead and handle the unavailability of explicit gradient information, we propose a communication compressed zeroth-order stochastic distributed (CZSD) algorithm. By integrating a generalized contractive compressor and a stochastic two-point zeroth-order oracle, CZSD achieves convergence rates comparable to its exact communication counterpart while reducing both communication overhead and sampling complexity. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, CZSD is the first compressed zeroth-order algorithm achieving linear speedup, with convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p}/\sqrt{nT})$ and $\mathcal{O}(p/(nT))$ under general nonconvex settings and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz condition, respectively. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm's effectiveness and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Variational Inequality Problem for Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Selection of Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium selection problem in the variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (v-GNEP) has been reported as an optimization problem defined over the solution set of v-GNEP, called in this paper the lower-level v-GNEP. However, to make such a selection fair for every player, we have to rely on an unrealistic assumption, that is, the availability of a trusted center that does not induce any bias among players. In this paper, to ensure fairness for every player even in the process of equilibrium selection, we propose a new equilibrium selection problem, named the upper-level v-GNEP. The proposed upper-level v-GNEP is formulated as a v-GNEP defined over the solution set of the lower-level v-GNEP. We also present an iterative algorithm, of guaranteed convergence to a solution of the upper-level v-GNEP, as an application of the hybrid steepest descent method to a fixed point set characterization of the solution of the lower-level v-GNEP. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed equilibrium selection and algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step sizes have a profound impact on gradient descent methods. In this work, we propose two new gradient step sizes: one longer than the original long BB step size, and the other shorter than the original short BB step size. This extends the bounds of the original BB step sizes. For strictly convex quadratic optimization problems, we employ the dynamics of difference equations to prove that these two new methods achieve R-linear convergence. Regarding stability, we surprisingly find that under certain conditions, the gradient descent method corresponding to the longer step size is stable, whereas the shorter step size consistently leads to instability. Numerical results validate these stability theories. Here, stability refers to whether the gradient norm decreases monotonically.</description>

      <title>Stability-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow--A Gaussian Process-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem is a core task in power system operations, aimed at determining cost-effective generation dispatch while satisfying physical and operational constraints. However, conventional ACOPF formulations rely on steady-state models and neglect the dynamic behavior of generators, which can lead to operating points that are economically optimal but dynamically unstable. This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach to incorporate generator dynamics into the ACOPF using Gaussian Process (GP) models. Specifically, it introduces an exponential surrogate function to characterize the stability of solutions to the differential equations governing synchronous generator dynamics. The exponent, which indicates whether system trajectories decay (stable) or grow (unstable), is learned as a function of the bus voltage using GP regression. Crucially, the framework enables probabilistic stability assessment to be integrated directly into the optimization process. The resulting dynamics-aware ACOPF formulation identifies operating points that satisfy both operational safety and dynamic stability criteria. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 39-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently captures generator dynamics using limited training data, leading to more reliable and robust decisions across a wide range of operating conditions.</description>

Abstract: The logistical challenges and high costs associated with procuring and transporting fuel to remote military bases underscore the need for sustainable and resilient energy solutions. Integrating renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into military microgrids offers a promising approach to enhance energy security and operational readiness. This paper explores the optimization of travel, charging, and discharging schedules for a fleet of military electric trucks, aiming to minimize reliance on fuel-generated electricity while ensuring that mission-critical transportation needs are met. We extend the classical Vehicle Scheduling Problem by incorporating Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem dynamics and Vehicle-to-Grid capabilities, developing a comprehensive optimization model that addresses both logistical and energy demands within a military microgrid context. Utilizing a column generation approach, we efficiently solve large-scale instances and demonstrate significant improvements in fuel efficiency, renewable energy utilization, and overall operational cost. Computational experiments using realistic demand and solar generation data illustrate that integration of vehicle-to-grid enabled electric vehicles substantially reduces fuel consumption and can generate surplus energy returned to the grid. The results indicate that while battery constraints may require an increased fleet size, strategic scheduling of charging and discharging yields considerable economic and operational benefits. Our findings provide valuable insights for planners aiming to optimize energy use, reduce dependence on traditional fuel sources, and enhance operational resilience in remote environments.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Filter Kernels and Robustness to Incorrect Transition and Measurement Kernel Perturbations in Partially Observable Stochastic Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the stability of partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with respect to perturbations in either transition or observation kernels is a mathematically and practically important problem. While asymptotic robustness/stability results showing that as approximate transition kernels and/or measurement kernels converge to the true ones in appropriate senses have been previously reported, explicit and uniform bounds on value differences and mismatch costs have not been studied to our knowledge. In this paper, we provide such explicit bounds under both discounted and average cost criteria. The bounds are given in terms of Wasserstein and total variation distances between the original and approximate transition kernels, and total variation distances between observation channels. In particular, we show that control policies optimized for approximate models yield performance guarantees when applied to the true model with explicit bounds. As a particular application, we consider the case where the state space and the measurement spaces are quantized to obtain finite models, and we obtain explicit error bounds which decay to zero as the approximations get finer. This provides explicit performance guarantees for model reduction in POMDPs.</description>

      <title>Variational Optimization for Quantum Problems using Deep Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization drives advances in quantum science and machine learning, yet most generative models aim to mimic data rather than to discover optimal answers to challenging problems. Here we present a variational generative optimization network that learns to map simple random inputs into high quality solutions across a variety of quantum tasks. We demonstrate that the network rapidly identifies entangled states exhibiting an optimal advantage in entanglement detection when allowing classical communication, attains the ground state energy of an eighteen spin model without encountering the barren plateau phenomenon that hampers standard hybrid algorithms, and-after a single training run-outputs multiple orthogonal ground states of degenerate quantum models. Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Computation sequential Monte Carlo via random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a popular inference method when likelihoods are hard to come by. Practical bottlenecks of ABC applications include selecting statistics that summarize the data without losing too much information or introducing uncertainty, and choosing distance functions and tolerance thresholds that balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have shown that ABC methods using random forest (RF) methodology perform well while circumventing many of ABC's drawbacks. However, RF construction is computationally expensive for large numbers of trees and model simulations, and there can be high uncertainty in the posterior if the prior distribution is uninformative. Here we further adapt random forests to the ABC setting in two ways. The first exploits distributional random forests to provide a direct method for inferring the joint posterior distribution of parameters of interest, while the second describes a sequential Monte Carlo approach which updates the prior distribution iteratively to focus on the most likely regions in the parameter space. We show that the new methods can accurately infer posterior distributions for a wide range of deterministic and stochastic models in different scientific areas.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Robot Action Planning in the Presence of Unconcerned Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Gossip Algorithms for Approximate Quantile and Mean Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents gossip algorithms for aggregation tasks that demonstrate both robustness to adversarial corruptions of any order of magnitude and optimality across a substantial range of these corruption levels. Gossip algorithms distribute information in a scalable and efficient way by having random pairs of nodes exchange small messages. Value aggregation problems are of particular interest in this setting, as they occur frequently in practice, and many elegant algorithms have been proposed for computing aggregates and statistics such as averages and quantiles. An important and well-studied advantage of gossip algorithms is their robustness to message delays, network churn, and unreliable message transmissions. However, these crucial robustness guarantees only hold if all nodes follow the protocol and no messages are corrupted. In this paper, we remedy this by providing a framework to model both adversarial participants and message corruptions in gossip-style communications by allowing an adversary to control a small fraction of the nodes or corrupt messages arbitrarily. Despite this very powerful and general corruption model, we show that robust gossip algorithms can be designed for many important aggregation problems. Our algorithms guarantee that almost all nodes converge to an approximately correct answer with optimal efficiency and essentially as fast as without corruptions. The design of adversarially-robust gossip algorithms poses completely new challenges. Despite this, our algorithms remain very simple variations of known non-robust algorithms with often only subtle changes to avoid non-compliant nodes gaining too much influence over outcomes. While our algorithms remain simple, their analysis is much more complex and often requires a completely different approach than the non-adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems under stringent state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints is challenging. In contrast to existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed approach uses smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions are derived pertaining to the minimum control authority, the maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions, illuminating the narrow operating domain of EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using experimental and comparison studies.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized polymatroids. This implies $\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form $\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight (2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and upper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular ASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Two-Instrument Screening under Soft Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study soft budget constraints in multi-tier public finance when an upper-tier government uses two instruments: an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post rescue. Under convex rescue costs and standard primitives, the three-stage leader-follower problem collapses to one dimensional screening with a single allocation index: the cap on realized rescue. A hazard-based characterization delivers a unified rule that nests (i) no rescue, (ii) a threshold-cap with commitment, and (iii) a threshold--linear--cap without commitment. The knife-edge for eliminating bailouts compares the marginal cost at the origin to the supremum of a virtual weight, and the comparative statics show how greater curvature tightens caps while discretion shifts transfers toward front loading by lowering the effective grant weight. The framework provides a portable benchmark for mechanism design and yields testable implications for policy and empirical work on intergovernmental finance.</description>
