      <title>Counteracting Duration Bias in Video Recommendation via Counterfactual Watch Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In video recommendation, an ongoing effort is to satisfy users' personalized information needs by leveraging their logged watch time. However, watch time prediction suffers from duration bias, hindering its ability to reflect users' interests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover user interests through grouping and normalizing observed watch time according to video duration. Although effective to some extent, we found that these approaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watches the entire video) as equally high interest, which deviates from what we observed on real datasets: users have varied explicit feedback proportion when completely playing videos. In this paper, we introduce the counterfactual watch time(CWT), the potential watch time a user would spend on the video if its duration is sufficiently long. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the truncation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usually occurs on those completely played records. Besides, a Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) is proposed, revealing that CWT equals the time users get the maximum benefit from video recommender systems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined to transform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and the model can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function defined over observed user watch times. Extensive experiments on three real video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing demonstrated that CWM effectively enhanced video recommendation accuracy and counteracted the duration bias.</description>

      <title>A Self-boosted Framework for Calibrated Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-calibrated ranking systems are ubiquitous in real-world applications nowadays, which pursue accurate ranking quality and calibrated probabilistic predictions simultaneously. For instance, in the advertising ranking system, the predicted click-through rate (CTR) is utilized for ranking and required to be calibrated for the downstream cost-per-click ads bidding. Recently, multi-objective based methods have been wildly adopted as a standard approach for Calibrated Ranking, which incorporates the combination of two loss functions: a pointwise loss that focuses on calibrated absolute values and a ranking loss that emphasizes relative orderings. However, when applied to industrial online applications, existing multi-objective CR approaches still suffer from two crucial limitations. First, previous methods need to aggregate the full candidate list within a single mini-batch to compute the ranking loss. Such aggregation strategy violates extensive data shuffling which has long been proven beneficial for preventing overfitting, and thus degrades the training effectiveness. Second, existing multi-objective methods apply the two inherently conflicting loss functions on a single probabilistic prediction, which results in a sub-optimal trade-off between calibration and ranking. To tackle the two limitations, we propose a Self-Boosted framework for Calibrated Ranking (SBCR).</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Realisation of an Information Need: An EEG Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5\% (SD 2.6\%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1\% (SD 22.1\%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</description>

      <title>Graph Bottlenecked Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of social networks, social recommendation has become an essential technique for personalized services. Recently, graph-based social recommendations have shown promising results by capturing the high-order social influence. Most empirical studies of graph-based social recommendations directly take the observed social networks into formulation, and produce user preferences based on social homogeneity. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that social networks in the real-world are inevitably noisy~(existing redundant social relations), which may obstruct precise user preference characterization. Nevertheless, identifying and removing redundant social relations is challenging due to a lack of labels. In this paper, we focus on learning the denoised social structure to facilitate recommendation tasks from an information bottleneck perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Graph Bottlenecked Social Recommendation (GBSR) framework to tackle the social noise issue.GBSR is a model-agnostic social denoising framework, that aims to maximize the mutual information between the denoised social graph and recommendation labels, meanwhile minimizing it between the denoised social graph and the original one. This enables GBSR to learn the minimal yet sufficient social structure, effectively reducing redundant social relations and enhancing social recommendations. Technically, GBSR consists of two elaborate components, preference-guided social graph refinement, and HSIC-based bottleneck learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GBSR, including high performances and good generality combined with various backbones. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yimutianyang/KDD24-GBSR.</description>

      <title>GPT4Rec: Graph Prompt Tuning for Streaming Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of personalized recommender systems, the challenge of adapting to evolving user preferences and the continuous influx of new users and items is paramount. Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Boosting Multimedia Recommendation via Separate Generic and Unique Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimedia recommendation, which incorporates various modalities (e.g., images, texts, etc.) into user or item representation to improve recommendation quality, has received widespread attention. Recent methods mainly focus on cross-modal alignment with self-supervised learning to obtain higher quality representation. Despite remarkable performance, we argue that there is still a limitation: completely aligning representation undermines modality-unique information. We consider that cross-modal alignment is right, but it should not be the entirety, as different modalities contain generic information between them, and each modality also contains unique information. Simply aligning each modality may ignore modality-unique features, thus degrading the performance of multimedia recommendation. To tackle the above limitation, we propose a Separate Alignment aNd Distancing framework (SAND) for multimedia recommendation, which concurrently learns both modal-unique and -generic representation to achieve more comprehensive items representation. First, we split each modal feature into generic and unique part. Then, in the alignment module, for better integration of semantic information between different modalities , we design a SoloSimLoss to align generic modalities. Furthermore, in the distancing module, we aim to distance the unique modalities from the modal-generic so that each modality retains its unique and complementary information. In the light of the flexibility of our framework, we give two technical solutions, the more capable mutual information minimization and the simple negative l2 distance. Finally, extensive experimental results on three popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Wiki Entity Summarization Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity summarization aims to compute concise summaries for entities in knowledge graphs. Existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to a few hundred entities and discard graph structure in source knowledge graphs. This limitation is particularly pronounced when it comes to ground-truth summaries, where there exist only a few labeled summaries for evaluation and training. We propose WikES, a comprehensive benchmark comprising of entities, their summaries, and their connections. Additionally, WikES features a dataset generator to test entity summarization algorithms in different areas of the knowledge graph. Importantly, our approach combines graph algorithms and NLP models as well as different data sources such that WikES does not require human annotation, rendering the approach cost-effective and generalizable to multiple domains. Finally, WikES is scalable and capable of capturing the complexities of knowledge graphs in terms of topology and semantics. WikES features existing datasets for comparison. Empirical studies of entity summarization methods confirm the usefulness of our benchmark. Data, code, and models are available at: https://github.com/msorkhpar/wiki-entity-summarization.</description>

      <title>Improving LLMs for Recommendation with Out-Of-Vocabulary Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing users and items through vector representations is crucial for various tasks in recommender systems. Recent approaches attempt to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommendation through a question and answer format, where real users and items (e.g., Item No.2024) are represented with in-vocabulary tokens (e.g., "item", "20", "24"). However, since LLMs are typically pretrained on natural language tasks, these in-vocabulary tokens lack the expressive power for distinctive users and items, thereby weakening the recommendation ability even after fine-tuning on recommendation tasks. In this paper, we explore how to effectively tokenize users and items in LLM-based recommender systems. We emphasize the role of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens in addition to the in-vocabulary ones and claim the memorization of OOV tokens that capture correlations of users/items as well as diversity of OOV tokens. By clustering the learned representations from historical user-item interactions, we make the representations of user/item combinations share the same OOV tokens if they have similar properties. Furthermore, integrating these OOV tokens into the LLM's vocabulary allows for better distinction between users and items and enhanced capture of user-item relationships during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Our proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various downstream recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>"It answers questions that I didn't know I had": Ph.D. Students' Evaluation of an Information Sharing Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available, it is scattered across university's websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query, and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. We propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision making, especially when choosing collaborators in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring student faculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data, and insights into crowdsourced fellow students' activities. The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally.</description>

      <title>DeTriever: Decoder-representation-based Retriever for Improving NL2SQL In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in-context Learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective technique to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a variety of complex tasks, notably in translating natural language questions into Structured Query Language (NL2SQL), the question of how to select the most beneficial demonstration examples remains an open research problem. While prior works often adapted off-the-shelf encoders to retrieve examples dynamically, an inherent discrepancy exists in the representational capacities between the external retrievers and the LLMs. Further, optimizing the selection of examples is a non-trivial task, since there are no straightforward methods to assess the relative benefits of examples without performing pairwise inference. To address these shortcomings, we propose DeTriever, a novel demonstration retrieval framework that learns a weighted combination of LLM hidden states, where rich semantic information is encoded. To train the model, we propose a proxy score that estimates the relative benefits of examples based on the similarities between output queries. Experiments on two popular NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on one-shot NL2SQL tasks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unravelling Local Government Data Sharing Barriers in Estonia and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estonia's digital government success has received global acclaim, yet its Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives, especially at the local level, encounter persistent challenges. Despite significant progress of national OGD initiative in OGD rankings, local governments lag in OGD provision. This study aims to examine barriers hindering municipalities from openly sharing OGD. Employing a qualitative approach through interviews with Estonian municipalities and drawing on the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model, the study sheds light on barriers impeding OGD sharing. Practical recommendations are proposed to bridge the gap between national policies and local implementation, including enhancing awareness, improving data governance frameworks, and fostering collaboration be-tween local and national authorities. By addressing overlooked weaknesses in the Estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. Additionally, by validating the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. Ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local OGD initiatives.</description>

      <title>On (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain as an Off-Policy Evaluation Metric for Top-$n$ Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaches to recommendation are typically evaluated in one of two ways: (1) via a (simulated) online experiment, often seen as the gold standard, or (2) via some offline evaluation procedure, where the goal is to approximate the outcome of an online experiment. Several offline evaluation metrics have been adopted in the literature, inspired by ranking metrics prevalent in the field of Information Retrieval. (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is one such metric that has seen widespread adoption in empirical studies, and higher (n)DCG values have been used to present new methods as the state-of-the-art in top-$n$ recommendation for many years.
  Our work takes a critical look at this approach, and investigates when we can expect such metrics to approximate the gold standard outcome of an online experiment. We formally present the assumptions that are necessary to consider DCG an unbiased estimator of online reward and provide a derivation for this metric from first principles, highlighting where we deviate from its traditional uses in IR. Importantly, we show that normalising the metric renders it inconsistent, in that even when DCG is unbiased, ranking competing methods by their normalised DCG can invert their relative order. Through a correlation analysis between off- and on-line experiments conducted on a large-scale recommendation platform, we show that our unbiased DCG estimates strongly correlate with online reward, even when some of the metric's inherent assumptions are violated. This statement no longer holds for its normalised variant, suggesting that nDCG's practical utility may be limited.</description>

      <title>MARVEL: Unlocking the Multi-Modal Capability of Dense Retrieval via Visual Module Plugin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes Multi-modAl Retrieval model via Visual modulE pLugin (MARVEL), which learns an embedding space for queries and multi-modal documents to conduct retrieval. MARVEL encodes queries and multi-modal documents with a unified encoder model, which helps to alleviate the modality gap between images and texts. Specifically, we enable the image understanding ability of the well-trained dense retriever, T5-ANCE, by incorporating the visual module's encoded image features as its inputs. To facilitate the multi-modal retrieval tasks, we build the ClueWeb22-MM dataset based on the ClueWeb22 dataset, which regards anchor texts as queries, and extracts the related text and image documents from anchor-linked web pages. Our experiments show that MARVEL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the multi-modal retrieval dataset WebQA and ClueWeb22-MM. MARVEL provides an opportunity to broaden the advantages of text retrieval to the multi-modal scenario. Besides, we also illustrate that the language model has the ability to extract image semantics and partly map the image features to the input word embedding space. All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/MARVEL.</description>

      <title>CDRNP: Cross-Domain Recommendation to Cold-Start Users via Neural Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to tackle the user cold-start problem, which aims to make recommendations for users in the target domain by transferring the user preference derived from the source domain. Traditional CDR studies follow the embedding and mapping (EMCDR) paradigm, which transfers user representations from the source to target domain by learning a user-shared mapping function, neglecting the user-specific preference. Recent CDR studies attempt to learn user-specific mapping functions in meta-learning paradigm, which regards each user's CDR as an individual task, but neglects the preference correlations among users, limiting the beneficial information for user representations. Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios.</description>

      <title>CaseLink: Inductive Graph Learning for Legal Case Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17780</link>

Abstract: In case law, the precedents are the relevant cases that are used to support the decisions made by the judges and the opinions of lawyers towards a given case. This relevance is referred to as the case-to-case reference relation. To efficiently find relevant cases from a large case pool, retrieval tools are widely used by legal practitioners. Existing legal case retrieval models mainly work by comparing the text representations of individual cases. Although they obtain a decent retrieval accuracy, the intrinsic case connectivity relationships among cases have not been well exploited for case encoding, therefore limiting the further improvement of retrieval performance. In a case pool, there are three types of case connectivity relationships: the case reference relationship, the case semantic relationship, and the case legal charge relationship. Due to the inductive manner in the task of legal case retrieval, using case reference as input is not applicable for testing. Thus, in this paper, a CaseLink model based on inductive graph learning is proposed to utilise the intrinsic case connectivity for legal case retrieval, a novel Global Case Graph is incorporated to represent both the case semantic relationship and the case legal charge relationship. A novel contrastive objective with a regularisation on the degree of case nodes is proposed to leverage the information carried by the case reference relationship to optimise the model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CaseLink. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/CaseLink.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Rankers Trained on Expanded Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important problem in text-ranking systems is handling the hard queries that form the tail end of the query distribution. The difficulty may arise due to the presence of uncommon, underspecified, or incomplete queries. In this work, we improve the ranking performance of hard or difficult queries without compromising the performance of other queries. Firstly, we do LLM based query enrichment for training queries using relevant documents. Next, a specialized ranker is fine-tuned only on the enriched hard queries instead of the original queries. We combine the relevance scores from the specialized ranker and the base ranker, along with a query performance score estimated for each query. Our approach departs from existing methods that usually employ a single ranker for all queries, which is biased towards easy queries, which form the majority of the query distribution. In our extensive experiments on the DL-Hard dataset, we find that a principled query performance based scoring method using base and specialized ranker offers a significant improvement of up to 25% on the passage ranking task and up to 48.4% on the document ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using original queries, even outperforming SOTA model.</description>

      <title>A Unified Search and Recommendation Framework Based on Multi-Scenario Learning for Ranking in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search and recommendation (S&amp;R) are the two most important scenarios in e-commerce. The majority of users typically interact with products in S&amp;R scenarios, indicating the need and potential for joint modeling. Traditional multi-scenario models use shared parameters to learn the similarity of multiple tasks, and task-specific parameters to learn the divergence of individual tasks. This coarse-grained modeling approach does not effectively capture the differences between S&amp;R scenarios. Furthermore, this approach does not sufficiently exploit the information across the global label space. These issues can result in the suboptimal performance of multi-scenario models in handling both S&amp;R scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an effective and universal framework for Unified Search and Recommendation (USR), designed with S&amp;R Views User Interest Extractor Layer (IE) and S&amp;R Views Feature Generator Layer (FG) to separately generate user interests and scenario-agnostic feature representations for S&amp;R. Next, we introduce a Global Label Space Multi-Task Layer (GLMT) that uses global labels as supervised signals of auxiliary tasks and jointly models the main task and auxiliary tasks using conditional probability. Extensive experimental evaluations on real-world industrial datasets show that USR can be applied to various multi-scenario models and significantly improve their performance. Online A/B testing also indicates substantial performance gains across multiple metrics. Currently, USR has been successfully deployed in the 7Fresh App.</description>

      <title>Are Word Embedding Methods Stable and Should We Care About It?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A representation learning method is considered stable if it consistently generates similar representation of the given data across multiple runs. Word Embedding Methods (WEMs) are a class of representation learning methods that generate dense vector representation for each word in the given text data. The central idea of this paper is to explore the stability measurement of WEMs using intrinsic evaluation based on word similarity. We experiment with three popular WEMs: Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. For stability measurement, we investigate the effect of five parameters involved in training these models. We perform experiments using four real-world datasets from different domains: Wikipedia, News, Song lyrics, and European parliament proceedings. We also observe the effect of WEM stability on three downstream tasks: Clustering, POS tagging, and Fairness evaluation. Our experiments indicate that amongst the three WEMs, fastText is the most stable, followed by GloVe and Word2Vec.</description>

      <title>CoopHash: Cooperative Learning of Multipurpose Descriptor and Contrastive Pair Generator via Variational MCMC Teaching for Supervised Image Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost performance is to employ generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However, GAN-based methods are difficult to train, which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the generative cooperative hashing network, which is based on energy-based cooperative learning. This framework jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function via two components: a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives, including probability density, hash code, latent code, and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods, achieving up to 10\% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods, and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval.</description>

      <title>A smoothed-Bayesian approach to frequency recovery from sketched data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel statistical perspective on a classical problem at the intersection of computer science and information theory: recovering the empirical frequency of a symbol in a large discrete dataset using only a compressed representation, or sketch, obtained via random hashing. Departing from traditional algorithmic approaches, recent works have proposed Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) methods that can provide more informative frequency estimates by leveraging modeling assumptions about the distribution of the sketched data. In this paper, we propose a {\em smoothed-Bayesian} method, inspired by existing BNP approaches but designed in a frequentist framework to overcome the computational limitations of the BNP approaches when dealing with large-scale data from realistic distributions, including those with power-law tail behaviors. For sketches obtained with a single hash function, our approach is supported by rigorous frequentist properties, including unbiasedness and optimality under a squared error loss function within an intuitive class of linear estimators. For sketches with multiple hash functions, we introduce an approach based on \emph{multi-view} learning to construct computationally efficient frequency estimators. We validate our method on synthetic and real data, comparing its performance to that of existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Information Refinement Training of Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating additional information from retrieval. However, studies have shown that LLMs still face challenges in effectively using the retrieved information, even ignoring it or being misled by it. The key reason is that the training of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input retrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as ``Information Refiner'', which means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of retrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved texts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise, accurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an information refinement training method named InFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in an unsupervised manner. InFO-RAG is low-cost and general across various tasks. Extensive experiments on zero-shot prediction of 11 datasets in diverse tasks including Question Answering, Slot-Filling, Language Modeling, Dialogue, and Code Generation show that InFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an average of 9.39\% relative points. InFO-RAG also shows advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG.</description>

      <title>General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There remain numerous unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL) within the classical learning theory framework. These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.</description>
