      <title>Wronskians form the inverse system of the arcs of a double point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal of the arc scheme of a double point or, equivalently, the differential ideal generated by the ideal of a double point is a primary ideal in an infinite-dimensional polynomial ring supported at the origin. This ideal has a rich combinatorial structure connecting it to singularity theory, partition identities, representation theory, and differential algebra. Macaulay inverse system is a powerful tool for studying the structure of primary ideals which describes an ideal in terms of certain linear differential operators. In the present paper, we show that the inverse system of the ideal of the arc scheme of a double point is precisely a vector space spanned by all the Wronskians of the variables and their formal derivatives. We then apply this characterization to extend our recent result on Poincar\'e-type series for such ideals.</description>

      <title>Bistellar Cluster Algebras and Piecewise Linear Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the ideas and techniques used in the study of cluster algebras we construct a new class of algebras, called bistellar cluster algebras, from closed oriented triangulated even-dimensional manifolds by performing middle-dimensional bistellar moves. This class of algebras exhibit the algebraic behaviour of middle-dimensional bistellar moves but do not satisfy the classical cluster algebra axiom: "every cluster variable in every cluster is exchangeable". Thus the construction of bistellar cluster algebras is quite different from that of a classical cluster algebra. Secondly, using bistellar cluster algebras and the techniques of combinatorial topology, we construct a direct system associated with a set of PL homeomorphic PL manifolds of dimension 2 or 4, and show that the limit of this direct system is a PL invariant.</description>

      <title>Learning functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds via lightweight invariant features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical formulation for machine learning of (1) functions on symmetric matrices that are invariant with respect to the action of permutations by conjugation, and (2) functions on point clouds that are invariant with respect to rotations, reflections, and permutations of the points. To achieve this, we construct $O(n^2)$ invariant features derived from generators for the field of rational functions on $n\times n$ symmetric matrices that are invariant under joint permutations of rows and columns. We show that these invariant features can separate all distinct orbits of symmetric matrices except for a measure zero set; such features can be used to universally approximate invariant functions on almost all weighted graphs. For point clouds in a fixed dimension, we prove that the number of invariant features can be reduced, generically without losing expressivity, to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points. We combine these invariant features with DeepSets to learn functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds with varying sizes. We empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on molecule property regression and point cloud distance prediction.</description>
