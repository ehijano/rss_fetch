      <title>One-sided Davis inequality for (F4) filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Davis inequality $\mathbb{E} Mf\simeq \mathbb{E} Sf$, where $(Sf)^2=\sum_{k}\left|f_{k}-f_{k-1}\right|^2$ is the square function and $Mf= \sup_n \left|f_n\right|$ is the maximal function, is true with a universal constant for any martingale $f$ on any filtration. A natural analog in the setting of (F4) doubly indexed filtrations, i.e. $\left(\mathcal{F}_{i,j}\right)_{i,j}$ such that the operators $\mathbb{E}\left(\cdot\mid \mathcal{F}_{i,\infty}\right)$ and $\mathbb{E}\left(\cdot\mid \mathcal{F}_{\infty,j}\right)$ commute and their product is $\mathbb{E}\left(\cdot\mid \mathcal{F}_{i,j}\right)$, is the conjecture \[\mathbb{E}\sup_{n,m} \left|f_{n,m}\right|\simeq\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{i,j}\left|\Delta f_{i,j}\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2},\] where $\Delta f_{i,j}=f_{i,j}-f_{i-1,j}-f_{i,j-1}+f_{i-1,j-1}$. It was known to be true only with some highly restrictive additional assumptions, e.g. regularity of the filtration ($g_{n,m}\gtrsim g_{n+1,m},g_{n,m+1}$ for any positive martingale $g$) or $f$ being a strong martingale ($\mathbb{E}\left(\Delta f_{i,j}\mid \mathcal{F}_{i-1,j}\vee \mathcal{F}_{i,j-1}\right)=0$). We prove the inequality $\lesssim $ assuming just the (F4) condition.</description>

      <title>Covering of an inner subset by the confined random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk conditioned to stay forever in a finite domain $D_N \subset \mathbb{Z}^d, d \geq 3$ of typical size $N$. This confined walk is a random walk on the conductances given by the first eigenvector of the Laplacian on $D_N$. On inner sets of $D_N$, the trace of this confined walk can be approximated by tilted random interlacements, which is a useful tool to understand some properties of the walk.
  In this paper, we propose to study the cover time of inner subsets $\Lambda_N$ of $D_N$ as well as the so-called late points of these subsets. If $\Lambda_N$ contains enough late points, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the covering time as $c_\Lambda N^d \big[ \log N - \log\log N + \mathcal{G} \big]$, with $\mathcal{G}$ a Gumbel random variable, as well as a Poisson repartition of these late points. The method we use is similar to Belius' work about the simple random walk on the torus, which displays the same asymptotics albeit without the $\log \log N$ term. In the more general setting of ``ball-like'' $\Lambda_N$, we simply get the first term of the asymptotic expansion.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solutions to SDEs with state-dependent variable exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-inhomogeneous, nonlinear stochastic differential equation whose drift and diffusion terms involve state-dependent variable exponents. This novel structure introduces flexibility, allowing the system to adapt dynamically to its current state and better capture real-world phenomena compared to classical models such as GBM and CEV. While this flexibility enhances modeling accuracy, it also creates analytical challenges. Using a fixed-point approach, we establish existence and uniqueness under suitable conditions. The model generalizes GBM and CEV while exhibiting distinct behavior for small states.</description>

      <title>Towards a characterization of elliptic Harnack inequality for jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an isotropic unimodal L\'{e}vy jump process on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We develop probabilistic methods which in many cases allow us to determine whether $X$ satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality (EHI), by looking only at the jump kernel of $X$, and its truncated second moments. Both our positive results and our negative results can be applied to subordinated Brownian motions (SBMs) in particular. We produce the first known example of an SBM that does \textit{not} satisfy EHI. We show that for many SBMs that were previously known to satisfy EHI (such as the geometric stable process, the iterated geometric stable process, and the relativistic geometric stable process), bounded perturbations of them also satisfy EHI (which was not previously clear). We show that certain SBMs with Laplace exponent $\phi(\lambda) = \tilde{\Omega}(\lambda)$ satisfy EHI, which previous methods were unable to determine.</description>

      <title>Moderate-to-large deviation asymptotics for real eigenvalues of the elliptic Ginibre matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of the number of real eigenvalues in the elliptic deformation of the real Ginibre ensemble. As the matrix dimension grows, the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the number of real eigenvalues are well understood, but the probabilities of rare events remain largely unexplored. Large deviation type results have been obtained only in extreme cases, when either a vanishingly small proportion of eigenvalues are real or almost all eigenvalues are real. Here, in both the strong and weak asymmetry regimes, we derive the probabilities of rare events in the moderate-to-large deviation regime, thereby providing a natural connection between the previously known regime of Gaussian fluctuations and the large deviation regime. Our results are new even for the classical real Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Weak conditional propagation of chaos for systems of interacting particles with nearly stable jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ interacting particles, described by SDEs driven by Poisson random measures, where the coefficients depend on the empirical measure of the system. Every particle jumps with a jump rate depending on its position. When this happens, all the other particles of the system receive a small random kick which is distributed according to a heavy-tailed random variable belonging to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law and scaled by $N^{-1/\alpha},$ where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. We call these jumps collateral jumps. Moreover, in case $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, the jumping particle itself undergoes a macroscopic, main jump. Such systems appear in the modeling of large neural networks, such as the human brain. Using a representation of the collateral jump sum as a time-changed random walk, we prove the convergence in law, in Skorokhod space, of this system to a limit infinite-exchangeable system of SDEs driven by a common stable process. This stable process arises due to the stable central limit theorem, and the particles in the limit system are independent and identically distributed, conditionally on that. That is, the $N$-particle system exhibits the conditional propagation of chaos property.</description>

      <title>Finite-time trajectorial estimates for inhomogeneous random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider integer-valued random walks with independent but not identically distributed increments, and extend to this context several classical estimates, including a local limit theorem, precise small-ball estimates (both conditional on the final point and unconditional), and bounds on the probability that the random walk trajectory remains positive up to a given time (again, both conditional on the final point and unconditional). Two key features of this work are that the bounds are non-asymptotic, holding true for finite time horizons, and, crucially, that the latter hold uniformly over an entire class of admissible increment sequences. This provides a robust framework for applications. These results are, in particular, tailored for the analysis of processes derived through a time-dependent tilting of the increments of a time-homogeneous random walk.</description>

      <title>Random Walk conditioned to stay above a non-flat floor: curvature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $h:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be $C^2$ and such that $\sup_{[0,1]} h''&lt;0$. For a (large) positive integer $n$, set $h_n(k) = n h(k/n)$ for any $k\in\{0,\dots,n\}$. We consider a random walk $(S_k)_{k\geq 0}$ with i.i.d.\ centred increments having some finite exponential moments. We are interested in the event $\{S\geq h_n\} = \{S_k\geq h_n(k)\;\forall k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\}$. It is well known that $P(S\geq h_n \,|\, S_0=0,\, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil) = e^{n\int_0^1 I(h'(s)) \,ds + o(n)}$, where $I$ is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function associated to the increments. We first prove that the leading correction is of order $e^{-\Theta(n^{1/3})}$. We then turn our attention to the conditional random walk measure $P^h_n = P(\cdot \,|\, S\geq h_n, S_0=0, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil)$. We prove that the one-point tails are of the form $\mathbb{P}_n^h (S_k \geq h_n(k) + t n^{1/3} ) = e^{-\Theta(t^{3/2})}$ for all $t&lt;n^\beta$ for any $\beta\in (0,1/6)$. Moreover, we prove that, for any $r\geq 1$, $E_n^h((S_k-h_n(k))^r) = \Theta(n^{r/3})$ and $\mathrm{Var}_{P_n^h}(S_k) = \Theta(n^{2/3})$, for all $k$ far enough from $0$ and $n$. In addition, we show that $\mathrm{Cov}_{P_n^h}(S_k,S_\ell) \leq e^{-O(|\ell-k|/n^{2/3})}$ for all $k,\ell$ not too close to $0$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup Functional for SDE with Time-Varying Fractional Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic differential equations driven by time-varying fractional noise of the form X(t) = x0 + integral from 0 to t b_s(X(s)) ds + integral from 0 to t sigma_s dB^H(s), where B^H denotes fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H. Our main results are established for H in (1/4, 1) by extending small ball probability estimates and the Girsanov theorem for fractional Brownian motion to the setting with time-dependent coefficients. Regarding the choice of norms, for 1/4 &lt; H &lt; 1/2 the analysis is valid under the supremum norm and Holder norms of order 0 &lt; beta &lt; H - 1/4. For 1/2 &lt; H &lt; 1 the analysis applies to Holder norms of order beta satisfying H - 1/2 &lt; beta &lt; H - 1/4. In the case H = 1/2, the admissible norms depend on the spatial regularity of the drift coefficient b: specifically, if b is n-times continuously differentiable, then Holder norms of order 0 &lt; beta &lt; 1/2 - 1/(2n) are permissible. To validate our theoretical findings, we perform numerical simulations for a classical double-well potential system, illustrating how time-varying fractional noise influences transition dynamics between metastable states.</description>

      <title>From Cannings model to Brownian motion conditioned on local time profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling limits of genealogical trees arising from Cannings models. Under suitable moment conditions, we show that the rescaled contour and height functions converge to a time change of Brownian motion conditioned on a given local time profile. This conditioned Brownian motion is a self-interacting diffusion constructed independently by Warren--Yor (1998) and Aldous (1998). A key ingredient in our proof is a sequential version of the coming-down-from-infinity property.</description>

      <title>On a density problem related to a theorem of Szeg\H{o}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Szeg\H{o} states that for any probability measure $\mu=w\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}+\mu_s$ on the unit circle the polynomials are dense in $L^2(\mathbb{T},\mu)$ if and only if $\log(w)\notin L^1(\mathbb{T})$. A related question asks whether the monomials with exponents in some subset $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{N}_0$ already span $L^2(\mathbb{T},\mu)$ if $\log(w)\notin L^1(\mathbb{T})$. A result by Olevskii and Ulanovskii gives an answer if $\mu$ belongs to a class of absolutely continuous measures. We investigate the same question for Markoff measures.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for the Landau equation via microcanonical binary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully constructive, conservative, and collision-level realization of Kac's program for the spatially homogeneous Landau equation across the full interaction range, including the Coulomb case. Our model is the microcanonical binary-collision (MBC) process: a reversible pure-jump $N$-particle Markov process that is Landau-native, realizing the grazing-collision mechanism via small conservative rotations of relative velocities. The analysis hinges on two critical structural pillars: a Fisher-information dissipation mechanism that extends the Guill\'en--Silvestre paradigm (Acta Math. 234:315-375, 2025) to a genuinely conservative particle system, yielding robust control of singular configurations, and a quantitative self-averaging principle that enforces a coherent deterministic emergence of the Landau flow from the microscopic dynamics. We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\to\infty, h\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first fully conservative, Landau-native binary-collision model rigorously shown to produce the Landau equation over the entire interaction range.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we explicitly compute the probability that a given cell in a random standard Young tableau of the shifted staircase shape $(2n-1, 2n-3, \ldots, 3,1)$ contains the maximal label. We also show that the asymptotic distribution of the cell containing the maximal label is governed by the quarter-circle law. The bijection between the tableaux and thereduced decompositions of the longest element of the group $B_n$ of the signed permutations yields the probability distribution of the first (and any) letter of the random reduced decompositions. We also show the results of some computational experiments on the random sorting networks of $B_n$.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition for Opinion Dynamics with Competing Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear dynamics of binary opinions in a population of agents connected by a directed network, influenced by two competing forces. On the one hand, agents are stubborn, i.e., have a tendency for one of the two opinions; on the other hand, there is a disruptive bias, $p\in[0,1]$, that drives the agents toward the other opinion. The disruptive bias models external factors, such as market innovations or social controllers, aiming to challenge the status quo, while agents' stubbornness reinforces the initial opinion making it harder for the external bias to drive the process toward change. Each agent updates its opinion according to a nonlinear function of the states of its neighbors and of the bias $p$. We consider the case of random directed graphs with prescribed in- and out-degree sequences and we prove that the dynamics exhibits a phase transition: when the disruptive bias $p$ is larger than a critical threshold $p_c$, the population converges in constant time to a consensus on the disruptive opinion. Conversely, when the bias $p$ is less than $p_c$, the system enters a metastable state in which only a fraction of agents $q_\star(p)&lt;1$ will share the new opinion for a long time. We characterize $p_c$ and $q_\star(p)$ explicitly, showing that they only depend on few simple statistics of the degree sequences. Our analysis relies on a dual system of branching, coalescing, and dying particles, which we show exhibits equivalent behavior and allows a rigorous characterization of the system's dynamics. Our results characterize the interplay between the degree of the agents, their stubbornness, and the external bias, shedding light on the tipping points of opinion dynamics in networks.</description>

      <title>The fastest way through a traffic light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous solution of an optimisation problem of minimizing the expected delay caused by encountering a red traffic light on a road journey. The problem incorporates simple constraints on maximum speed, acceleration and braking rates, and depends on the assumed distribution of the remaining time until the traffic light will turn green, after it is first noticed. We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution. The key technique is to write the problem in terms of a two-dimensional pressure integral, so that the problem becomes analogous to filling a tank with a given quantity of liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For general penalized Markov processes with soft killing, we propose a simple criterion ensuring uniform convergence of conditional distributions in Wasserstein distance to a unique quasi-stationary distribution. We give several examples of application where our criterion can be checked, including Bernoulli convolutions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes of the form of switched dynamical systems, for which convergence in total variation is not possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations. Namely, we explain how to construct uniform permutations in given conjugacy classes from certain point processes in the plane. This enables the use of geometric tools to study various statistics of such permutations. For their longest decreasing subsequences, we prove universality of the $2\sqrt n$ asymptotic. For Robinson--Schensted shapes, we prove universality of the Vershik--Kerov--Logan--Shepp limit curve, thus solving a conjecture of Kammoun. For the number of records, we establish a phase transition phenomenon as the number of fixed points grows. For pattern counts, we obtain an asymptotic normality result, partially answering a conjecture of Hamaker and Rhoades.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration Inequalities and Free Probability II. Two-sided Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new family of nonasymptotic matrix concentration inequalities that sharply capture the spectral properties of very general random matrices in terms of an associated noncommutative model. These methods achieved matching upper and lower bounds for smooth spectral statistics, but only provided upper bounds for the spectral edges. Here we obtain matching lower bounds for the spectral edges, completing the theory initiated in the first paper.
  The resulting two-sided bounds enable the study of problems that require an exact determination of the spectral edges to leading order, which is fundamentally beyond the reach of classical matrix concentration inequalities. To illustrate their utility, we develop two general results that explain phase transitions of spectral outliers of a large class of nonhomogeneous random matrices. This enables us to elucidate phase transition phenomena that arise in diverse applications, including decoding node labels on graphs, tensor PCA, contextual stochastic block models, and centered sample covariance matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Gibbs variational principle for the Asakura--Oosawa model in which particles of random size obey a hardcore constraint of non-overlap and are additionally subject to a temperature-dependent area interaction. The particle size is unbounded, leading to infinite-range interactions, and the potential cannot be written as a $k$-body interaction for fixed $k$. As a byproduct, we also prove the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs point processes satisfying the DLR equations. The essential control over the influence of boundary conditions can be established using the geometry of the model and the hard-core constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the trace of a discrete-time simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$, we consider the evolution of favorite sites, i.e., sites that achieve the maximal local time at a certain time. For $d=2$, we show that almost surely three favorite sites occur simultaneously infinitely often and eventually there is no simultaneous occurrence of four favorite sites. For $d\geq 3$, we derive sharp asymptotics of the number of favorite sites. This answers an open question of Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}v\'{e}sz (1987), which was brought up again in Dembo (2005).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential ergodicity of partially dissipative McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the \(L^1\)-Wasserstein distance has been extensively studied using asymptotic reflection coupling. However, the reflection coupling method is not applicable for the exponential ergodicity in $L^2$-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy. In this paper, we first establish uniform log-Sobolev inequalities (in the frozen measure variable with bounded second moments) for the invariant probability measure of the corresponding SDEs with frozen distribution. Second, for the McKean-Vlasov SDEs, we combine the log-Harnack inequality and Talagrand's inequality to derive exponential ergodicity in both $L^2$-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy. Furthermore, we extend these main results to the case of degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-Time Convergence Rates to a Nonlinear Markov Chain for Mean-Field Interacting Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ particles interacting through their empirical distribution on a finite state space in continuous time. In the formal limit as $N\to\infty$, the system takes the form of a nonlinear (McKean--Vlasov) Markov chain. This paper rigorously establishes this limit. Specifically, under the assumption that the mean field system has a unique, exponentially stable stationary distribution, we show that the weak error between the empirical measures of the $N$-particle system and the law of the mean field system is of order $1/N$ uniformly in time. Our analysis makes use of a master equation for test functions evaluated along the measure flow of the mean field system, and we demonstrate that the solutions of this master equation are sufficiently regular. We then show that exponential stability of the mean field system is implied by exponential stability for solutions of the linearized Kolmogorov equation with a source term. Finally, we show that our results can be applied to the study of mean field games and give a new condition for the existence of a unique stationary distribution for a nonlinear Markov chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the gradient flow structure, well-posedness, and asymptotic behavior of the Fokker-Planck equation defined on locally uniformly finite graphs, which is highly non-trivial compared with the finite case. We first construct a 2-Wasserstein-type metric and gradient flow equation in the probability density space associated with the underlying graphs. Then, we prove the global existence of solution to the Fokker-Planck equation using a novel approach that differs significantly from the methods applied in the finite case. We also demonstrate that the solution converges to the Gibbs distribution in the $\ell^{r}(V,\bm{\pi})$ norm with $r\in [2,\infty]$, by using the indicator set partitioning method. To the best of our knowledge, this work seems the first result on the study of Wasserstein-type metrics and the Fokker-Planck equation in probability density spaces defined on infinite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic 3D Euler equations on a periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^3$, driven by a $GG^*$-Wiener process $B$ of trace class:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d} u+\mathrm{div}(u\otimes u)\,\mathrm{d} t+\nabla p\,\mathrm{d}t=\mathrm{d}B, \quad \mathrm{div} u=0.
  \end{align*} First, for any $\vartheta&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions $u\in C([0,\infty),C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time $\mathfrak{t}$, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability, i.e. it holds almost surely
  \begin{align*}
  \|u(t\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2&lt; \|u(s\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2 +2 \int_{s\wedge\mathfrak{t}}^{t\wedge\mathfrak{t}} \big\langle u(r), \mathrm{d} B(r) \big\rangle +\mathrm{Tr}\big(GG^*\big) (t\wedge\mathfrak{t}-s\wedge\mathfrak{t}),
  \end{align*}
  for any $0\leq s &lt; t&lt;\infty$. We also provide a brief proof of energy conservation for $\vartheta&gt;1/3$ based on \cite{CET94}, thereby confirming the Onsager theorem for the stochastic 3D Euler equations. Second, let $0&lt;\bar{\vartheta}&lt;\bar{\beta}&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C([0,\infty),C^{\bar{\vartheta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$ for arbitrary divergence-free initial data in $C^{\bar{\beta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3)$. Our construction relies on the convex integration method developed in the deterministic setting by \cite{Ise18}, adapting it to the stochastic context by introducing a novel energy inequality into the convex integration scheme and combining stochastic analysis arguments with a Wong--Zakai type estimate.</description>

      <title>Matrix Moment and Concentration Inequalities for Martingales and Ergodic Markov Chains with Applications in Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study moment and concentration inequalities for the spectral norm of sums of dependent random matrices.
  We establish novel Rosenthal-Burkholder inequalities for discrete-time matrix local martingales, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality for continuous matrix local martingales, as well as matrix Rosenthal, Hoeffding, and Bernstein inequalities for ergodic Markov chains.
  Compared with previous work on matrix concentration inequalities for Markov chains, which assume a non-zero absolute $L^2$-spectral gap or the stronger $\psi$-mixing condition, our results assume geometric ergodicity, a condition commonly used in statistical applications.
  Furthermore, our results have leading terms that match the Markov chain central limit theorem, rather than relying on suboptimal variance proxies.
  We also give dimension-free versions of the inequalities, which are independent of the ambient dimension $d$ and relies on the effective rank instead.
  This enables the generalization of our results to linear operators in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
  Our results have extensive applications in statistics and machine learning; in particular, we obtain improved bounds in covariance estimation and principal component analysis on Markovian data.</description>

      <title>Limiting distribution of the chemical distance in high dimensional critical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the asymptotic distribution of the chemical distance in high-dimensional critical Bernoulli percolation. Namely, we show that the distance between the origin and a distant vertex conditioned to lie in the cluster of the origin converges in distribution when rescaled by a multiple the square of the Euclidean distance. The limiting distribution has an explicit density and coincides with the distribution of the time for a Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ conditioned to hit a given unit vector to reach its target. Our result follows from a general moment computation for quantities that have an additive structure across the pivotal edges on a long-range connection in percolation. In addition to the number of pivotal edges in a long connection, this also includes the effective resistance. The existence of the incipient infinite cluster limit, in a form recently established, plays a key role in the derivation of our results.</description>

Abstract: We begin our journey by recalling the fundamentals of Probability Theory that underlie one of its most significant applications to real-world problems: Parametric Estimation. Throughout the text, we systematically develop this theme by presenting and discussing the main tools it encompasses (concentration inequalities, limit theorems, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood, least squares, and hypothesis testing) always with an eye toward both their theoretical underpinnings and practical relevance. While our approach follows the broad contours of conventional expositions, we depart from tradition by consistently exploring the geometric aspects of probability, particularly the invariance properties of normally distributed random vectors. This geometric perspective is taken further in an extended appendix, where we introduce the rudiments of Brownian motion and the corresponding stochastic calculus, culminating in It\^o's celebrated change-of-variables formula. To highlight its scope and elegance, we present some of its most striking applications: the sharp Gaussian concentration inequality (a central example of the "concentration of measure phenomenon"), the Feynman-Kac formula (used to derive a path integral representation for the Laplacian heat kernel), and, as a concluding delicacy, the Black-Scholes strategy in Finance.</description>

      <title>Coupling Invasion and First Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a continuous phase transition in Bernoulli bond percolation on the integer lattice is equivalent to a vanishing probability a vertex is invaded in invasion percolation. We provide a coupling between invasion percolation and first passage percolation with log-uniform passage times. This yields a new equivalent condition for a continuous phase transition in bond percolation.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for 2-d generalised Parabolic Anderson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a priori bounds for solutions to $(\partial_t - \Delta) u = \sigma (u) \xi$ in finite volume in the framework of Hairer's Regularity Structures [Invent Math 198:269--504, 2014]. We assume $\sigma \in C_b^2 (\mathbb{R})$ and that $\xi$ is of negative H\"older regularity of order $- 1 - \kappa$ where $\kappa &lt; \bar{\kappa}$ for an explicit $\bar{\kappa}&lt; 1/3$, and that it can be lifted to a model in the sense of Regularity Structures. Our main results guarantee non-explosion of the solution in finite time and a growth which is at most polynomial in $t &gt; 0$. Our estimates imply global well-posedness for the 2-d generalised parabolic Anderson model on the torus, as well as for the parabolic quantisation of the Sine-Gordon Euclidean Quantum Field Theory (EQFT) on the torus in the regime $\beta^2 \in (4 \pi, (1 + \bar{\kappa}) 4 \pi)$. We also consider the parabolic quantisation of a massive Sine-Gordon EQFT and derive estimates that imply the existence of the measure for the same range of $\beta$. Finally, our estimates apply to It\^o SPDEs in the sense of Da Prato-Zabczyk [Stochastic Equations in Infinite Dimensions, Enc. Math. App., Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992] and imply existence of a stochastic flow beyond the trace-class regime.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of Euler-Maruyama scheme for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with density-dependent drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDE) whose drift depends pointwisely on marginal density and satisfies a local integrability condition in time-space variables. The drift and noise coefficients are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous in distribution variable with respect to Wasserstein metric $W_p$. Our approach is by approximation with mollifiers. We prove strong existence of a solution. Weak and strong uniqueness are obtained when $p=1$, the drift coefficient is bounded, and the diffusion coefficient is distribution free.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing on Random Regular Graphs beyond Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hardcore model is a fundamental probabilistic model extensively studied in statistical physics, probability theory, and computer science. For graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, a well-known computational phase transition occurs at the tree-uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) = \frac{(\Delta-1)^{\Delta-1}}{(\Delta-2)^\Delta}$, where the mixing behavior of the Glauber dynamics (a simple Markov chain) undergoes a sharp transition.
  It is conjectured that random regular graphs exhibit different mixing behavior, with the slowdown occurring far beyond the uniqueness threshold. We confirm this conjecture by showing that, for the hardcore model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs, the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly with high probability when $\lambda = O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$, which is significantly beyond the uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) \approx e/\Delta$. Our result establishes a sharp distinction between the hardcore model on worst-case and beyond-worst-case instances, showing that the worst-case and average-case complexities of sampling and counting are fundamentally different.
  This result of rapid mixing on random instances follows from a new criterion we establish for rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for any distribution supported on a downward closed set family. Our criterion is simple, general, and easy to check. In addition to proving new mixing conditions for the hardcore model, we also establish improved mixing time bounds for sampling uniform matchings or $b$ matchings on graphs, the random cluster model on matroids with $q \in [0,1)$, and the determinantal point process. Our proof of this new criterion for rapid mixing combines and generalizes several recent tools in a novel way, including a trickle down theorem for field dynamics, spectral/entropic stability, and a new comparison result between field dynamics and Glauber dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian correlation inequality for centered convex sets and the case of equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Milman's recent observation, we prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds for convex sets having the same barycenter, and especially for centered ones. This gives an affirmative answer to the problem proposed by Szarek and Werner. We also characterize the equality case. The study of the equality case in the non-symmetric Gaussian correlation inequality relates to the following question: Let $X$ be a standard Gaussian random vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For which convex sets $K_1,K_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, are the two events $\{X\in K_1\}$ and $\{X\in K_2\}$ independent? By imposing an additional normalization that $K_1$ and $K_2$ have the same barycenter, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for this independence. The conditions also identify when $\|X\|_{K_1}$ and $\|X\|_{K_2}$ are independent as random variables.</description>

      <title>Possibilistic inferential models: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An inferential model (IM) is a model describing the construction of provably reliable, data-driven uncertainty quantification and inference about relevant unknowns. IMs and Fisher's fiducial argument have similar objectives, but a fundamental distinction between the two is that the former doesn't require that uncertainty quantification be probabilistic, offering greater flexibility and allowing for a proof of its reliability. Important recent developments have been made thanks in part to newfound connections with the imprecise probability literature, in particular, possibility theory. The brand of possibilistic IMs studied here are straightforward to construct, have very strong frequentist-like reliability properties, and offer fully conditional, Bayesian-like (imprecise) probabilistic reasoning. This paper reviews these key recent developments, describing the new theory, methods, and computational tools. A generalization of the basic possibilistic IM is also presented, making new and unexpected connections with ideas in modern statistics and machine learning, e.g., bootstrap and conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Minimal Denominators Lying in Subsets of the Ring of Polynomials over a Finite Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbol{\alpha},q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</description>

      <title>Stochastic representation of solutions for the parabolic Cauchy problem with variable exponent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponent coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>
