      <title>Recent advances in solar data-driven MHD simulations of the formation and evolution of CME flux ropes</title>

Abstract: Filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections are physical phenomena related to magnetic flux ropes carrying electric current. A magnetic flux rope is a key structure for solar eruptions, and when it carries a southward magnetic field component when propagating to the Earth. It is the primary driver of strong geomagnetic storms. As a result, developing a numerical model capable of capturing the entire progression of a flux rope, from its inception to its eruptive phase, is crucial for forecasting adverse space weather. The existence of such flux ropes is revealed by the presence of sigmoids in active regions or hot channels by observations from space and ground instruments. After proposing cartoons in 2D, potential, linear, non-linear-force-free-field (NLFFF) and non-force-free-field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, 3D numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation models were developed, first in a static configuration and later dynamic data-driven MHD models using high resolution observed vector magnetograms. This paper reviews a few recent developments in data-driven mode, such as the time-dependent magneto-frictional (TMF) and thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Hereafter, to demonstrate the capacity of these models to reveal the physics of observations, we present the results for three events explored in our group: 1. the eruptive X1.0 flare on 28 October 2021; 2. the filament eruption on 18 August 2022; and 3. the confined X2.2 flare on 6 September 2017. These case studies validate the ability of data-driven models to retrieve observations, including the formation and eruption of flux ropes, 3D magnetic reconnection, CME three-part structures and the failed eruption. Based on these results, we provide some arguments for the formation mechanisms of flux ropes, the physical nature of the CME leading front, and the constraints of failed eruptions.</description>

      <title>Density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar corona</title>

Abstract: It has been suggested that under solar coronal conditions, drift waves may contribute to coronal heating. Specific properties of the drift waves to be expected in the solar corona have, however, not yet been determined using more advanced numerical models. We investigate the linear properties of density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar coronal plasma using gyrokinetic ion-electron simulations with the gyrokinetic code GENE, solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in five dimensions assuming a simple slab geometry. We determine the frequencies and growth rates of the coronal density gradient-driven drift waves with changing plasma parameters, such as the electron \b{eta} , the density gradient, the magnetic shear and additional temperature gradients. To investigate the influence of the finite Larmor radius effect on the growth and structure of the modes, we also compare the gyrokinetic simulation results to those obtained from drift-kinetics. In most of the investigated conditions, the drift wave has positive growth rates that increase with increasing density gradient and decreasing \b{eta} . In the case of increasing magnetic shear, we find that from a certain point, the growth rate reaches a plateau. Depending on the considered reference environment, the frequencies and growth rates of these waves lie on the order of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. These values correspond to the observed solar wind density fluctuations near the Sun detected by WISPR, currently of unexplained origin. As a next step, nonlinear simulations are required to determine the expected fluctuation amplitudes and the plasma heating resulting from this mechanism.</description>
