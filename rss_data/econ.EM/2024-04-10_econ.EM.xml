      <title>Regression Discontinuity Design with Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers who estimate treatment effects using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) typically assume that there are no spillovers between the treated and control units. This may be unrealistic. We characterize the estimand of RDD in a setting where spillovers occur between units that are close in their values of the running variable. Under the assumption that spillovers are linear-in-means, we show that the estimand depends on the ratio of two terms: (1) the radius over which spillovers occur and (2) the choice of bandwidth used for the local linear regression. Specifically, RDD estimates direct treatment effect when radius is of larger order than the bandwidth, and total treatment effect when radius is of smaller order than the bandwidth. In the more realistic regime where radius is of similar order as the bandwidth, the RDD estimand is a mix of the above effects. To recover direct and spillover effects, we propose incorporating estimated spillover terms into local linear regression -- the local analog of peer effects regression. We also clarify the settings under which the donut-hole RD is able to eliminate the effects of spillovers.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Ordered Panel Logit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a dynamic ordered logit model for panel data with fixed effects. The main contribution of the paper is to construct a set of valid moment conditions that are free of the fixed effects. The moment functions can be computed using four or more periods of data, and the paper presents sufficient conditions for the moment conditions to identify the common parameters of the model, namely the regression coefficients, the autoregressive parameters, and the threshold parameters. The availability of moment conditions suggests that these common parameters can be estimated using the generalized method of moments, and the paper documents the performance of this estimator using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical illustration to self-reported health status using the British Household Panel Survey.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes When Estimation Precision Predicts Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical Bayes methods usually maintain a prior independence assumption: The unknown parameters of interest are independent from the known standard errors of the estimates. This assumption is often theoretically questionable and empirically rejected. This paper instead models the conditional distribution of the parameter given the standard errors as a flexibly parametrized family of distributions, leading to a family of methods that we call CLOSE. This paper establishes that (i) CLOSE is rate-optimal for squared error Bayes regret, (ii) squared error regret control is sufficient for an important class of economic decision problems, and (iii) CLOSE is worst-case robust when our assumption on the conditional distribution is misspecified. Empirically, using CLOSE leads to sizable gains for selecting high-mobility Census tracts. Census tracts selected by CLOSE are substantially more mobile on average than those selected by the standard shrinkage method.</description>
