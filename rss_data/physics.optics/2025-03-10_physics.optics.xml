      <title>High Harmonic Generation from a Noble Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has typically been explored in transparent dielectrics and semiconductors. Metals have long been dismissed due to their strong reflectivity at infrared wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate HHG from silver - a noble metal - using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses at near-normal incidence. Our results show that sub-cycle electron dynamics within the material's penetration depth can drive high-order harmonics, challenging the prevailing notion that metals are unsuited for infrared-driven strong-field processes. Despite silver's high reflectivity and large free-electron density, we observe nonperturbative harmonics extending into the extreme ultraviolet (up to 20 eV). Moreover, silver's multi-shot damage threshold proves surprisingly high (30 TW/cm^2) - comparable to large-bandgap dielectrics like magnesium oxide - thereby enabling intense strong-field processes in a metallic environment. Measuring the orientation dependence of the emitted harmonics reveals that the process arises from coherent electron dynamics in the crystal lattice, rather than from a plasma-driven mechanism. Time-dependent density-matrix simulations based on maximally localized Wannier functions show that low-order harmonics predominantly originate from conduction electrons near the Fermi surface (s- and p-type orbitals), whereas higher harmonics rely on bound d-electron excitations. These findings establish metals - long thought unfavorable for HHG - as a promising platform for ultrafast strong-field physics, extending high-harmonic spectroscopy to regimes in which lattice order and plasma formation directly intersect. This work expands the frontier of solid-state HHG to all-metallic attosecond pulse generation and underscores the potential of metals as robust XUV sources for advanced attosecond metrology.</description>

      <title>Designing Refractive Index Fluids of Food Dye for Light Propagation through Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media. The optical properties of the solutions were carefully examined using spectrometry and ellipsometry under two extreme conditions, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of dye solutions. Additionally, we demonstrated using dye molecules to control light propagation through scattering media. Our findings highlight the potential of food dyes as cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives for future advancements in biomedical imaging, optical communication, and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>An alternative application of GaAs-based light-emitting diodes: X-ray detection and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaAs-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly employed in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, biosensing, optical communications, and night vision. In this paper, we present an alternative application of GaAs-based LED with SI-GaAs substrate for X-ray detection and imaging. The mechanism relies on the semiconductor frequency down-conversion process, where the SI-GaAs substrate acts as a photodetector (PD). Upon X-ray irradiation, the generated photocurrent by the SI-GaAs substrate drives the LED to emit NIR photons which can be detect by a low-cost CCD. We demonstrate direct X-ray detection and present preliminary imaging results, providing another example of the applicability of the PD-LED design for optical frequency conversion. The proposed LED X-ray detector leverages mature materials and fabrication processes. The application of the frequency down-conversion concept makes it possible for pixel-less imaging using a large single imaging unit, eliminating the need for readout circuits. This PD-LED architecture offers an alternative approach to direct X-ray detection and imaging, characterized by higher absorption, improved image resolution, and enhanced material stability.</description>

      <title>Lanthanide upconversion nonlinearity: a key probe feature for background-free deep-tissue imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications, largely due to their anti-Stokes shifted emission enabling autofluorescence-free signal detection. However, residual excitation light can still interfere with their relatively low brightness. While commonly used lock-in detection can distinguish weak signals from substantial random background, concurrently modulated residual excitation light is not eliminated. This remains a challenge, particularly under demanding experimental conditions.
  Here, we explore the inherent nonlinear response of UCNPs and discover that UCNPs can act as frequency mixers in response to intensity-modulated excitation. Particularly, modulated excitation with more than one base modulation frequency can generate additional low-frequency beating-signals. We show how these signals are resolvable by low-speed detectors such as cameras, are devoid of ambient and residual excitation light, and how they can be enhanced through nanoparticle engineering. Detection of beating-signals thus provides a strategy to significantly enhance signal-to-background conditions in UCNP-based bioimaging and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency from Optical with Instabilities below $10^{-15}$- Generation and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a frequency synthesis that achieves exceptional stability by transferring optical signals to the radio frequency (RF) domain at 100 MHz. We describe and characterize two synthesis chains composed of a cryogenic silicon cavity-stabilized laser at 1542 nm and an ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass cavity at 1157 nm, both converted to 10 GHz signals via Ti:Sapphire and Er/Yb:glass optical frequency combs (OFCs). The 10 GHz microwave outputs are further divided down to 100 MHz using a commercial microwave prescaler, which exhibits a residual frequency instability of $\sigma_y(1~\text{s})&lt;10^{-15}$ and low $10^{-18}$ level at a few thousand seconds. Measurements are performed using a newly developed custom ultra-low-noise digital measurement system and are compared to the carrier-suppression technique. The new system enables high-sensitivity evaluation across the entire synthesis chain, from the optical and microwave heterodynes as well as the direct RF signals. Results show an absolute instability of $\sigma_y(1~\text{s})~\approx~4.7\times10^{-16}$ at 100 MHz. This represents the first demonstration of such low instability at 100 MHz, corresponding to a phase noise of -140 dBc/Hz at a 1 Hz offset and significantly surpassing earlier systems. These advancements open new opportunities for precision metrology and timing systems.</description>

      <title>All-optical stochastic switching of magnetization textures in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-optical control of magnetization at room temperature broadens the scope of applications of spin degrees-of-freedom in data storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. Topological magnetic spin structures, such as skyrmions, are of particular interest due to their particle-like properties, small size and inherent stability. Controlling skyrmion states without strong magnetic fields or large current densities would create new possibilities for their application. In this work, we utilize femtosecond optical pulses to alter the helicity of the spin configuration in dipolar skyrmions formed in the kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ in the absence of an external magnetic field and at room temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the stochastic, light-induced switching process of chiral N\'eel caps, while the internal Bloch component of the dipolar skyrmions remain unchanged. In addition to this switching process, we observe the interconversion between type I skyrmionic and type II bubble configurations depending on the external magnetic field and illumination conditions. To corroborate the spin states and the light-induced magnetization dynamics, micromagnetic modelling and simulations of the resulting electron phase shift maps are conducted to elucidate the spin rearrangement induced by individual femtosecond optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Epsilon Near Zero phenomena for on-chip photonic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) systems exhibit unconventional electromagnetic response close to their zero permittivity regime. Here, we explore the ability of ultrathin ENZ films to modulate the transmission of radiation from an underlying quantum emitter through active control of the carrier density of the ENZ film. The achievable on/off switching ratio is shown to be constrained by the material's loss parameter, particularly in the ENZ regime, where transmissivity increases with higher material loss. The finite loss in real materials limit the more extraordinary potential of ideal near-zero-index systems. Along with an in-depth discussion on the material parameters vis-a-vis the underlying physics, this work provides avenues to overcome the shortcomings of finite loss in real materials. These findings are intended to guide material development and offer valuable insights for designing on-chip optical modulators and beam steering devices operating in the near-infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Topology on Nonorientable Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify gapped and gapless phases of non-Hermitian band structures on two-dimensional nonorientable parameter spaces. Such spaces arise in a wide range of physical systems in the presence of non-symmorphic parameter space symmetries. For gapped phases, we find that nonorientable spaces provide a natural setting for exploring fundamental structural problems in braid group theory, such as torsion and conjugacy. Gapless phases, which host exceptional points (EPs), explicitly violate the fermion doubling theorem, even in two-band models. We demonstrate that EPs traversing the nonorientable parameter space exhibit non-Abelian charge inversion. These braided phases and their transitions leave distinct signatures in the form of bulk Fermi arc degeneracies, offering a concrete route toward experimental realization and verification.</description>

      <title>Retrieving information in sloppy quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of complex systems requires a progressively larger number of parameters. However, in practice it often happens that a small subset of parameters suffice to describe the dynamics of the system itself in terms of stiff combinations, while the remaining sloppy combinations provide no information on the system. While this effect can reduce model complexity, it can also limit the estimation precision when the stiff and sloppy combinations are unknown to the experimenter, and one is forced to estimate the potentially sloppy model parameters. We explored how such a sloppy behavior can be controlled and counteracted via quantum weak measurements in the estimation of two sequential phases. We showed that the introduction of a weak measurement of variable strength in-between the two phases allows to switch from a fully sloppy setup to a fully determined one where both phases can be estimated with quantum-limited precision. Our work provides an important insight of sloppiness detection in quantum systems, with promising applications in quantum metrology and imaging, as well as to quantum security and quantum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Programmable non-Hermitian photonic quantum walks via dichroic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary operator generated by a Hermitian Hamiltonian. However, when certain degrees of freedom are coupled to an environment, the relevant dynamics can be captured by non-unitary evolution operators, arising from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a photonic platform that implements non-unitary quantum walks, commonly used to emulate open-system dynamics, in the synthetic space of light transverse momentum. These walks are realized by propagating light through a series of dichroic liquid-crystal metasurfaces, that impart polarization-dependent momentum shifts. The non-unitary behavior stems from dichroic dye molecules with polarization-dependent absorption, whose orientation is coupled to that of the liquid crystals. We demonstrate multiple walks up to five time steps, with adjustable levels of dichroism set by the metasurface voltage, which is controlled remotely. This discrete-time process maps onto two-band tight-binding models with reciprocal yet non-Hermitian nearest-neighbor couplings, corresponding to a less-studied class of non-Hermitian systems. Our platform broadens the range of optical simulators for controlled investigations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Raman Forbidden Layer-Breathing Modes in Layered Semiconductor Materials Activated by Phonon and Optical Cavity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Raman forbidden layer-breathing modes (LBMs) in layered semiconductor materials (LSMs). The intensity distribution of all observed LBMs depends on layer number, incident light wavelength and refractive index mismatch between LSM and underlying substrate. These results are understood by a Raman scattering theory via the proposed spatial interference model, where the naturally occurring optical and phonon cavities in LSMs enable spatially coherent photon-phonon coupling mediated by the corresponding one-dimensional periodic electronic states. Our work reveals the spatial coherence of photon and phonon fields on the phonon excitation via photon/phonon cavity engineering.</description>

      <title>Electric-field sensing with driven-dissipative time crystals in room-temperature Rydberg vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode competition in nonequilibrium Rydberg gases enables the exploration of emergent many-body phases. This work leverages this emergent phase for electric field detection at room temperature. Sensitive frequency-resolved electric field measurements at very low-frequencies (VLF) are of central importance in a wide range of applications where deep-penetration is required in communications, navigation and imaging or surveying. The long wavelengths on order of 10-100 km (3-30 kHz) limit the efficiency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of compact classical detectors that are constrained by the Chu limit. Rydberg-atom electrometers are an attractive approach for microwave electric-field sensors but have reduced sensitivity at lower-frequencies. Very recent efforts to advance the standard Rydberg-atoms approach is based on DC electric-field (E-field) Stark shifting and have resulted in sensitivities between 67.9-2.2 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 (0.1-10 kHz) by fine optimization of the DC E-field. A major challenge in these approaches is the need for embedded electrodes or plates due to DC E-field Stark screening effect, which can perturb coupling of VLF signals when injected from external sources. In this article, it is demonstrated that state-of-art sensitivity (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) can instead be achieved using limit-cycle oscillations in driven-dissipative Rydberg atoms by using a magnetic field (B-field) to develop mode-competition between nearby Rydberg states. The mode-competition between nearby Rydberg-states develop an effective transition centered at the oscillation frequency capable of supporting external VLF E-field coupling in the ~10-15kHz regime without the requirement for fine optimization of the B-field magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Classical vector waves can possess dedicated spin angular momenta (SAM), which are \emph{perpendicular} to the propagation direction, as surprisingly revealed by the recent recognition of transverse SAM in electromagnetic (EM) fields. In this paper, we adopt the Hertz potential method to define structured vector fields and derive analytically the SAM of the wave fields in closed form. Our calculations not only confirm that transverse SAM may originate from the first-order spatial inhomogeneity of the momentum of EM waves, but also point out that for \emph{non-planar vector waves with near fields}, an extraordinary spin appears as a distinct part out of transverse spin. We further demonstrate that the proposed transverse spins prevail universally in both propagating and evanescent waves. This work renews our fundamental understanding of the decomposition of SAM for classical vector waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental demonstration of cross-polarization backward stimulated Brillouin scattering (BSBS) in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. Performing polarization-sensitive pump and probe measurements, we captured both intra- and intermodal scattering between counterpropagating fundamental optical modes. Remarkably, cross-polarization scattering achieved SBS gains that exceeded $G_{B}=$80m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$. This substantial gain not only broadens the utility of polarization in SBS but also paves the way for high-performance devices, including ultranarrowband lasers, robust broadband nonreciprocal devices, RF filters, and microwave-to-optical converters.</description>

      <title>Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend our analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We identify two distinct propagation regimes: one where the field oscillates with constant amplitude, and another where it grows exponentially at long times. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Shaping in the Picosecond Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightwave pulse shaping in the picosecond regime has remained unaddressed because it resides beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques, either due to its inherently narrow spectral content or fundamental speed limitations in electronic devices. The so-called picosecond shaping gap hampers progress in all areas correlated with time-modulated light-matter interactions, such as photoelectronics, health and medical technologies, and energy and material sciences. We report on a novel nonlinear method to simultaneously frequency-convert and adaptably shape the envelope of light wavepackets in the picosecond regime by balancing spectral engineering and nonlinear conversion in solid-state nonlinear media, without requiring active devices. We capture computationally the versatility of this methodology across a diverse set of nonlinear conversion chains and initial conditions. We also provide experimental evidence of this framework producing picosecond-shaped, ultra-narrowband, near-transform limited light pulses from broadband, femtosecond input pulses, paving the way toward programmable lightwave shaping at GHz-to-THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-Induced Nonlinear Response in ZnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring terahertz waveforms in terahertz spectroscopy often relies on electrooptic sampling employing a ZnTe crystal. Although the nonlinearities in such zincblende semiconductors induced by intense terahertz pulses have been studied at optical frequencies, a quantitative study of nonlinearities in the terahertz regime has not been reported. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear response of ZnTe in the terahertz frequency region utilizing time-resolved terahertz-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We find that the interaction of two co-propagating terahertz pulses in ZnTe leads to a nonlinear polarization change which modifies the electro-optic response of the medium at terahertz frequencies. We present a model for this polarization that showcases the second-order nonlinear behavior. We also determine the magnitude of the third-order susceptibility in ZnTe at terahertz frequencies, $\chi^{\mathrm{(3)}}(\omega_\text{THz})$. These results clarify the interactions in ZnTe at terahertz frequencies, with implications for measurements of intense terahertz fields using electro-optic sampling.</description>

      <title>Coherent frequency combs from electrons colliding with a laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly coherent and powerful light sources capable of generating soft x-ray frequency combs are essential for high precision measurements and rigorous tests of fundamental physics. In this work, we derive the analytical conditions required for the emission of coherent radiation from an electron beam colliding with a laser pulse, modeled as a plane wave. These conditions are applied in a series of numerical simulations, where we show that a soft x-ray frequency comb can be produced if the electrons are regularly-spaced and sufficiently monoenergetic. High quality beams of this kind may be produced in the near future from laser-plasma interactions or linear accelerators. Furthermore, we highlight the advantageous role of employing few-cycle laser pulses in relaxing the stringent monoenergeticity requirements for coherent emission. The conditions derived here can also be used to optimize coherent emission in other frequency ranges, such as the terahertz domain.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Radiation from Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermal emitters that break the conventional Kirchhoff's law allow independent control of emissivity and absorptivity and promise exciting new functionalities in controlling heat flow for thermal and energy applications. In enabling some of these applications, nonreciprocal thermal emitters will unavoidably need to serve as hot emitters. Leveraging magneto-optical effects, degenerate semiconductors have been demonstrated as a promising optical material platform for nonreciprocal thermal radiation. However, existing modeling and experimental efforts are limited to near room temperature (&lt; 373 K), and it remains elusive whether nonreciprocal properties can persist at high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate strong nonreciprocal radiative properties at temperatures up to 600 K. We propose a theoretical model by considering the temperature dependence of the key parameters for the nonreciprocal behavior and experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the nonreciprocal properties of InAs, a degenerate semiconductor, using a customized angle-resolved high-temperature magnetic emissometry setup. Our theoretical model and experimental results show an agreement, revealing that strong nonreciprocity can persist at temperatures over 800 K for high-temperature stable semiconductors, enabling a pathway for nonreciprocal radiative heat flow control at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Inequality-free proof of Bell's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell's theorem supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. Most proofs of Bell's theorem, are based on inequalities. In this paper we present an alternative proof which does not involve inequalities, but only a direct comparison between correlation functions calculated using quantum mechanics on the one hand, and those calculated according to local realistic hidden-variable theories on the other. Our proof is based on a physically motivated use of Fourier series for periodic functions, and confirms that local realistic hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Exact steady state of quantum van der Pol oscillator: critical phenomena and enhanced metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the larger enhancement of the susceptibility than the standard deviation of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>
