      <title>Classifying the surface-knot modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$th module of a surface-knot of a genus $g$ in the 4-sphere is the
  $k$th integral homology module of the infinite cyclic covering of the surface-knot
  complement. The reduced first module is the quotient module of the first module by the finite
  sub-module defining the torsion linking. It is shown that the reduced first module for every
  genus $g$ is characterized in terms of properties of a finitely generated module. As a
  by-product, a concrete example of the fundamental group of a surface-knot of genus $g$
  which is not the fundamental group of any surface-knot of genus $g-1$ is given for every
  $g&gt;0$. The torsion part and the torsion-free part of the second module are determined by
  the reduced first module and the genus-class on the reduced first module. The third module
  vanishes. The concept of an exact leaf of a surface-knot is introduced, whose linking is an orthogonal sum of the torsion linking and a hyperbolic linking.</description>

      <title>Electric group for knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014 Andrey Perfiliev introduced the so-called electric invariant for non-oriented knots. This invariant was motivated by using Kirchhoff's laws for the dual graph of the knot diagram. Later, in 2020, Anastasiya Galkina generalised this invariant and defined the electric group for non-oriented knots. Both works were never written and published. In the present paper we describe a simple and general approach to the electric group for oriented knots and links. Each homomorphism from the electric group to an arbitrary finite group can be described by a proper colouring of the diagram. This colouring assigns an element of the group to each crossing of the diagram, and the proper conditions correspond to the areas of the diagram. In the second part of the paper we introduce tensor network invariants for coloured links. The idea of these invariants is very close to quantum invariants for classical links.</description>

      <title>On compact complex surfaces with finite homotopy rank-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological space (not necessarily simply connected) is said to have finite homotopy rank-sum if the sum of the ranks of all higher homotopy groups (from the second homotopy group onward) is finite. In this article, we characterize the smooth compact complex Kaehler surfaces having finite homotopy rank-sum. We also prove the Steinness of the universal cover of these surfaces assuming holomorphic convexity of the universal cover.</description>

      <title>From integrals to combinatorial formulas of finite type invariants -- a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a localized version of the configuration space integral for the Casson knot invariant, where the standard symmetric Gauss form is replaced with a locally supported form. An interesting technical difference between the arguments presented here and the classical arguments is that the vanishing of integrals over hidden and anomalous faces does not require the well known "involution tricks". The integral formula easily yields the well-known arrow diagram expression for regular knot diagrams, first presented in the work by Polyak and Viro. Moreover, it yields an arrow diagram count for the multicrossing knot diagrams, such as petal diagrams and gives a new lower bound for the {\em {\"u}bercrossing number}. Previously, the known arrow diagram formulas were applicable only to the regular knot diagrams.</description>

      <title>A filtered generalization of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new algebra associated to a Legendrian submanifold $\Lambda$ of a contact manifold of the form $\mathbb{R}_{t} \times W$, called the planar diagram algebra and denoted $PDA(\Lambda, \mathcal{P})$. It is a non-commutative, filtered, differential graded algebra whose filtered stable tame isomorphism class is an invariant of $\Lambda$ together with a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of its connected components. When $\Lambda$ is connected, $PDA$ is the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra. In general, the $PDA$ differential counts holomorphic disks with multiple positive punctures using a combinatorial framework inspired by string topology.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian filling for every cluster seed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that each cluster seed in the augmentation variety is inhabited by an embedded exact Lagrangian filling. This resolves the matter of surjectivity of the map from Lagrangian fillings to cluster seeds. The main new technique to produce these Lagrangian fillings is the construction and study of a quiver with potential associated to curve configurations. We prove that its deformation space is trivial and show how to use it to manipulate Lagrangian fillings with $\mathbb{L}$-compressing systems via Lagrangian disk surgeries.</description>

      <title>Surgery and Matter for 3d Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We try to give a geometric construction for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories using three-manifolds and Dehn surgeries. We follow the story that wrapping M5-branes on plumbing three-manifolds leads to 3d theories with mixed Chern-Simons levels. This construction can be decorated by adding non-compact Lagrangian submanifolds in the cotangent bundles of three-manifolds. The M5-branes wrapping on these submanifolds through M-theory/IIB string duality lead to flavor D5-branes that engineer chiral multiplets. In this note, we only consider unknotted matter circles, which are intersections between these non-compact M5-branes and plumbing manifolds. Then various dualities of 3d theories can be interpreted as Kirby moves and equivalent surgeries. We also find the dictionary between geometric structures of three-manifolds and physical aspects of gauge theories.</description>
