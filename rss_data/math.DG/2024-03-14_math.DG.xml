      <title>Large Steklov eigenvalues under volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we establish an expression for the Steklov spectrum of warped products in terms of auxiliary Steklov problems for drift Laplacians with weight induced by the warping factor. As an application, we show that a compact manifold with connected boundary diffeomorphic to a product admits a family of Riemannian metrics which coincide on the boundary, have fixed volume and arbitrarily large first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue. These are the first examples of Riemannian metrics with these properties on three-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>Gromoll--Meyer's actions and the geometry of (exotic) spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of new pairwise non-diffeomorphic structures on smooth manifolds, it has been questioned whether two topologically identical manifolds could admit different geometries. Not surprisingly, physicists have wondered whether a smooth structure assumption different from some classical known models could produce different physical meanings. In this paper, we inaugurate a very computational manner to produce physical models on classical and exotic spheres that can be built equivariantly, such as the classical Gromoll--Meyer exotic spheres. As first applications, we produce Lorentzian metrics on homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic manifolds that enjoy the same physical properties, such as geodesic completeness, positive Ricci curvature, and compatible time orientation. These constructions can be pulled back to higher models, such as exotic ten spheres bounding spin manifolds, to be approached in forthcoming papers.</description>

      <title>Local first integrals for stochastic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poincar\'{e}'s classical results [H. Poincar\'{e}, Sur l'int\'{e}gration des \'{e}quations diff\'{e}rentielles du premier order et du premier degr\'{e} I and II, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 5 (1891) 161-191; 11 (1897) 193-239] first provide a link between the existence of analytic first integrals and the resonant relations for analytic dynamical systems. In this paper, we show that by appropriately selecting the definition of the stochastic local first integrals, we are able to obtain the stochastic version of Poincar\'e non-integrability theorem. More specifically, we introduce two definitions of local first integrals for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the sense of probability one and expectation, respectively. We present the necessary conditions for the existence of functionally independent analytic or rational first integrals of SDEs via the resonances. We also show that for given integrable ordinary differential equations with some nondegeneracy conditions, there exists a linear stochastic perturbation such that the corresponding disturbed SDEs have no any analytic first integrals. Some examples are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Novel Boundary Conditions for the Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we want to deform a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary using Ricci flow, we first need to decide on appropriate boundary conditions. We would like these conditions to reflect the geometric nature of the flow and allow for a variety of initial data. Importantly, the conditions should be compatible with the expected evolution of Einstein metrics. We propose it is natural to choose those conditions, for which the first variation of certain functionals, such as the Einstein-Hilbert action and Perelmans lambda-functional, does not admit a boundary term. We provide a proof of the short term existence of solutions of the initial boundary value problem, under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Superintegrable systems on conformal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider non-degenerate second order superintegrable systems in dimension two as geometric structures on conformal surfaces. This extends a formalism developed by the authors, initially introduced for (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds of dimension three and higher. The governing equations of non-degenerate second order superintegrability in dimension two are structurally significantly different from those valid in higher dimensions. Specifically, we find conformally covariant structural equations, allowing one to classify the (conformal classes of) non-degenerate second order superintegrable systems on conformal surfaces geometrically. We then specialise to second order properly superintegrable systems on surfaces with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric and obtain structural equations in accordance with the known equations for Euclidean space. We finally give a single explicit set of purely algebraic equations defining the variety parametrising such systems on all constant curvature surfaces.</description>

      <title>Pinched theorem and the reverse Yau's inequalities for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 2$, we explicitly write the expression $-c_1^n(M)+\frac{2(n+1)}{n}c_2(M)c_1^{n-2}(M)$ in the form of certain integral on the holomorphic sectional curvature and its average at a fixed point in $M$ using the invariant theory. As applications, we get a reverse Yau's inequality and improve the classical $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem and negative $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds to smaller pinching constant depending only on the dimension and the first Chern class of $M$. If $M$ is not with positive or negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then there exists a point $x\in M$ such that the average of the holomorphic sectional curvature at $x$ vanishes. In particular, we characterise the $2$-dimensional complex torus by certain curvature condition. Moreover, we confirm Yau's conjecture for positive holomorphic sectional curvature and Siu-Yang's conjecture for negative holomorphic sectional curvature even for higher dimensions if the absolute value of the holomorphic sectional curvature is small enough. Finally, using the reverse Yau's inequality, we can judge if a projective manifold doesn't carry any hermitian metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>On locally symmetric polynomial metrics: Riemannian and Finslerian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we investigate locally symmetric polynomial metrics in special cases of Riemannian and Finslerian surfaces. The Riemannian case will be presented by a collection of basic results (regularity of second root metrics) and formulas up to Gauss curvature. In case of Finslerian surfaces we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for a locally symmetric fourth root metric in 2D to be positive definite. They are given in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial metric to make checking the positive definiteness as simple and direct as possible. Explicit examples are also presented. The situation is more complicated in case of spaces of dimension more than two. Some necessary conditions and an explicit example are given for a positive definite locally symmetric polynomial metric in 3D. Computations are supported by the MAPLE mathematics software (LinearAlgebra).</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators on Homogeneous vector bundles over compact homogeneous manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a global theory of subelliptic pseudo-differential operators on arbitrary homogeneous vector bundles over orientable compact homogeneous manifolds. We will show that a global pseudo-differential calculus can be associated to the operators acting on any pair of homogeneous vector-bundles with base space $M,$ if the compact Lie group $G$ that acts on $M=G/K$ is endowed with a (Riemannian or) sub-Riemannian structure. This is always possible if we choose on $G$ a sub-Laplacian associated to a H\"ormander system of vector-fields or we fix the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $G$. We begin with developing a global subelliptic symbolic calculus for vector-valued pseudo-differential operators on $G$ and then, we show that this vector-valued calculus induces a pseudo-differential calculus on homogeneous vector bundles, which, among other things, is stable under the action of the complex functional calculus. We prove global versions of the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem, Fefferman theorem and also, of the G\r{a}rding inequality. We present applications of the obtained G\r{a}rding inequality to the wellposedness of evolution problems. We characterise the classes of pseudo-differential operators on homogeneous vector bundles in the sense of H\"ormander (which are defined by using local coordinate systems) in terms of their global symbols. Finally, using this formalism, we compute the global symbol of the exterior derivative, its adjoint, and the symbol of the Dirac operator on the vector bundle of differential forms. We hope that this work will provide a solid foundation for further research using the global quantisation of operators on (vector-bundles over) compact homogeneous manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by Spidron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that Spidron has a 1-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing 1-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that the dynamical system can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>

      <title>From graph to Riesz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every graph continuous family of unbounded operators in a Hilbert space becomes Riesz continuous after multiplication by an appropriate family of unitary operators. This result provides a simple definition of the index for graph continuous families of Fredholm operators and leads to two corollaries for operators with compact resolvents: (1) the identity map between the spaces of such operators equipped with the Riesz and the graph topology is a homotopy equivalence; (2) every graph continuous family of such operators acting between fibers of Hilbert bundles becomes Riesz continuous in appropriate trivializations of the bundles.
  For self-adjoint operators, multiplication by unitary operators should be replaced by conjugation. In general, a graph continuous family of self-adjoint operators with compact resolvents cannot be made Riesz continuous by an appropriate conjugation. We obtain a partial analogue of the trivialization result above for self-adjoint operators and describe obstructions to existence of such a trivialization arising in the general case. This part of results is closely related to the recent work of N. Ivanov arXiv:2111.15081.</description>

We prove that any compact immersed anisotropic capillary constant anisotropic mean curvature hypersurface in the half-space is weakly stable if and only if it is a truncated Wulff shape. On the other hand, we prove a Bernstein-type theorem for stable anisotropic capillary minimal surfaces in the three dimensional half-space under Euclidean area growth assumption.</description>

Abstract: Weak contact metric manifolds, i.e., the linear complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, defined by the author and R. Wolak (2022), allowed a new look at the theory of contact manifolds. This article studies the curvature and topology of new structures of this type, called the weak nearly cosymplectic structure and weak nearly K\"{a}hler structure. We find conditions under which weak nearly cosymplectic manifolds become Riemannian products and characterize 5-dimensional weak nearly cosymplectic manifolds. Our theorems generalize results by H. Endo (2005) and A. Nicola-G. Dileo-I. Yudin (2018) on curvature and splitting of nearly cosymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13319v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of compact 4-manifolds with boundary that we call protocorks. Any exotic pair of simply connected closed 4-manifolds is related by a protocork twist, moreover, any cork is supported by a protocork. We prove a theorem on the relative Seiberg-Witten invariants of a protocork before and after twisting and a splitting theorem on the Floer homology of protocork boundaries. As a corollary we improve a theorem by Morgan and Szab\'{o} regarding the variation of Seiberg-Witten invariants with an upper bound which depends only on the topology of the data. Moreover, we generalize the result that only the reduced Floer homology of a cork boundary contributes to the variation of the Seiberg-Witten invariants under a cork twist to more general cut and paste operations where the pieces involved are $1$-connected and homeomorphic relative to the boundary.</description>
