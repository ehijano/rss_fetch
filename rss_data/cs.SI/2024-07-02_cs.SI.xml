      <title>Targeting influence in a harmonic opinion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence propagation in social networks is a central problem in modern social network analysis, with important societal applications in politics and advertising. A large body of work has focused on cascading models, viral marketing, and finite-horizon diffusion. There is, however, a need for more developed, mathematically principled \emph{adversarial models}, in which multiple, opposed actors strategically select nodes whose influence will maximally sway the crowd to their point of view.
  In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. We prove that our general problem is NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.</description>

      <title>An Exhaustive Study of Two-Node McCulloch-Pitts Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks are widely used in computational biology, evolutionary studies, and social sciences. However, the set of all Boolean-function-defined networks are harder to study as a whole. On the other hand, McCulloch-Pitts gates are sparsely parameterized using only a few number of link strengths, making it possible to study and compare different networks models. We treat two-node McCulloch-Pitts systems as a minimal complex system. When the link strengths are discretized, $3^4=81$ network models or rules are organized in the rule space The limiting dynamics of each rule may depend on the choice of binary state value ([-1,1] or [0,1]), and on the treatment at the threshold point, leading to at least six variants. One variant with [-1,1] as the binary state value (V1 model) tends to have a more diverse dynamical behaviors with a mixture of multiple cycles and fixed points at the limiting state, whereas other variants tend to fall only to fixed-point limiting dynamics. We use V1 models to study the organization of rules with different dynamics in the rule space and robustness of limiting dynamics with respect to a mutation in the rule table, as well as the related phenomena of phase transition and edge-of-chaos. We use another variant (V4 models) with only the fixed-point limiting dynamics to study the robustness of limiting state with respect to perturbation of initial states. The two types of robustness do not seem to be associated with each other. Other aspects of fully discretized two-node MaCulloch-Pitts networks are also studied, including: the proposal of a seventh variant based on a difference equation; relation to Rene Thomas' two types of feedback loops; spectrum properties of state space transition matrix; and asynchronous updating. Our works also expand the concept of network motifs by allowing more finer details.</description>

      <title>The Echoes of the 'I': Tracing Identity with Demographically Enhanced Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity is one of the most commonly studied constructs in social science. However, despite extensive theoretical work on identity, there remains a need for additional empirical data to validate and refine existing theories. This paper introduces a novel approach to studying identity by enhancing word embeddings with socio-demographic information. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces and extends established findings regarding gendered self-views. Our methodology can be applied in a wide variety of settings, allowing researchers to tap into a vast pool of naturally occurring data, such as social media posts. Unlike similar methods already introduced in computer science, our approach allows for the study of differences between social groups. This could be particularly appealing to social scientists and may encourage the faster adoption of computational methods in the field.</description>

      <title>The Uneven Impact of Mobility on the Segregation of Native and Foreign-born Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segregation is a key challenge in promoting more diverse and inclusive cities. Research based on smartphone data has revealed that segregation can extend beyond residential areas into everyday activities like visiting shops and restaurants. The impact of these activities on segregation, however, is unclear. Some studies suggest that they promote mixing, while others indicate they reinforce segregation. Here, we elucidate how day-to-day mobility shapes overall segregation levels, looking at the distinctive segregation experienced by native and foreign-born individuals. Our study is based on ~320,000 smartphone trajectories collected in Sweden, where immigration creates profound divides. We find that while mobility levels generally promote mixing for native-born individuals, foreign-born individuals remain segregated in their out-of-home activities. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that this heterogeneous effect of mobility on experienced segregation results mainly from two mechanisms: homophily and limited travel, i.e., foreign-born individuals (i) prefer destinations visited by similar individuals, and (ii) have limited mobility ranges. We show that homophily plays a minor role, while limited mobility, associated with reduced transport access, limits opportunities for foreign-born to diversify their encounters. Our findings reconcile conflicting literature and suggest that enhancing transport accessibility in foreign-born areas could reduce social segregation.</description>

      <title>EMIF: Evidence-aware Multi-source Information Fusion Network for Explainable Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research on automatic fake news detection has been conducted due to the significant detrimental effects of fake news proliferation. Most existing approaches rely on a single source of evidence, such as comments or relevant news, to derive explanatory evidence for decision-making, demonstrating exceptional performance. However, their single evidence source suffers from two critical drawbacks: (i) noise abundance, and (ii) resilience deficiency. Inspired by the natural process of fake news identification, we propose an Evidence-aware Multi-source Information Fusion (EMIF) network that jointly leverages user comments and relevant news to make precise decision and excavate reliable evidence. To accomplish this, we initially construct a co-attention network to capture general semantic conflicts between comments and original news. Meanwhile, a divergence selection module is employed to identify the top-K relevant news articles with content that deviates the most from the original news, which ensures the acquisition of multiple evidence with higher objectivity. Finally, we utilize an inconsistency loss function within the evidence fusion layer to strengthen the consistency of two types of evidence, both negating the authenticity of the same news. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on real-world dataset FibVID show the effectiveness of our proposed model. Notably, EMIF shows remarkable robustness even in scenarios where a particular source of information is inadequate.</description>

      <title>Applying the Ego Network Model to Cross-Target Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human interactions and social structures is an incredibly important task, especially in such an interconnected world. One task that facilitates this is Stance Detection, which predicts the opinion or attitude of a text towards a target entity. Traditionally, this has often been done mainly via the use of text-based approaches, however, recent work has produced a model (CT-TN) that leverages information about a user's social network to help predict their stance, outperforming certain cross-target text-based approaches. Unfortunately, the data required for such graph-based approaches is not always available. This paper proposes two novel tools for Stance Detection: the Ego Network Model (ENM) and the Signed Ego Network Model (SENM). These models are founded in anthropological and psychological studies and have been used within the context of social network analysis and related tasks (e.g., link prediction). Stance Detection predictions obtained using these features achieve a level of accuracy similar to the graph-based features used by CT-TN while requiring less and more easily obtainable data. In addition to this, the performances of the inner and outer circles of the ENM, representing stronger and weaker social ties, respectively are compared. Surprisingly, the outer circles, which contain more numerous but less intimate connections, are more useful for predicting stance.</description>

      <title>Social Isolation, Digital Connection: COVID-19's Impact on Twitter Ego Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most impactful measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in its early first years was the lockdown, implemented by governments to reduce physical contact among people and minimize opportunities for the virus to spread. As people were compelled to limit their physical interactions and stay at home, they turned to online social platforms to alleviate feelings of loneliness. Ego networks represent how people organize their relationships due to human cognitive constraints that impose limits on meaningful interactions among people. Physical contacts were disrupted during the lockdown, causing socialization to shift entirely online, leading to a shift in socialization into online platforms. Our research aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown measures on online ego network structures potentially caused by the increase of cognitive expenses in online social networks. In particular, we examined a large Twitter dataset of users, covering 7 years of their activities. We found that during the lockdown, there was an increase in network sizes and a richer structure in social circles, with relationships becoming more intimate. Moreover, we observe that, after the lockdown measures were relaxed, these features returned to their pre-lockdown values.</description>

      <title>How Clustering Affects the Convergence of Decentralized Optimization over Networks: A Monte-Carlo-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized algorithms have gained substantial interest owing to advancements in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent transportation networks, and parallel processing over sensor networks. The convergence of such algorithms is directly related to specific properties of the underlying network topology. Specifically, the clustering coefficient is known to affect, for example, the controllability/observability and the epidemic growth over networks. In this work, we study the effects of the clustering coefficient on the convergence rate of networked optimization approaches. In this regard, we model the structure of large-scale distributed systems by random scale-free (SF) and clustered scale-free (CSF) networks and compare the convergence rate by tuning the network clustering coefficient. This is done by keeping other relevant network properties (such as power-law degree distribution, number of links, and average degree) unchanged. Monte-Carlo-based simulations are used to compare the convergence rate over many trials of SF graph topologies. Furthermore, to study the convergence rate over real case studies, we compare the clustering coefficient of some real-world networks with the eigenspectrum of the underlying network (as a measure of convergence rate). The results interestingly show higher convergence rate over low-clustered networks. This is significant as one can improve the learning rate of many existing decentralized machine-learning scenarios by tuning the network clustering.</description>

      <title>Tracking the 2024 US Presidential Election Chatter on Tiktok: A Public Multimodal Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents our release of a large-scale data collection of TikTok posts related to the upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Our current data comprises 1.8 million videos published between November 1, 2023, and May 26, 2024. Its exploratory analysis identifies the most common keywords, hashtags, and bigrams in both Spanish and English posts, focusing on the election and the two main Presidential candidates, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
  We utilized the TikTok Research API, incorporating various election-related keywords and hashtags, to capture the full scope of relevant content. To address the limitations of the TikTok Research API, we also employed third-party scrapers to expand our dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/gabbypinto/US2024PresElectionTikToks</description>

      <title>Module control of network analysis in psychopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network approach to characterizing psychopathology departs from traditional latent categorical and dimensional approaches. Causal interplay among symptoms contributed to dynamic psychopathology system. Therefore, analyzing the symptom clusters is critical for understanding mental disorders. Furthermore, despite extensive research studying the topological features of symptom networks, the control relationships between symptoms remain largely unclear. Here, we present a novel systematizing concept, module control, to analyze the control principle of the symptom network at a module level. We introduce Module Control Network (MCN) to identify key modules that regulate the network's behavior. By applying our approach to a multivariate psychological dataset, we discover that non-emotional modules, such as sleep-related and stress-related modules, are the primary controlling modules in the symptom network. Our findings indicate that module control can expose central symptom cluster governing psychopathology network, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders and individualized approach to psychological interventions.</description>

      <title>Can GPT-4 Help Detect Quit Vaping Intentions? An Exploration of Automatic Data Annotation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the United States has witnessed a significant surge in the popularity of vaping or e-cigarette use, leading to a notable rise in cases of e-cigarette and vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that caused hospitalizations and fatalities during the EVALI outbreak in 2019, highlighting the urgency to comprehend vaping behaviors and develop effective strategies for cessation. Due to the ubiquity of social media platforms, over 4.7 billion users worldwide use them for connectivity, communications, news, and entertainment with a significant portion of the discourse related to health, thereby establishing social media data as an invaluable organic data resource for public health research. In this study, we extracted a sample dataset from one vaping sub-community on Reddit to analyze users' quit-vaping intentions. Leveraging OpenAI's latest large language model GPT-4 for sentence-level quit vaping intention detection, this study compares the outcomes of this model against layman and clinical expert annotations. Using different prompting strategies such as zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, we developed 8 prompts with varying levels of detail to explain the task to GPT-4 and also evaluated the performance of the strategies against each other. These preliminary findings emphasize the potential of GPT-4 in social media data analysis, especially in identifying users' subtle intentions that may elude human detection.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation and Secure Wireless Communication in the Large Model-based Mobile Edge Computing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large models and mobile edge computing, transfer learning, particularly through fine-tuning, has become crucial for adapting models to downstream tasks. Traditionally, this requires users to share their data with model owners for fine-tuning, which is not only costly but also raises significant privacy concerns. Furthermore, fine-tuning large-scale models is computationally intensive and often impractical for many users. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a system that combines offsite-tuning with physical-layer security, which provides local data owners with a lightweight adapter and a compressed emulator. Data owners then fine-tune the adapter locally and securely send it back to the model owners through a confidential channel for integration, ensuring privacy and resource conservation. Our paper focuses on optimizing computational resource allocation among data owners and the large model owner deployed on edge, and on the compression ratio of adapters. We incorporate a secrecy uplink channel to maximize the utility that we defined while minimizing system costs like energy consumption and delay. The optimization uses the Dinkelbach algorithm, fractional programming, successive convex approximation and alternating optimization. Experiments demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>

      <title>Finding Hidden Swing Voters in the 2022 Italian Elections Twitter Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global proliferation of social media platforms has transformed political communication, making the study of online interactions between politicians and voters crucial for understanding contemporary political discourse. In this work, we examine the dynamics of political messaging and voter behavior on Twitter during the 2022 Italian general elections. Specifically, we focus on voters who changed their political preferences over time (swing voters), identifying significant patterns of migration and susceptibility to propaganda messages. Our analysis reveals that during election periods, the popularity of politicians increases, and there is a notable variation in the use of persuasive language techniques, including doubt, loaded language, appeals to values, and slogans. Swing voters are more vulnerable to these propaganda techniques compared to non-swing voters, with differences in vulnerability patterns across various types of political shifts. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of social media on political opinion in Italy.</description>

      <title>From News Sharers to Post Viewers: How Topic Diversity and Conspiracy Theories Shape Engagement With Misinformation During a Health Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engagement with misinformation on social media poses unprecedented threats to societal well-being, particularly during health crises when susceptibility to misinformation is heightened in a multi-topic context. This paper focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses a critical gap in understanding online engagement with multi-topic misinformation at two user levels: news sharers who share source news items on social media and post viewers who engage with online news posts. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 7273 fact-checked source news claims related to COVID-19 and their associated posts on X, through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. We find that false news, particularly when accompanied by conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity than true news. At the news sharer level, false news has a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news. Additionally, the integration of conspiracy theories is significantly associated with a longer lifetime for COVID-19 misinformation. However, topic diversity has no significant association with news sharer engagement in terms of news lifetime and the number of posts. At the post viewer level, contrary to the news sharer level, news posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more replies compared to false news posts without conspiracy theories. Our findings suggest that news sharers and post viewers exhibit different engagement patterns on social media regarding topic diversity and conspiracy theories, offering valuable insights into designing targeted misinformation intervention strategies at both user levels.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted ads, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Reduction: Sparsification, Coarsening, and Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets can be naturally represented as graphs, spanning a wide range of domains. However, the increasing complexity and size of graph datasets present significant challenges for analysis and computation. In response, graph reduction, or graph summarization, has gained prominence for simplifying large graphs while preserving essential properties. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of graph reduction methods, including graph sparsification, graph coarsening, and graph condensation. Specifically, we establish a unified definition for these methods and introduce a hierarchical taxonomy to categorize the challenges they address. Our survey then systematically reviews the technical details of these methods and emphasizes their practical applications across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we outline critical research directions to ensure the continued effectiveness of graph reduction techniques, as well as provide a comprehensive paper list at \url{https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-graph-reduction}. We hope this survey will bridge literature gaps and propel the advancement of this promising field.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Indicator of Polarization to Measure Online Sexism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The online trend of the manosphere and feminist discourse on social networks requires a holistic measure of the level of sexism in an online community. This indicator is important for policymakers and moderators of online communities (e.g., subreddits) and computational social scientists, either to revise moderation strategies based on the degree of sexism or to match and compare the temporal sexism across different platforms and communities with real-time events and infer social scientific insights.
  In this paper, we build a model that can provide a comparable holistic indicator of toxicity targeted toward male and female identity and male and female individuals. Despite previous supervised NLP methods that require annotation of toxic comments at the target level (e.g. annotating comments that are specifically toxic toward women) to detect targeted toxic comments, our indicator uses supervised NLP to detect the presence of toxicity and unsupervised word embedding association test to detect the target automatically.
  We apply our model to gender discourse communities (e.g., r/TheRedPill, r/MGTOW, r/FemaleDatingStrategy) to detect the level of toxicity toward genders (i.e., sexism). Our results show that our framework accurately and consistently (93% correlation) measures the level of sexism in a community. We finally discuss how our framework can be generalized in the future to measure qualities other than toxicity (e.g. sentiment, humor) toward general-purpose targets and turn into an indicator of different sorts of polarizations.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph representation learning. Unfortunately, current weight assignment schemes in standard GNNs, such as the calculation based on node degrees or pair-wise representations, can hardly be effective in processing the networks with heterophily, in which the connected nodes usually possess different labels or features. Existing heterophilic GNNs tend to ignore the modeling of heterophily of each edge, which is also a vital part in tackling the heterophily problem. In this paper, we firstly propose a heterophily-aware attention scheme and reveal the benefits of modeling the edge heterophily, i.e., if a GNN assigns different weights to edges according to different heterophilic types, it can learn effective local attention patterns, which enable nodes to acquire appropriate information from distinct neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network (HA-GAT) by fully exploring and utilizing the local distribution as the underlying heterophily, to handle the networks with different homophily ratios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HA-GAT, we analyze the proposed heterophily-aware attention scheme and local distribution exploration, by seeking for an interpretation from their mechanism. Extensive results demonstrate that our HA-GAT achieves state-of-the-art performances on eight datasets with different homophily ratios in both the supervised and semi-supervised node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems in fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences often involve interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise ones. Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges, delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs' states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states, with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.</description>

      <title>A Two-Part Machine Learning Approach to Characterizing Network Interference in A/B Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliability of controlled experiments, commonly referred to as "A/B tests," is often compromised by network interference, where the outcomes of individual units are influenced by interactions with others. Significant challenges in this domain include the lack of accounting for complex social network structures and the difficulty in suitably characterizing network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning-based method. We introduce "causal network motifs" and utilize transparent machine learning models to characterize network interference patterns underlying an A/B test on networks. Our method's performance has been demonstrated through simulations on both a synthetic experiment and a large-scale test on Instagram. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms conventional methods such as design-based cluster randomization and conventional analysis-based neighborhood exposure mapping. Our approach provides a comprehensive and automated solution to address network interference for A/B testing practitioners. This aids in informing strategic business decisions in areas such as marketing effectiveness and product customization.</description>

Abstract: The influence of opinion leaders impacts different aspects of social finance. How to analyse the utility of opinion leaders' influence in realizing assets on the blockchain and adopt a compliant regulatory scheme is worth exploring and pondering. Taking Musk's call on social media to buy Dogecoin as an example, this paper uses an event study to empirically investigate the phenomenon in which opinion leaders use ICOs (initial coin offerings) to exert influence. The results show that opinion leaders can use ICOs to influence the price of token assets with money and data traffic in their social network. They can obtain excess returns and reduce the cost of realization so that the closed loop of influence realization will be accelerated. Based on this phenomenon and the results of its impact, we use the ChainLink Oracle with Active Sensor Networks(CO-ASnet) to design a safe and applicable decentralized regulatory scheme that can constructively provide risk assessment strategies and early warning measures for token issuance. The influence realization of opinion leaders in blockchain issuance is bound to receive widespread attention, and this paper will provide an exemplary reference for regulators and enterprises to explore the boundaries of blockchain financial product development and governance.</description>

      <title>Novel Node Category Detection Under Subpopulation Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world graph data, distribution shifts can manifest in various ways, such as the emergence of new categories and changes in the relative proportions of existing categories. It is often important to detect nodes of novel categories under such distribution shifts for safety or insight discovery purposes. We introduce a new approach, Recall-Constrained Optimization with Selective Link Prediction (RECO-SLIP), to detect nodes belonging to novel categories in attributed graphs under subpopulation shifts. By integrating a recall-constrained learning framework with a sample-efficient link prediction mechanism, RECO-SLIP addresses the dual challenges of resilience against subpopulation shifts and the effective exploitation of graph structure. Our extensive empirical evaluation across multiple graph datasets demonstrates the superior performance of RECO-SLIP over existing methods. The experimental code is available at https://github.com/hsinghuan/novel-node-category-detection.</description>

Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>Network Structure Trumps Neuron Dynamics: Insights from Drosophila Connectome Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of artificial neural networks, the necessity of real network structures in simulating intelligence remains unclear. Utilizing the largest adult Drosophila connectome data set, we constructed a large-scale network communication model framework based on simple neuronal activation mechanisms to simulate the activation behavior observed in the connectome. The results demonstrate that even with simple propagation rules, models based on real neural network structures can generate activation patterns similar to those in the actual brain. Importantly, we found that using different neuronal dynamics models, all produced similar activation patterns. This consistency across different models emphasizes the crucial role of network topology in neural information processing, challenging views that rely solely on neuron count or complex individual neuron dynamics.Moreover, we test the influence of network reconnect rate and find that even 1%'s reconnect rate will ruin the activation patterns appeared before. By comparing network distances and spatial distances, we found that network distance better explains the information propagation patterns between neurons, highlighting the importance of topological structure in neural information processing. To facilitate these studies, we developed real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software, bridging a crucial gap in existing tools. Our findings underscore the importance of network structure in neural activation and provide new insights into the fundamental principles governing brain functionality.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Feature and Topology Lightweighting: An Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression Method for Malicious Account Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ethereum has become one of the primary global platforms for cryptocurrency, playing an important role in promoting the diversification of the financial ecosystem. However, the relative lag in regulation has led to a proliferation of malicious activities in Ethereum, posing a serious threat to fund security. Existing regulatory methods usually detect malicious accounts through feature engineering or large-scale transaction graph mining. However, due to the immense scale of transaction data and malicious attacks, these methods suffer from inefficiency and low robustness during data processing and anomaly detection. In this regard, we propose an Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression method named TGC4Eth, which assists malicious account detection by lightweighting both features and topology of the transaction graph. At the feature level, we select transaction features based on their low importance to improve the robustness of the subsequent detection models against feature evasion attacks; at the topology level, we employ focusing and coarsening processes to compress the structure of the transaction graph, thereby improving both data processing and inference efficiency of detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGC4Eth significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing detection models while preserving the connectivity of the transaction graph. Furthermore, TGC4Eth enables existing detection models to maintain stable performance and exhibit high robustness against feature evasion attacks.</description>
