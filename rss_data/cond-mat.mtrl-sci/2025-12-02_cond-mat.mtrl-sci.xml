      <title>Topological passivation makes high strength alloys insensitive to hydrogen embrittlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure parts for a hydrogen (H) economy need alloys that are mechanically strong and at the same time resistant to the most dangerous and abrupt type of failure mode, namely, H embrittlement. These two properties are in fundamental conflict, as increasing strength typically amplifies susceptibility to H-related failure. Here, we introduce a new approach to make alloys resistant to H embrittlement, by creating a topological passivation layer (up to a few hundred micrometers thick) near the material surface, the region that is most vulnerable to H ingress and attack. It features instead a layer of ultrafine laminated grains with tens of times higher dislocation density than conventional materials, altering H diffusion, trapping and crack evolution. We tested the concept on a face-centered cubic (FCC) CoCrNi medium entropy model alloy which undergoes severe H-induced intergranular cracking. Two key mechanisms create the topological passivation: First, the high density (up to ~1.3e15 m-2) of H-trapping dislocations within the passivating grain layer decelerates H migration by up to about an order of magnitude, delaying H-induced crack initiation at grain boundaries. More importantly, once unavoidable micro-sized H-induced intergranular cracks emerge in the topmost surface region, they become completely arrested by the laminated grains, due to a transition in the embrittlement mechanism from H-enhanced grain boundary decohesion to highly energy-dissipative dislocation-associated cracking. These effects almost completely eliminate H embrittlement, at even doubled yield strength, when exposing the so architected material to harsh H attack. Our approach leverages surface mechanical treatments to tailor metallic microstructures in surface regions most susceptible to H attack, providing a scalable solution to protect alloys from H-induced damage.</description>

      <title>Generic rigidity and accidental modes in metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine high porosity with structural fragility, raising important questions about their mechanical stability. We develop a rigidity-based framework in which spring networks parameterized by UFF4MOF are used to construct rigidity and dynamical matrices. Large-scale analysis of 5,682 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database shows that most frameworks are formally over-constrained yet cluster sharply near the isostatic threshold, revealing accidental geometric modes and placing many MOFs near mechanical instability. In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable. This near-criticality mirrors behavior known from topological mechanics and points to a deeper design principle in porous crystals.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Classifying Structure and Magnetism in Delafossite Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delafossites (ABC2, where A and B are metals and C is a chalcogen) are a versatile family of quantum materials and layered oxides/chalcogenides whose properties are highly sensitive to atomic composition and stacking geometry. Their broad chemical tunability makes them an ideal platform for large-scale combinatorial exploration and high-throughput computational screening with desirable quantum properties. In this work, we employ a Concept Whitening Graph Neural Network, a gray-box AI model, to classify delafossite structures by stacking sequence and magnetic states. By aligning learned representations with human-interpretable physical concepts, this gray-box approach enables both accurate prediction and insight into the structural and chemical features driving magnetic behavior. The magnetic-ordering models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 80 percent, with a further slight uptick observed in the model incorporating the largest number of concepts. Concept alignment analysis revealed measurable learning across nine physically meaningful descriptors, with coefficients of determination ranging from approximately 0.6 for the d-shell valence-electron concepts to 0.4-0.5 for the magnetic coupling parameters. Furthermore, we mapped the concept importances onto the material graph representation, elucidating interpretable physical trends and the progression of stable concept-aligned regions across training. These results demonstrate the potential of interpretable graph-based learning to capture the underlying physics of complex materials systems and provide an interpretable framework for accelerating the discovery and understanding of delafossites and related crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous and Topological Hall Responses in an Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Nodal-Line metal Fe5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between real and reciprocal space topology yields intrinsically linked transport phenomena in magnetic Weyl systems, wherein the broken time-reversal symmetry, strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and pronounced uniaxial anisotropy stabilize the momentum-space Berry-curvature monopoles (Weyl nodes) and real-space chiral spin textures. We present a combined first-principles and experimental study of epitaxial Fe5Si3 thin films, establishing them as a magnetic Weyl nodal-line material. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unambiguously reveal that Fe5Si3 hosts a topologically nontrivial electronic structure containing six pairs of Weyl nodes at or near the Fermi level, accompanied by pronounced Berry curvature at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin Zone. High-quality epitaxial films exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ~370 K and strong magneto crystalline anisotropy. The magneto transport measurements on epitaxial films reveal the corresponding Berry curvature-driven responses, including a significantly large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 504 S/cm and a high anomalous Hall angle of 5.5%, which is in good agreement with DFT calculations. A negative and non-saturating longitudinal magnetoresistance is observed, consistent with a chiral-anomaly contribution from Weyl fermions near the Fermi level (EF). Furthermore, a substantial topological Hall resistivity of 1.6 {\mu}{\Omega} cm robust across a wide temperature range, indicating the possibility of robust chiral spin textures in the thin-film geometry. These combined theoretical and experimental results establish Fe5Si3 as a unique, low-cost, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl nodal-line material, providing a versatile platform for exploring coupled real and reciprocal space topologies in topological spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic and isotropic elasticity and thermal transport in monolayer C$_{24}$ networks from machine-learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional fullerene networks have recently attracted increasing interest due to their diverse bonding topologies and mechanically robust architectures. In this work, we develop an accurate machine-learned potential NEP-C$_{24}$ for both the quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) and the quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) C$_{24}$ monolayers, based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework. Using this NEP-C$_{24}$ model, we systematically investigate the elastic and thermal transport properties. Compared with C$_{60}$ monolayers, both C$_{24}$ phases exhibit markedly enhanced stiffness, arising from the combination of reduced molecular size and increased density of covalent bonds. The qTP C$_{24}$ monolayer shows nearly isotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivities along its two principal axes owing to its four-fold symmetry, whereas the chain-like, misaligned bonding topology of the qHP C$_{24}$ monolayer leads to pronounced in-plane anisotropy. Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and spectral decomposition analyses reveal that low-frequency ($&lt;5$ THz) acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, with directional variations in phonon group velocity and mean free path governing the anisotropic response in qHP C$_{24}$. Real-space heat flow visualizations further show that, in these fullerene networks, phonon transport is dominated by strong inter-fullerene covalent bonds rather than weak van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a direct link between intermolecular bonding topology and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing guidance for the rational design of fullerene-based two-dimensional materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties.</description>

      <title>A Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition System for Fast Synthesis of Epitaxial Graphene Under Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a promising material for next-generation electronic and thermal devices owing to its exceptional charge transport and thermal conductivity. However, high-quality samples are predominantly obtained via mechanical exfoliation from graphite crystals, a process that inherently lacks scalability. Despite extensive efforts toward large-area synthesis, cost-effective approaches for producing high-quality, large-area, single-crystalline graphene with fast turnaround time remain limited. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance benchmarking of a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system capable of synthesizing epitaxial monolayer graphene under atmospheric pressure. The entire growth process, from sample loading to unloading, is achieved within $25$ minutes with a temperature ramp rate exceeding $23^\circ\mathrm{C}/s$. Growth at atmospheric pressure eliminates the need for vacuum components, thereby reducing both system complexity and operational costs. The structural and electronic quality of epitaxial graphene is comprehensively characterized using Raman spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and magnetotransport measurements, which reveal signatures of quantum Hall effect in synthesized graphene samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate van der Waals epitaxial growth of palladium (Pd) thin films on graphene transferred to Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates, establishing its single-crystalline nature over a large area and its potential as a versatile platform for subsequent heteroepitaxial growth.</description>

      <title>Dual Role of Nb in Defect-Mediated Strength and Ductility of {\gamma}-TiAl Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the superior high-temperature strength of {\gamma}-TiAl with high Nb addition remains highly controversial, largely due to the unclear role of Nb atoms. Using large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a self-developed neural network potential,we show that Nb atoms predominantly occupy Ti sites and form short-range order with neighboring Al atoms, but a non-negligible fraction also occupies Al sites (NbAl) and promotes the formation of antisite defects (TiAl). Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity. Meanwhile, these substitutional and antisite defects also increase the Peierls stress of both screw and edge dislocations, which hinders dislocation motion to cause pronounced solid-solution strengthening. This work provides mechanistic insights into the dual role of Nb in enhancing both strength and ductility in {\gamma}-TiAl and further offers guidance for defect and composition engineering in advanced alloy systems.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical investigation of silicon wafer dynamics within the melting regime driven by picosecond laser pulses for surface structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on silicon, generated by ultrashort pulsed lasers, provide an efficient means to tailor surface functionality. This work presents a multiphysics finite element study on the thermomechanical dynamics of silicon wafers irradiated by picosecond laser pulses, focusing on the melting regime where thermomechanical and hydrodynamic effects dominate. To illustrate the sequential nature of laser scanning, single-pulse irradiation models are developed as thermomechanical analogues of double-pulse interactions. By positioning the laser focus near reflective boundaries and corners of the target, these models reproduce the stress-wave interference that would occur between successive pulses in scanning. The results show that periodic surface structures originate from mechanical standing wave interference within the molten layer, forming ripples with near-wavelength periodicity. The penetration depth (PD) is identified as a key factor controlling the duration and stability of these ripples: shallow PDs (75-150 nm) yield distinct, persistent patterns, while deeper PDs (app. 2.5 micrometers) lead to extended melting and hydrodynamic smoothing. Simulations of sequential double-pulse irradiation confirm that residual stresses and strains from the first pulse amplify deformation during the second, enhancing ripple amplitude and uniformity. Controlled excitation of mechanical standing waves governed by PD, boundary geometry, and pulse sequencing - thus represents a fundamental mechanism for deterministic LIPSS formation on silicon.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave emission with current-controlled frequency by a PMA-based spin-Hall oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-torque and spin-Hall oscillators (SHOs) have emerged as promising candidates for building blocks in neuromorphic computing due to their ability to synchronize mutually, a process that can be mediated by propagating spin waves. We demonstrate a SHO that takes advantage of a low-damping magnetic garnet with dominant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), namely gallium-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (Ga:YIG). In-plane magnetized Ga:YIG allows for the operation at a high efficiency level while also enabling resonant spin-wave emission. A nonlinear self-localization of the excitation is avoided by exploiting the positive nonlinear frequency shift, which facilitates a current-controlled frequency of the emitted spin waves. Via micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we investigate the properties of the local auto-oscillation and its spin-wave emission. Multiple modes are excited and compete internally, with two propagating modes detected up to distances larger than \SI{10}{\micro\meter}. Their frequencies combine to an extended frequency bandwidth of approximately \SI{1.6}{\giga\hertz}. The experimentally observed two-mode system and its transition to a single mode at higher currents are reproduced via micromagnetic simulations, which account for spatial variation of the PMA arising due to the microstructures on Ga:YIG. Our results propose a promising platform for hosting SHOs, interconnected via propagating spin waves with particular relevance to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Carrier localization and dynamics in In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N: the impact of alloying and Si doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electric Polarization from Nonpolar Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Born effective charge (BEC), a fundamental quantity in lattice dynamics and ferroelectric theory, provides a quantitative measure of linear polarization response to ionic displacements. However, it does not account for higher-order effects, which can play a significant role in certain materials, such as fluorite HfO$_2$. In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that drives polarization in crystalline solids, offering new insights into the design principles of next-generation ferroelectric, piezoelectric and multifunctional materials.</description>

      <title>Resonant states and nuclear dynamics in solid-state systems: the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</description>

      <title>A Dimensionally Consistent Size-Strain Plot Method for Crystallite Size and Microstrain Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of elasto-optical properties of $R$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00726v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides ($R$Te$_3$) exhibit complex charge-density-wave (CDW) phases intertwined with lattice symmetry, offering a platform to explore unconventional symmetry breaking in correlated materials. Elasto-optical probing, which detects strain-induced changes in birefringence, provides a non-invasive approach to visualize anisotropy and emergent order in these quasi-two-dimensional systems. However, the magnitude and symmetry of the expected optical response remain poorly quantified, hindering experimental interpretation. Here, we perform first-principles calculations of the elastic, dielectric, and piezo-optical tensors of NdTe$_3$ to establish a quantitative framework for strain-induced optical anisotropy. These results establish a quantitative link between lattice strain and optical response in $R$Te$_3$, providing a predictive framework for probing symmetry-breaking states via elasto-birefringence.</description>

      <title>Universal Fabrication of Graphene/Perovskite Oxide Hybrid Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures composed of graphene and perovskite oxides provide a promising platform for exploiting synergetic interfacial functionalities. Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling. Our work establishes a reproducible, transfer-free fabrication route for graphene/perovskite oxide hybrid heterostructures and provides empirical support for the universal growth of graphene on insulating substrates.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Correlation Functionals in 2D Materials: Applications, Challenges, and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has reshaped modern nanoscience, offering properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts. As experimental discovery accelerates, the need for reliable computational techniques has become increas- ingly important. Within the framework of density functional theory, this review explores the critical role of exchange-correlation functionals in predicting key material properties such as structural, optoelectronic, magnetic, and thermal. We examine the challenges posed by quantum confinement, anisotropic screening, and van der Waals interactions, which conventional functionals often fail to describe. Advanced approaches, including meta-GGA, hybrid functionals, and many-body perturbation theory (e.g., GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation), are assessed for their improved accuracy in capturing electronic structure and excitonic effects. We further discuss the non-universality of functionals across different 2D material families and the emerging role of machine learning to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the review outlines current limitations and emerging strategies, providing a roadmap for advancing exchange-correlation functionals and beyond, to enable the practical design and application of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Charge state equilibration of nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles in diamond: The role of electron tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge state stability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers critically affects their application as quantum sensors and qubits. Understanding charge state conversion and equilibration is critical not only for NV centers in diamond but also for defects and impurities in wide-bandgap materials in general. The mechanisms by which these centers change charge state upon optical or electronic excitation without the presence of mobile carriers remain unclear, potentially affecting the performance of applications ranging from phosphors to power electronics. Here, we elucidate this issue for the case of photoionization of NV center ensembles. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, we ionize negatively charged NV centers and monitor the recovery of $\NVm$ on timescales of up to several seconds. We find that the recovery rate depends strongly on the concentration of surrounding nitrogen donors. Remarkably, the equilibration dynamics exhibit no discernible dependence on temperature, ruling out thermally activated processes. The multiphonon-assisted electron tunneling model, supported by density-functional calculations, explains the measurements and identifies tunneling as the equilibration mechanism.</description>

      <title>Observation of hidden altermagnetism in Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are characterized by anisotropic band/spin splittings in momentum space, dictated by their spin-space group symmetries. However, the real-space modulations of altermagnetism are often neglected and have not been explored experimentally. Here we combine neutron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and density functional theory to demonstrate that Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O realizes a spatially modulated form of altermagnetism, i.e., hidden altermagnetism. Such a state in Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O results from its G-type antiferromagnetism and two-dimensional electronic states, allowing for the development of spatially alternating altermagnetic layers, whose local spin polarizations are directly verified by spin-resolved ARPES measurements. Our experimental discovery of hidden altermagnetism broadens the scope of unconventional magnetism and opens routes to exploring emergent phenomena from real-space modulations of altermagnetic order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Crystalyse, an open, provenance-enforced scientific agent for computational materials design of inorganic crystals that orchestrates tools for compositional screening, crystal structure generation, and machine-learning force-field evaluation. Crystalyse offers three operating modes to trade exploration speed against validation depth: creative (rapid query), adaptive (context-aware routing) and rigorous (comprehensive checks). We release the underlying source code and evaluation scripts to enable plug-and-play use and development. In demonstrations on quaternary oxide exploration, sodium-ion cathode design, and lead-free indoor photovoltaic candidate generation, the agent integrates chemical compound generation with fast stability and property filters. Under adversarial testing, provenance enforcement eliminated material-property hallucinations (a broad adversarial suite pass rate reached 86% from a 57% baseline). Crystalyse provides an agentic artificial intelligence system that can complement existing materials design pipelines, assisting in hypothesis generation while preserving transparency and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Jahn-Teller Distortions and Dynamic Lattice Polarizability as the Origin of Broadband Emission in Bi3+-Doped Cs2SnCl6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free vacancy-ordered perovskites (VOHPs) such as Cs2SnCl6 have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications but typically suffer from wide band gaps and low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). In this work, the electronic origins of broadband blue emission in Bi3+-doped Cs2SnCl6 are elucidated by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The study systematically explores the spatial configurations of Bi3+ dopants and Cl- vacancies, assessing their impact on structural and electronic properties. Results demonstrate that the formation of square pyramidal BiCl5(2-) units serves as efficient exciton traps, fundamentally enabling strong luminescence in an otherwise non-emitting host. The Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair in an asymmetric coordination environment drives second-order Jahn-Teller distortions, creating a highly polarizable local lattice. This softness, in contrast to the rigid SnCl6(2-) framework, produces heterogeneous distributions of bond lengths, bond angles, and band edges around dopant sites. Defect-induced states strongly localize charge carriers, while coupling to vibrational modes at 300 K dynamically broadens the band edges, accounting for the large Stokes shift and broadband photoluminescence. These results establish lone-pair-driven Jahn-Teller distortions and lattice heterogeneity as key design principles for efficient luminescence in lead-free perovskites.</description>

      <title>On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of X2NiH6 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.</description>

      <title>Building Trustworthy AI for Materials Discovery: From Autonomous Laboratories to Z-scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed "AI/ML". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.</description>

      <title>Aging-driven in situ polymerization of FEC additive boosts the calendar-life of silicon anodes via surface passivation enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of additives such as FEC in extending the calendar life of silicon anodes beyond the cycling benefits is still not fully understood. Herein, the calendar life of high-loading Si (80 wt%) using baseline 1.2 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC electrolyte versus adding 10 wt% FEC is investigated over months. Over 8 days of aging, FEC leads to a 13-fold reduction in irreversible capacity loss in Si-LiFePO4 full cells. Cells without FEC are projected to fall below 80% of their initial capacity within approx. 22 days versus approx. 279 days with FEC. Symmetric Si-Si cells from harvested electrodes show greater increase in interphase resistance without FEC, whereby an increase of 10.81 Ohms is measured for 0 wt% FEC vs. only 3.37 Ohms for 10 wt% FEC over 2 months. Power law modeling of this long-term interphase resistance finds mixed transport-reaction growth behavior in FEC-free cells, suggesting significant dissolution, whereas cells with 10 wt% FEC added display a diffusion-controlled impedance growth behavior, suggesting a robust surface passivation film. Post-mortem FTIR and XPS confirm polycarbonate enrichment of the SEI, which was discovered to predominantly emerge from FEC self-polymerization during the idle aging. When the Si electrodes aged with and without FEC are harvested and reassembled into full cells with the same electrolytes used at aging, the first-cycle coulombic efficiency is 71% for 0 wt% FEC versus 97% for 10 wt% FEC. Subsequent cycling maintains over 99.7% CE with 10 wt% FEC, surpassing the pre-aging CE of 98.8%. This elevated CE indicates better passivation provided by the polymer fragments formed during aging compared to electrochemically formed SEI where no strong polymer FTIR signal is found. The self-polymerization during idle aging with additives such as FEC is therefore an opportune in situ mechanism to further engineer in extending the life of Si-based batteries.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the spin-splitting in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, have recently emerged as a promising platform for spintronics. However, their microscopic mechanisms remain elusive, often relying on abstract group theory. In this work, we present an intuitive and pedagogical framework to understand the origin of spin splitting in altermagnets. We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2. By demystifying the microscopic origins of altermagnetism, our work bridges symmetry analysis and material realizations, shedding light on practical designs of altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Competing Lattice and Defect Dynamics Govern Terahertz-Induced Ferroelectricity in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) pulses induce transient inversion-symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, yet the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Using fields up to $\sim$1.1 MV/cm, we reveal spatially inhomogeneous THz-field-induced second harmonic generation (TFISH) governed by competing lattice and defect dynamics. Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions. Collective modes manifested by oscillatory TFISH components exhibit softening followed by hardening below a critical temperature $T^*\simeq$28 K, confirming transient ferroelectric order where defects are sparse. These results reconcile conflicting interpretations, establish defect-mediated competition as a central regulator of light-induced ferroelectricity, and open routes to ultrafast control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary cation-replace-cation antisite defect predominate in Bi2SeO5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a newly identified single-crystalline van der Waals dielectric with a high dielectric constant, Bi2SeO5 plays a pivotal role in advancing 2D electronic devices. In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Predicting cement microstructure and mechanical properties in hydrating cement paste with a Phase-Field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the evolving microstructure of hydrating cement is essential for understanding and modeling its mechanical property development. Physics-based continuum approaches offer a rigorous framework for capturing the thermodynamics of dissolution and precipitation processes at the microstructural scale. In this work, we present an adapted Phase-Field (PF) model for cement hydration that resolves key physical inconsistencies in existing PF formulations by introducing a revised free-energy potential and distinct equilibrium constants for clinker dissolution and hydrate precipitation. The resulting PF framework reproduces microstructural evolution, yielding realistic porosity levels and continuous phase boundaries in close agreement with experimental observations. The predicted hydrated microstructures are subsequently used in a computational homogenization scheme to evaluate the elastic response of the material. The PF-derived mechanical properties show good agreement with experimental trends, supporting the ability of the proposed framework to consistently link hydration chemistry, microstructure formation, and the resulting mechanical response.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Thermal Properties of Cu-Au Janus Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the thermal and structural properties of Cu-Au (Copper-Gold) Janus nanoparticles with a diameter of 5 nm are investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within the interactions defined by the many-body embedded atom model (EAM). A set of nanoparticle models has been constructed, with varying Cu and Au ratios. MD method is carried out to calculate the melting temperature, heat capacity, radial distribution function (RDF), Lindemann index, mean square displacement (MSD), and diffusion coefficients of these models. The findings demonstrate that nanoparticles rich in Cu exhibit a higher melting temperature and more defined phase transitions. In contrast, structures rich in gold exhibited reduced melting temperatures and showed surface-initiated melting behaviours. MD study highlights that the thermal stability and atomic mobility of Cu-Au Janus nanoparticles depend on the composition ratio and the dispersion of materials.</description>

      <title>Silver Alloyed Wide Bandgap (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 Thin Film Solar Cells With 15.5% Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfide chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) is a wide bandgap semiconductor suitable for the top cell of a tandem solar device. Here we demonstrate significant improvements in absorber quality by alloying with Ag to form (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 (ACIGS) absorbers. We report the Ag alloying effect on compositional, structural, and optoelectronic properties of absorbers. We demonstrate suppressed bulk recombination and improved carrier lifetime in ACIGS, as a result of improved grain size, porosity reduction and defect passivation. We also show that Ag alloying flattens the Ga gradient. Consideration of this impact of Ag will be necessary in future engineering of the Ga profile to maximize charge carrier collection and avoid interface recombination. Exploiting the beneficial effects of Ag alloying, we report a wide bandgap (1.58 eV) ACIGS solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency of 15.5% and a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 948 mV, improving on the reference pure CIGS solar cell, with an 11.2% efficiency and an 821 mV VOC. Ag alloying is a useful route to further increase the efficiency of CIGS solar cells and future tandem devices.</description>

      <title>Optical refractive index measurements of AlGaAs at high temperature for fully automated molecular beam epitaxy growth of Bragg mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ measurement is a key feature to better understand and precisely control the growth of complex structures, such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. In this work, we are showing the precise measurement of optical indices of AlGaAs at 600 {\textdegree}C over a wide spectral range (450--1400 nm). To do so, in-situ spectral reflectance measurement is used, combined with ex-situ layer thickness and composition measurement by x-ray diffraction enabling for precise determination of the optical indices with an accuracy better than 1%. To validate our measurements, we realized the complete automation of the growth of a GaAs/AlAs 940 nm-DBR by molecular beam epitaxy, without the need to pre-calibrate cells fluxes. The fabricated DBR shows a deviation of 0.2 nm of the stop-band central-wavelength compared to the targeted one. This approach holds significant interest for the III--V semiconductor community and epitaxial growth techniques.</description>

      <title>Defect-Limited Efficiency of Pnictogen Chalcohalide Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pnictogen chalcohalides (MChX) have recently emerged as promising nontoxic and environmentally friendly photovoltaic absorbers, combining strong light absorption coefficients with favorable low-temperature synthesis conditions. Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies.</description>

      <title>Eu-assisted enhancement of photoresponse in MBE-grown CdO/Si photodetectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping cadmium oxide with rare earth (RE) elements is a way to control the band gap and enhance carrier concentration and mobility. This work presents how one of REs, europium, impacts performance of CdO/Si diode. The samples were grown using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Doping level was modified by changing the temperature of the effusion cell with Eu and therefore flux of Eu particles. Different dopant concentrations were confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy images revealed a grain-like surface structure of the samples with grain size increasing after rapid thermal processing (RTP). Raman spectroscopy showed that introducing Eu changes vibrational properties of CdO through intraionic anharmonicity reduction. Kelvin probe method revealed upward band bending caused by oxygen adsorption during RTP. Electrical measurements confirmed that rectifying junctions were manufactured and that they are able to produce photocurrent in the spectral range of 450-1150 nm without external voltage bias. Introducing Eu into CdO was found to increase e.g. rectifying factor and responsivity. The results show that doping CdO with Eu is a way to enhance performance of the presented zero-power-consumption photodetectors, making it a promising material for future applications in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Origin of Bright Quantum Emissions with High Debye-Waller factor in Silicon Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride has emerged as a promising photonic platform for integrated single-photon sources, yet the microscopic origin of the recently observed bright quantum emissions remains unclear. Using hybrid density functional theory, we show that the negatively charged N$_\text{Si}$V$_\text{N}$ center (NV$^{-}$) in the C$_{1h}$ configuration exhibits a linearly polarized zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 2.46 eV, with a radiative lifetime of 9.01 ns and a high Debye-Waller (DW) factor of 33%. We further find that the C$_{1h}$ configuration is prone to a pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortion, yielding two symmetrically equivalent defect structures that emit bright, linearly polarized ZPL at 1.80 eV with a lifetime of 10.17 ns and an increased DW factor of 41%. These nitrogen-vacancy-related defects explain the origins of visible quantum emissions, paving the way for deterministic and monolithically integrated silicon-nitride quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization driven by non-collinear spin alignment investigated by first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for first principles investigations on the spin driven electric polarization in type II multiferroics. We propose a
  parametrization of the polarization with the parameters calculated
  using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) formalism. Within this approach the induced electric polarization of a unit cell is represented in terms of three-site parameters. Those antisymmetric with respect to spin permutation are seen as an ab-initio based counter-part to the phenomenological parameters used within the inverse-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction (DMI) model. Due to their relativistic origin, these parameters are responsible for the electric polarization induced in the presence of a non-collinear spin alignment in materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Beyond to this, our approach gives direct access to the element- or site-resolved electric polarization. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, we consider several examples of the so-called type II multiferroics, for which the magneto-electric effect is observed either as a consequence of an applied magnetic field (we use Cr$_2$O$_3$ as a prototype), or as a result of a phase transition to a spin-spiral magnetic state, as for instance in MnI$_2$, CuCrO$_2$ and AgCrO$_2$.</description>

      <title>First-principles screening of materials with extreme effective masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective mass of charge carriers is a fundamental descriptor of the electronic structure of materials, and can be used to assess performance in electronics applications, or to screen for thermoelectrics and transparent conductors. Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces.</description>

      <title>Distinguish the Orientation of Sliding Ferroelectricity by Second-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the emerging ferroelectric (FE) materials, the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics without phase-matching bottleneck, usually exhibit the pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \c{hi}xxx and \c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new "slidetronics" applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing the tribological stress field by using deformation twins as probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructural evolution in metallic materials feedbacks with the loading conditions and influences the life time of parts and components. Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale Origin of Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya Interaction in Pt/Fe/Au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results show remarkable interfacial--Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (i-DMI) in magnetic heterostructures composed of relatively thick Fe thin films ($\gg 1$ nm). To investigate its origin, we present a thorough magnetic characterization of the SiO$_2$/${}^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$($t$)/Au and SiO$_2$/Pt/${}^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$($t$)/Au heterostructures ($t = 1.6$ - $2.2$ nm). An i-DMI constant of $D_s^{\mathrm{Pt}} = 0.43\,\mathrm{mJ\,m^{-2}}$ is extracted for the Pt/Fe/Au system, as probed by wavevector-resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. Ferromagnetic resonance and conversion electron M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicate that significant surface anisotropy is present in Pt/Fe/Au, and that an interfacial Fe fraction ($\sim18$) exhibits tilted magnetization ($\sim25^\circ$ out of plane) and an enhanced hyperfine field, correlating with the stronger i-DMI.</description>

      <title>Reversible nanopore sealing and in situ iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis on thin silicon nitride membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report in-situ synthesis of iron oxide particles inside silicon nitride nanopores via a chemical reaction, monitored by current readout. Nanopores were formed by electroporation on glass chips (diameters from 1.7 to 11.3 nm), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) drilling (diameters from 6.5 to 64.6 nm), or hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching (diameters from 12.6 to 36.2 nm) in 5 to 20 nm thick membranes. Nanopores seal on timescales from ~1 ms to ~3.6 s, across a range of sizes and concentrations. We show single and ~5-pore arrays, as fabricated, after sealing, and after cleaning and pore recovery. These results are independent of fabrication method. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), aberration-corrected scanning TEM (AC-STEM), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) verify the synthesis of mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide. This work advances nanoparticle-nanopore chips for applications in biosensing, plasmonics and photonics when position and size control is required.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ Nanoscale Films as Spin Pumping Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising class of materials for spintronics, with the aim of promoting efficient spin-charge conversion (SCC) in TMD/ferromagnet (FM)-based devices. The MoTe$_2$ semimetal with distorted orthorhombic crystal structure in the 1T$'$ phase has gathered particular attention due to its high spin-orbit coupling and reconfigurability as a type-II Weyl semimetal close to room temperature. Here, we report on the role of chemically grown 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ thin films in inducing SCC in 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/FM heterostructures as measured at room temperature. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and electrically detected spin-pumping FMR measurements performed on 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Co/Au and 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Au/Co/Au heterostructures reveal a spin-mixing conductance value of up to $\sim1.6 \times 10^{20}~\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and a spin Hall angle of $1.7\%$. These findings position MoTe$_2$ thin films as a competitive spin-charge conversion option compared to other functional materials (e.g., heavy metals, topological insulators), highlighting their potential for future applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>On-chip high-order parametric downconversion in the excitonic Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ for programmable multiphoton entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\chi^{(2)}$--$\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\chi^{(3)}$ and $\chi^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>First-principles band alignment engineering in polar and nonpolar orientations for wurtzite AlN, GaN, and B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron aluminum nitride (B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N) is a promising material for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its ultra-wide bandgap, high thermal stability, and compatibility with other III-nitride semiconductors. Despite its potential, the band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N remain largely unexplored, although this information is essential for device design. In this study, we compute the valence and conduction band alignments of nonpolar ($a$-plane) and polar ($c$-plane) B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, and compare them with those of AlN and GaN. Using density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, $GW_0$ method, and a novel passivation scheme, we find that they have near-zero valence band alignments for low-$x$ B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN, while higher compositions ($x &gt; $0.333) exhibit type I or II band alignments. The band alignments also show a notable dependence on surface polarity and the tetrahedral distortion of the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures. Our computed offsets are in good agreement with available experimental data. Due to their low valence band alignments and higher conduction band alignments, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN heterostructures could be well suited for high-electron-mobility transistors and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes. The band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N determined in this study provide essential design guidelines for integrating these ultra-wide bandgap alloys into advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

      <title>Local chemical order suppresses grain boundary migration under irradiation in CrCoNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex concentrated alloys with intrinsic chemical heterogeneity are promising candidates for nuclear applications, where local chemical order can strongly influence defect evolution under irradiation. Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It makes sense to consider a helical waveguide with a fine pitch approximately, replacing the turns with anisotropic conductivity: infinite along the turns and zero across them. This approach has been known for a long time, but calculation formulas within it have only been obtained for the case where the winding does not contain a dielectric core. This paper addresses this gap in the theory: calculation formulas are obtained for the case where the waveguide contains a dielectric with a certain permittivity and magnetic permeability. An equation determining the slowing factor is found, and a method for its numerical solution is proposed. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wave impedance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the apparent violation of the Mott relation in a noncentrosymmetric kagome ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In magnetic topological materials, time-reversal symmetry breaking gives rise to topological point and line nodes with distinctive signatures in the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivity that satisfy the well-known Mott relation. However, this relationship can fail for doping-dependent transport measurements of materials with complex magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations. In this work, we present transport measurements of the correlated topological metal UCoAl doped with Ru, which appear to violate the Mott relation. We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level.</description>

      <title>Magnetosynthesis effect on the structure and ground state of Cu$^{2+}$-based antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subtle synthetic variables can have an outsizes influence on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a material, particularly those of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of synthesis under a magnetic field (magnetosynthesis) on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of several Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) based materials with antiferromagnetic interactions and varying levels of magnetic frustration, from simple antiferromagnets to a quantum spin liquid. We employ small (0.09 - 0.37 T) magnetic fields applied during low-temperature hydrothermal or evaporative synthesis of the simple antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the frustrated and canted antiferromagnet atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, and the highly frustrated quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We found that (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O experiences structural changes well above its magnetic transition. Atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl synthesized under a 0.19 T field experiences a 0.15 K (~3%) decrease in its N\'eel transition temperature and a significant strengthening of its antiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.</description>

      <title>New record in optical gain and room-temperature nanolasers in multiple wavelengths in 2D ErOCl single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erbium-based materials have long been recognized for their important telecom-band applications, yet their widespread adoption in integrated optoelectronics has been hindered by two fundamental limitations: the difficulty in achieving high erbium density without concentration quenching which leads to small optical gain in doped materials, and the difficulty in fabricating a practical device with single crystal nanowires that demonstrated high optical gain previously1,2. Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 {\mu}W with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric -- which quantifies the distance between quantum states -- is a fundamental component of the quantum geometric tensor, playing a crucial role in a wide range of physical phenomena. Its direct detection and control remains a challenge, requiring suitable material candidates. In this work, we present the emergence of a tunable quantum metric in a versatile two-dimensional material platform, namely, few-layer phosphorene. Using ab-initio-derived models, we show how electric fields can be used to substantially enhance the quantum metric as well as the associated quantum weight. Furthermore, we present a layer-dependent evolution of the quantum metric and its interplay with the electric field in this material. Our results establish few-layer phosphorene as a promising platform for exploring control over the quantum metric and the resulting metric responses in real materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) has been leveraged as a crucial functional layer in the optoelectronic frameworks, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 {\deg}C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice.</description>

      <title>QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities. Dataset and model implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/QuantumCanvas.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Curation and Expansion of Metal-Organic Frameworks Database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) databases have grown rapidly through experimental deposition and large-scale literature extraction, but recent analyses show that nearly half of their entries contain substantial structural errors. These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of permanent laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on solid surfaces under impulsive laser irradiation above the damage threshold has been subject of extensive research. We demonstrate the formation of transient surface displacement patterns under femtosecond laser irradiation at fluences well below this threshold. Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations. We suggest that our experiment revealed a universal phenomenon that will be observed on any strongly absorbing material under ultrafast laser irradiation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Mofasa: A Step Change in Metal-Organic Framework Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mofasa is an all-atom latent diffusion model with state-of-the-art performance for generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
  In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.
  To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: https://mofux.ai/ .</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</description>

Abstract: The integrated device of a perovskite solar cell with a Li-ion battery is an innovative solution for decentralized energy storage in smart electronic devices. In this study, we examine the stability of Li ions intercalated in a CsPbI$_3$ perovskite and their effect on the electronic structure of Li$_x$CsPbI$_3$ compounds using first-principles density functional theory. Our simulations demonstrate that the insertion of Li at concentrations up to $x$ = 1 into CsPbI$_3$ is energetically possible. Moreover, we identify that the distortion of the Pb-I octahedra has the strongest impact on the change in the electronic band gap. Specifically, an increase in the amount of intercalated Li causes larger structural distortions, which in turn lead to an increasing band gap as function of the Li content.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of spin Hall angle by an order of magnitude via Cu intercalation in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel class of quantum materials with significant potential in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics, and opto-valleytronics. TMDs exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling, enabling efficient spin-charge interconversion, which makes them ideal candidates for spin-orbit torque-driven spintronic devices. In this study, we investigated the spin-to-charge conversion through ferromagnetic resonance in MoS$_2$/Cu/CoFeB heterostructures with varying Cu spacer thicknesses. The conversion efficiency, quantified by the spin Hall angle, was enhanced by an order of magnitude due to Cu intercalation. Magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy confirmed that Cu did not significantly modify the magnetic domains, indicating its effectiveness in decoupling MoS$_2$ from CoFeB. This decoupling preserves the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS$_2$ by mitigating the exchange interaction with CoFeB, as proximity to localized magnetization can alter the electronic structure and SOC. First-principles calculations revealed that Cu intercalation notably enhances the spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity, contributing to the increased spin Hall angle. This study demonstrates that interface engineering of ferromagnet/TMD-based heterostructures can achieve higher spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies, paving the way for advancements in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties and the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase of bulk CaTiO$_3$ from second principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A second-principles effective interatomic potential is introduced for the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at 0 K. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Origin of Quantum-Metric Effects via Momentum-Space Metric Tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of magnetization temperature dependence in ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnets, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T &lt;&lt; T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.</description>

      <title>Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.</description>

      <title>Limitations on Activation of High Dose Ge implant in beta-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, beta-Ga2O3 is particularly promising for high power and frequency applications. For devices, n-type concentrations above 10^19 cm^-3 are required. Ge is a promising alternative n-type dopant with an ionic radius similar to Ga. Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge "clustering peak" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to &gt;200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering. Ultimately, we believe Ge clustering limits activation of implanted Ge at high concentrations.</description>

Abstract: Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $\alpha$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>

Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau theory of spin pumping through an antiferromagnetic layer near the N\'{e}el temperature</title>

Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>

Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Sliding of cylindrical shell into a rigid hole</title>

Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.</description>
