      <title>Assessing high-order effects in feature importance via predictability decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the large body of work devoted in recent years to describe redundancy and synergy in multivariate interactions among random variables, we propose a novel approach to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance, one of the most used techniques for explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, we propose an adaptive version of a well-known metric of feature importance, named Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO), to disentangle high-order effects involving a given input feature in regression problems. LOCO is the reduction of the prediction error when the feature under consideration is added to the set of all the features used for regression. Instead of calculating the LOCO using all the features at hand, as in its standard version, our method searches for the multiplet of features that maximize LOCO and for the one that minimize it. This provides a decomposition of the LOCO as the sum of a two-body component and higher-order components (redundant and synergistic), also highlighting the features that contribute to building these high-order effects alongside the driving feature. We report the application to proton/pion discrimination from simulated detector measures by GEANT.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in Interbank Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted reciprocity between two agents can be defined as the minimum of sending and receiving value in their bilateral relationship. In financial networks, such reciprocity characterizes the importance of individual banks as both liquidity absorber and provider, a feature typically attributed to large, intermediating dealer banks. In this paper we develop an exponential random graph model that can account for reciprocal links of each node simultaneously on the topological as well as on the weighted level. We provide an exact expression for the normalizing constant and thus a closed-form solution for the graph probability distribution. Applying this statistical null model to Italian interbank data, we find that before the great financial crisis (i) banks displayed significantly more weighted reciprocity compared to what the lower-order network features (size and volume distributions) would predict (ii) with a disappearance of this deviation once the early periods of the crisis set in, (iii) a trend which can be attributed in particular to smaller banks (dis)engaging in bilateral high-value trading relationships. Moreover, we show that neglecting reciprocal links and weights can lead to spurious findings of triadic relationships. As the hierarchical structure in the network is found to be compatible with its transitive but not with its intransitive triadic sub-graphs, the interbank market seems to be well-characterized by a hierarchical core-periphery structure enhanced by non-hierarchical reciprocal trading relationships.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. {In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on an infinitely long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we set up a theoretical framework of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our framework can identify whether the sufficient statistics are enough for empirical estimation of all unknown parameters and we can also provide a quantitative criterion that reveals nonequilibrium. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is capable of detecting a larger nonequilibrium region compared to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Minimum Reduced-Order Models via Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing sparse, effective reduced-order models (ROMs) for high-dimensional dynamical data is an active area of research in applied sciences. In this work, we study an efficient approach to identifying such sparse ROMs using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. Given a feature library of possible building block terms for the sought ROMs, the causation entropy ranks the importance of each term to the dynamics conveyed by the training data before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. It thus allows for an efficient construction of a hierarchy of ROMs with varying degrees of sparsity to effectively handle different tasks. This article examines the ability of the causation entropy to identify skillful sparse ROMs when a relatively high-dimensional ROM is required to emulate the dynamics conveyed by the training dataset. We demonstrate that a Gaussian approximation of the causation entropy still performs exceptionally well even in presence of highly non-Gaussian statistics. Such approximations provide an efficient way to access the otherwise hard to compute causation entropies when the selected feature library contains a large number of candidate functions. Besides recovering long-term statistics, we also demonstrate good performance of the obtained ROMs in recovering unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations, a test that has not been done before for causation-based ROMs of partial differential equations. The paradigmatic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation placed in a chaotic regime with highly skewed, multimodal statistics is utilized for these purposes.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>
