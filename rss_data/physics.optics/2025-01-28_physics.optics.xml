      <title>High-Performance, Efficient, Low-Fresnel Number Focusing Metamirror in the D-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface-based optical components are becoming increasingly important due to their unparalleled ability to shape and manipulate electromagnetic waves across a wide range of frequencies, from microwave and terahertz to visible light. In particular, planar meta-mirrors with high efficiency and broad operational bandwidth are expected to play a significant role in shaping channel characteristics for 6G communication links due to their reduced SWaP (size, weight, and power) and integrability. However, achieving large fractional bandwidth and high efficiency simultaneously using metasurface-based mirrors or reflectors have been challenging. In this work, highly efficient broadband focusing meta-mirror has been designed, fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. The device operates in the D-Band (110-170 GHz) and beyond (up to 200 GHz), and exhibits unmatched performance in terms of combined fractional bandwidth (58\%) and energy efficiency, exceeding 53\% over the entire bandwidth with a peak of 77.4\% at frequency 135 GHz. The high performance and advantageous design tradeoffs of this meta-mirror are discussed in terms of the principles of low Fresnel number optics.</description>

      <title>Integrated 3D printing of transparency-on-demand glass microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass is essential in optics and photonics due to its exceptional optical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Additive manufacturing has emerged as a novel method for fabricating complex glass elements in recent years, yet achieving locally controlled transparency in glass micro-objects remains a significant challenge. We present an innovative method, termed Transparency-on-Demand Glass Additive Manufacturing (TGAM), to control the transparency of 3D printed glass elements using polymeric silsesquioxane (PSQ) and two-photon polymerization (TPP). By precisely manipulating key parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, part thickness, and pyrolysis heating rate, we achieve the desired transparency levels. Our study reveals that monomer conversion during printing, structure thickness, and pyrolysis heating strategy significantly influence PSQ oxidation, resulting in varying transparency in the final glass product. This method enables the creation of high-precision, variable-transparency glass micro-components, providing a scalable and efficient solution for producing complex glass structures with tailored optical transparency. Our technique paves the way for integrated manufacturing of controllable-transparency glass micro-structures, unlocking new possibilities for advanced optical and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free widely tunable external cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision applications such as quantum computing, quantum and fiber sensing, and mmWave and RF generation, require ultra-low phase noise stabilized lasers operating at wavelengths across the visible to near-IR. These applications employ widely tunable table-scale laser systems, bulk-optic reference cavities, and optical isolation to achieve ultra-low frequency noise and high stability across wide wavelength ranges. Photonic integration promises to bring these laser systems to the chip-scale, enabling reliable, scalable and portable precision applications. Here we report record-low integrated laser linewidths with a coil-cavity stabilized 1550 nm tunable laser, that achieves 3 to 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidths with an Allan deviation of 1.8E-13 at 6.4 ms across 40 nm. These results represent 5 orders of magnitude noise reduction and almost 2-orders magnitude reduction in integral linewidth for widely tunable integrated lasers. The hybrid integrated silicon nitride external cavity tunable laser is stabilized to a silicon nitride 10-meter long integrated coil-resonator without the need for an optical isolator by leveraging the inherent 45 dB isolation. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same 80 nm-thick ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide CMOS foundry compatible process, which combined with the inherent isolation, unlocks the path towards fully integrated visible to NIR frequency-stabilized lasers.</description>

      <title>Image formation theory of optical coherence tomography with optical aberrations and its application for computational aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational correction of defocus and aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising approach to achieve high-resolution imaging with deep imaging depth without hardware costs. However, the techniques are not well understood due to the lack of an accurate theoretical model and investigation tools. The image formation theory of optical coherence tomography (OCT) with optical aberrations is formulated. Based on the theory, a numerical simulation method is developed and computational refocusing (CR) and aberration correction (CAC) methods are designed. The newly designed CAC method is applied to the OCT images of a microparticle phantom and in vivo human retina. The results show that the CAC method can correct the optical aberrations and improve the image quality. The theoretical model-based approach is a powerful tool for understanding the OCT imaging properties and designing new processing methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field induced control and Multiple Magnomechanically Induced Transparency in Single Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) in a microwave 3D copper cavity with two YIG spheres under varying interaction parameters. Numerical simulations show that the steady-state magnon number increases with stronger coupling between cavity photons and magnons, and is sensitive to both bias and drive magnetic fields. Pronounced peaks in the magnon population near resonant fields highlight the importance of the bias field in energy transfer. The transparency windows are tunable, with up to quadruple windows depending on the coupling and magnon-phonon interactions, as seen in the transmission spectrum. Dispersion analysis reveals normal and anomalous regions, enabling slow and fast light propagation modulated by coupling strength. Phase and group delay variations, influenced by the drive field, further validate the tunability of transparency windows. This study demonstrates the potential of MMIT for precise control with out any additional non-linearity over light-matter interactions, with applications in quantum information processing and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Topological photonic crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal fibres (PCFs) are optical fibres that guide light using a modulated dielectric medium. They provide an exceptionally versatile platform for various applications, thanks to the flexibility with which light-guiding can be customised by modifying the fibre geometry. Here, we realise a PCF with guided modes produced by photonic bandstructure topology rather than conventional mode-trapping mechanisms. The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localiser that makes minimal assumptions about the bandstructure. Our experiments on the fabricated topological fibre show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10--20 dB/km, which do not increase much when the fibre is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses. Optical fibres based on topological modes thus hold promise for improved performance and novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Mode-locking in a semiconductor photonic bandgap laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode lasers have a very complex dynamics, as expected when oscillators are nonlinearly coupled. Order emerges when the modes lock together; in this case the coherent superposition of the modes results into a periodic train of pulses or a nearly constant power output with a linearly chirped frequency, for instance. The first is promoted by a saturable absorber, or an equivalent physical mechanism, while the latter is connected to more subtle conditions, such as the fast dynamics of the gain. Here we consider the case of a multimode semiconductor laser with gain provided by quantum wells but without any saturable absorber. The cavity is designed to have a photonic bandgap and very low dispersion. We show, first in theory, that modes can lock together and generate a variety of waveforms which are not trains of pulses nor chirped continuous power waves. Mode locking is observed in experiments on a III-V/Silicon hybrid laser with the cavity made of a suitably tapered grating. Moreover, we find that the mode-locking beatnote is strongly dependent on the injected current: we reach more than 1 GHz modulation amplitude of the beatnote at a modulation frequency of 50 kHz. The behaviour of the laser is critically determined by the dispersion, which can be controlled by the photonic crystal structure. By scaling up the number of interacting modes, this laser source may offer an effective and extremely flexible way of generating waveforms \`a la carte.</description>

      <title>Sensitive bioassay with an ultra-large dynamic range via microlaser ensemble quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bioassay platform that leverages the lasing threshold distribution in a microlaser ensemble (ME), consisting of hundreds of individual microlasers, to measure analyte concentrations in solution. An ME is formed by placing dye-doped microbeads in a micro Fabry-Perot cavity. Microbeads are surface modified with biorecognition molecules to capture analytes, while the quenchers resulting from the presence of the analytes on the microbeads' surfaces increase the lasing thresholds of microlasers. Since the number of analytes varies from one microbead (or microlaser) to another due to the randomness in binding processes, a distribution of the analytes (and hence the quenchers) in the ME is created, which in turn leads to a lasing threshold distribution in the ME. Experimentally, multiple pumping energy densities are used to probe the lasing threshold distribution. A theoretical model is developed to map the lasing threshold distribution to analyte distribution in the ME, and then to recover the analyte concentration in solution. Using streptavidin and interleukin-6 as a model system, our platform achieves a detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL and a dynamic range exceeding five orders of magnitude, showing that the ME quenching method can provide a high sensitivity with a superior dynamic range.</description>

      <title>On-chip real-time detection of optical frequency variations with ultrahigh resolution using the sine-cosine encoder approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time measurement of optical frequency variations (OFVs) is crucial for various applications including laser frequency control, optical computing, and optical sensing. Traditional devices, though accurate, are often too large, slow and costly. Here we present a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) chip, utilizing the sine-cosine encoder principle, for high-speed and high-resolution real-time OFV measurement. Fabricated on a thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, this chip-sized optical frequency detector (OFD) (5.5 mm * 2.7 mm) achieves a speed of up to 2500 THz/s and a resolution as fine as 2 MHz over a range exceeding 160 nm. Our robust algorithm overcomes the device imperfections and ensures precise quantification of OFV parameters. As a practical demonstration, the PIC OFD surpasses existing fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogators in sensitivity and speed for strain and vibration measurements. This work opens new avenues for on-chip OFV detection and offers significant potential for diverse applications involving OFV measurement.</description>

      <title>Two-optical-cycle pulses from nanophotonic two-color soliton compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few- and single-cycle optical pulses and their associated ultra-broadband spectra have been crucial in the progress of ultrafast science and technology. Multi-color waveforms composed of independently manipulable ultrashort pulses in distinct spectral bands offer unique advantages in pulse synthesis and high harmonic generation. However, the generation and control of ultrashort pulses has required bulky optical systems at the tabletop scale. Quadratic soliton compression theoretically offers a direct route to generation of few-cycle, two-color pulses but is fundamentally limited in bulk systems by the unavoidable presence of walk-off between the fundamental and second harmonic waves. Here, we show that the dispersion engineering capabilities of nanophotonics allow these limitations to be overcome, enabling extreme simultaneous pulse compression of the fundamental and second harmonic components and control over the resultant pulse shape. We experimentally demonstrate quadratic soliton pulse compression in dispersion-engineered nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides and achieve two-optical-cycle pulses requiring pJ pump pulse energies. We further illustrate how the demonstrated compression scheme can be readily extended to on-chip single-cycle pulse synthesis. When integrated with femtosecond and picosecond sources in lithium niobate, our results provide a path towards realization of single-cycle ultrafast systems in nanophotonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Fiber Endoscopy Using Synthetic Wavelengths for 3D tissue imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-based endoscopes utilizing multi-core fiber (MCF) bundles offer the capability to image deep within the human body, making them well-suited for imaging applications in minimally invasive surgery or diagnosis. However, the optical fields relayed through each fiber core can be significantly affected by phase scrambling from height irregularities at the fiber ends or potential multi-mode cores. Moreover, obtaining high-quality endoscopic images commonly requires the fiber tip to be placed close to the target or relies on the addition of a lens. Additionally, imaging through scattering layers after the fiber tip is commonly not possible. In this work, we address these challenges by integrating Synthetic Wavelength Imaging (SWI) with fiber endoscopy. This novel approach enables the endoscopic acquisition of holographic information from objects obscured by scattering layers. The resulting endoscopic system eliminates the need for lenses and is inherently robust against phase scrambling caused by scattering and fiber bending. Using this technique, we successfully demonstrate the endoscopic imaging of features approximately 750micrometers in size on an object positioned behind a scattering layer. This advancement represents significant potential for enabling spatially resolved three-dimensional imaging of objects concealed beneath tissue using fiber endoscopes, expanding the capabilities of these systems for medical applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic Approach to Arbitrary Transformation of Multiple Polarization States Using Waveplates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic method for transforming states of polarization (SoPs) into any arbitrary target SoPs, whether linear or elliptical, by determining the precise waveplate rotation angles required for the transformation. Unlike the method based on TRIAD algorithm, which is restricted to specific target SoPs, this study generalizes the approach to enable transformations to arbitrary target states. By representing these transformations as rigid body rotations in Stokes space and computing the corresponding Mueller matrices, we establish a robust framework for accurate and versatile polarization control.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Emitter-Coupled Meta-Optics for Versatile Photon Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the spontaneous emission of nanoscale quantum emitters (QEs) is crucial for developing advanced photon sources required in many areas of modern nanophotonics, including quantum information technologies. Conventional approaches to shaping photon emission are based on using bulky configurations, while approaches recently developed in quantum metaphotonics suffer from limited capabilities in achieving desired polarization states and directionality, failing to provide on-demand photon sources tailored precisely to technological needs. Here, we propose a universal approach to designing versatile photon sources using on-chip QE-coupled meta-optics that enable direct transformations of QE-excited surface plasmon polaritons into spatially propagating photon streams with arbitrary polarization states, directionality, and amplitudes via both resonance and geometric phases supplied by meta-atoms. Leveraging this platform, we experimentally demonstrate the independent engineering of polarization states, directionality, and relative amplitudes of photon emission in single and multiple radiation channels. The developed universal approach represents a major step towards the realization of versatile quantum sources, highlighting the potential of integrated photon sources with superior properties for both classical and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Flexible delivery of broadband, 100-fs mid-infrared pulses in the water-absorption band using hollow-core photonic crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality free-space and over-fibre transmission of mid-IR light is limited by factors such as material-related absorption, diffraction, light leakage and nonlinearity. Conventional vacuum apparatus can be utilized for high-quality laser-beam delivery to address these issues, the deployment of such apparatus would, however, increase the system complexity, being detrimental to their practical applications. Here we report the successful use of evacuated hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (PCF) to flexibly transmit ultrafast mid-IR pulses over several meters, while preserving exceptional spatial, spectral and temporal fidelity. The PCF was engineered to feature a low-loss transmission band within the water absorption range, and an evacuated 5-m length was used to transmit Watt-level, 100 fs pulses centred at around 2.8 microns. A comparison between free-space transmission and air-filled PCF highlights the superior performance of the evacuated hollow-core PCF, indicating its strong suitability for the flexible delivery of sub-ps laser pulses in the mid-IR.</description>

      <title>Confocal Ellipsoidal Reflectors with Phased Array Vivaldi Antenna Source for Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an on-axis dual-reflector confocal ellipsoidal structure is presented for near-field imaging systems. In the proposed structure, the backscattered electromagnetic wave problem, known as the blockage effect, is reduced considerably using an elaborate design of the sub-reflector and precise alignment of the reflectors. The proposed geometry is analyzed, followed by a design example for the stand-off distance of 2 m. The blockage reduction characteristic is verified using ray-tracing simulation. Next, the scanning performance of the structure is investigated utilizing a Vivaldi phased array antenna as the source designed at the central frequency of 28 GHz. The full-wave simulations proved a field-of-view (FoV) of approximately 40 cm. Furthermore, tuning the proposed reflectors configuration standoff distance is examined with a point source. The ray-tracing simulations showed that stand-off distance can be easily changed up to tens of centimeters with just a few centimeters of source point lateral displacement.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in nonlinear and linear Quantum Optics: the Kerr-like and multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to analyze a rather vast counter-rotating Hamiltonian interaction in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The method relies upon the supersymmetric mapping of the corresponding rotating interaction and allows the analysis of the dynamics in the counter-rotating system in a fully general and exact analytical manner. Intriguing features of the counter-rotating system are revealed through the simple supersymmetric transformation. In turn, such interesting attributes have an important range of potential technological applications. In this way, supersymmetry emerges as a useful tool to both connect and construct exactly solvable photonic systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and more generally in quantum optics, as well as to analyze the corresponding physical consequences and their possible technology implementations.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with Structured Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, an effective two-photon interference phenomenon, is a cornerstone of quantum optics and a key tool for linear optical quantum information processing. While the HOM effect has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally for various photonic quantum states, particularly in the spectral domain, detailed overviews of its behaviour for structured photons -- those with complex spatial profiles -- under arbitrary spatial mode measurement schemes are still lacking. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the HOM effect for structured photons, including an arbitrary mode projection on quantum interference outcomes. The tutorial also provides analytical, closed-form expressions of the HOM visibility under different measurement conditions, which is a crucial contribution for its application in computational and artificial-intelligence-driven discovery of new quantum experiments exploiting the power of photons with complex spatial modes.</description>

      <title>Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</description>

      <title>Accurate THz Measurements of Permittivity and Permeability of BiFeO$_3$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrodynamic properties of BiFeO$_3$ films in the THz region are investigated via time domain spectroscopy. Combining the use of transmission ($\tilde{T}$) and reflection ($\tilde{R}$) measurements under normal incidence, the refractive index and impedance of the samples under test are evaluated using a retrieval method. From $\tilde{T}$(($\tilde{R}$)) data two complex functions describing the refractive index $\tilde{n}_T$ ($\tilde{n}_R$) and impedance $\tilde{z}_T$ ($\tilde{z}_R$) are extracted from the independent minimization of the error functions given by the difference between the theoretical model and measurements. Knowledge of the pairs ($\tilde{n}_T, \tilde{n}_R$) and ($\tilde{z}_T, \tilde{z}_R$) enables to calculate with a high accuracy both complex permittivity $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ and permeability $\tilde{\mu}$ of the sample. Signatures of magnetoelectric effects and phononic resonances are observed in the permittivity and permeability functions and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale resolved mapping of the dipole emission of hBN color centers with a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as quantum light sources for future technologies. In this work, we utilize a scattering-type near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) to study the photoluminescence (PL) emission characteristics of such quantum emitters in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy grown hBN. On the one hand, we demonstrate direct near-field optical excitation and emission through interaction with the nanofocus of the tip resulting in a sub-diffraction limited tip-enhanced PL hotspot. On the other hand, we show that indirect excitation and emission via scattering from the tip significantly increases the recorded PL intensity. This demonstrates that the tip-assisted PL (TAPL) process efficiently guides the generated light to the detector. We apply the TAPL method to map the in-plane dipole orientations of the hBN color centers on the nanoscale. This work promotes the widely available s-SNOM approach to applications in the quantum domain including characterization and optical control.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</description>

Abstract: Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs quantum dot light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895\,nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7)\,GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3)\,ns at an internal efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{int}=0.6(1)\%$. Our results significantly expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor quantum dots in future quantum network architectures.</description>

      <title>Single-shot capable surface acoustic wave dispersion measurement of a layered plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Established techniques for characterizing a layer on a substrate system via surface acoustic wave (SAW) dispersion measurement are often slow due to the need for scanning excitation or detection positions. We present a method for determining discrete points on the SAW mode at equidistant wavenumbers that requires only a single measurement, overcoming these speed limitations. A pulsed laser, shaped into an array of equidistant lines, generates elastic waves on the sample surface. A vibrometer detects the resulting surface displacement next to the line array. The periodic excitation arrangement results in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to integer fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the response spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW. The known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak frequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve, effectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an inverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain properties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad epoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results with dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the method's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach offers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly in scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is acceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Doppler laser spectroscopy is a crucial technique for laser frequency stabilization, playing a significant role in atomic physics, precision measurement, and quantum communication. However, recent efforts to improve frequency stability appear to have reached a bottleneck, as they primarily focus on external technical approaches while neglecting the fundamental issue of low atomic utilization (&lt; 1%), caused by only near-zero transverse velocity atoms involved in the transition. Here, we propose a velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) solution that takes advantage of the velocity-selective resonance effect of multi-frequency comb lasers to enhance the utilization of non-zero-velocity atoms. In the probe-pump configuration, each pair of counter-propagating lasers interacts with atoms from different transverse velocity-comb groups, independently contributing to the spectral amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary proof-of-principle results show that the frequency stability of the triple-frequency laser is optimized by nearly a factor of \sqrt{3} compared to the single-frequency laser, consistent with theoretical expectations. With more frequency comb components, MTS-stabilized lasers are expected to achieve order-of-magnitude breakthroughs in frequency stability, taking an important step toward next-generation compact optical clocks. This unique method can also be widely applied to any quantum system with a wide velocity distribution, inspiring innovative advances in numerous fields with a fresh perspective.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz.
  Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers.

      <title>Complex Poynting vector in gyromagnetic media and its impact on power flow in guided modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the relation between the time-varying spinning nature of the instantaneous Poynting vector and the phasor form of the complex Poynting vector in the bulk of the gyromagnetic medium. We show the presence of a transverse reactive power component in the bulk of the gyrotropic medium, even for plane wave propagation. We use a simple quantification technique of Poynting vector spin to analyze the rotation of the instantaneous Poynting vector using the complex phasor form of the time-averaged Poynting vector. For a transverse electric mode, we show the similarity between the Poynting vector spin and the photonic spin of the magnetic field. The Poynting vector spin is then used to represent the transverse power transfer across a ferrite-air interface supporting TE surface wave modes. Considering a gyromagnetic ferrite-filled rectangular waveguide following the TE mode profile, we show the correspondence between the Poynting vector spin and the overall positive and backward power flow. We analytically propose a mechanism to engineer the region of the waveguide supporting backward and forward power propagation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously Integrated Memristive Laser on Silicon with Non-Volatile Wavelength Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The von-Neumann bottleneck has constrained computing systems from efficiently operating on the increasingly large demand in data from networks and devices. Silicon (Si) photonics offers a powerful solution for this issue by providing a platform for high-bandwidth, energy-efficient interconnects. Furthermore, memristors have emerged as a fundamental building block for non-volatile data storage and novel computing architectures with powerful in-memory processing capabilities. In this paper, we integrate an Al2O3 memristor into a heterogeneous Si quantum dot microring laser to demonstrate the first laser with non-volatile optical memory. The memristor alters the effective optical modal index of the microring laser cavity by the plasma dispersion effect in the high resistance state (HRS) or Joule heating in the low resistance state (LRS), subsequently controlling the output wavelength of the laser in a non-volatile manner. This device enables a novel pathway for future optoelectronic neuromorphic computers and optical memory chips.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization Algorithm for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High degree of adjustability enables the holographic tweezer array a versatile platform for creating an arbitrary geometrical atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiments, an optical tweezer generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as a static tweezer array. However, the alternating current (AC) stark effect generally induces the intensity difference of traps in terms of different light shifts. So, intensity equalization is an essential prerequisite for preparing a many-body system with individually controlled atoms. Here, we report an intensity equalization algorithm. In particular, we observe the non-uniformity of the tweezer array is below 1.1% when the array size is larger than 1000. Our analysis shows that by optimizing the hardware performance of the optical system, this uniformity could be further improved. Our work offers the opportunities for large-scale quantum computation and simulation with reconfigurable atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally report on the detection of chaos from a free-running commercial broad-area VCSEL without the need for external perturbation such as optical feedback, injection or current modulation. The evolution of nonlinear dynamics leading to chaotic behavior is studied, and the system's complexity is characterized using chaos titration and correlation dimension. We link the occurence of chaos with the complex interplay between the spatial laser modes competition and polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sub-quadratic scalable approximate linear converter using multi-plane light conversion with low-entropy mode mixers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing is emerging as a promising platform for energy-efficient, high-throughput hardware in deep learning. A key challenge lies in the realization of optical matrix-vector multiplication, which often requires $O(N^2)$ phase shifters for exact synthesis of $N \times N$ matrices, limiting scalability. In this study, we propose an approximate matrix realization method using multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) that reduces both the system size and the number of phase shifters while maintaining acceptable error bounds. This approach uses low-entropy mode mixers, allowing more compact implementations compared to conventional mixers. We introduce Shannon matrix entropy as a measure of mode coupling strength in mixers and demonstrate that low-entropy mixers can preserve computational accuracy while reducing the requirements for the mixers. The approximation quality is evaluated using the maximum norm between the target and realized matrices. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves sub-quadratic scaling of phase shifters by tolerating predefined error thresholds. To identify efficient architectures for implementing general linear matrices, we compare block-encoding (BE) and singular-value decomposition (SVD) schemes for realizing general linear matrices using unitary converters based on MPLC. Results indicate that BE exhibits superior iterative configuration properties beyond the unitary group. By characterizing the trade-offs between matrix entropy, number of phase shifter layers, and the error tolerance, this study provides a framework for designing scalable and efficient approximate optical converters.</description>

      <title>Detectorless 3D terahertz imaging: achieving subwavelength resolution with reflectance confocal interferometric microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging holds great potential for non-destructive material inspection, but practical implementation has been limited by resolution constraints. In this study, we present a single-pixel THz imaging system based on a confocal microscope architecture, utilising a quantum cascade laser as both transmitter and phase-sensitive receiver. Our approach integrates laser feedback interferometry detection to achieve a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution and a two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in axial resolution over conventional imaging through precise interferometric phase measurements. This translates to a lateral resolution near $\lambda/2$ and a depth of focus better than $\lambda/5$, significantly outperforming traditional confocal systems. The system can produce a 0.5 Mpixel image in under two minutes, surpassing both raster-scanning single-pixel and multipixel focal-plane array-based imagers. Coherent operation enables simultaneous amplitude and phase image acquisition, and a custom visualisation method links amplitude to image saturation and phase to hue, enhancing material characterisation. A 3D tomographic analysis of a silicon chip reveals subwavelength features, demonstrating the system's potential for high-resolution THz imaging and material analysis. This work sets a new benchmark for THz imaging, overcoming key challenges and opening up transformative possibilities for non-destructive material inspection and characterisation.</description>

      <title>All-optical computing with beyond 100-GHz clock rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computer's clock rate ultimately determines the minimum time between sequential operations or instructions. Despite exponential advances in electronic computer performance owing to Moore's Law and increasingly parallel system architectures, computer clock rates have remained stagnant at $\sim5~\mathrm{GHz}$ for almost two decades. This poses an intractable problem for applications requiring real-time processing or control of ultrafast information systems. Here we break this barrier by proposing and experimentally demonstrating computing based on an end-to-end and all-optical recurrent neural network harnessing the ultrafast nature of linear and nonlinear optical operations while avoiding electronic operations. The all-optical computer realizes linear operations, nonlinear functions, and memory entirely in the optical domain with $&gt;100~\mathrm{GHz}$ clock rates. We experimentally demonstrate a prototypical task of noisy waveform classification as well as perform ultrafast in-situ analysis of the soliton states from integrated optical microresonators. We further illustrate the application of the architecture for generative artificial intelligence based on quantum fluctuations to generate images even in the absence of input optical signals. Our results highlight the potential of all-optical computing beyond what can be achieved with digital electronics by utilizing ultrafast linear, nonlinear, and memory functions and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion with an integrated soft-ferroelectric barium titanate transducer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Scanning diffraction imaging without stable illumination and scan position information</title>

Abstract: Ptychography has become prominent at synchrotron facilities worldwide for characterizing biological and material specimens' topological structures and properties at the nanometer or atomic scale, due to its lens - less, highly quantitative phase imaging. Its high - resolution imaging depends on accurate lateral scan position info, a large overlap ratio, and a stable probe function. But as research moves to atomic scales, meeting these requirements gets harder, often needing high - precision motion control and manual pre - calibration. This paper presents a new imaging framework. By adding a wavefront modulator and a new phase retrieval workflow, it removes the strict requirements of traditional ptychography. Significantly, our method doesn't need pre - calibration of the wavefront modulator. Optical validation showed the deviation between the recovered position and a top - tier motion stage was less than 10 nm. Sub - pixel position accuracy was achievable even with a 13% overlap ratio. In an X - ray experiment with a spatially unstable probe violating the ptychographic model and an 18% overlap ratio, our method simultaneously and quantitatively retrieved beam spatial deviation, scan position, probe function, and sample transmission function. Notably, it measured probe spatial deviations of 500nm along the X - axis and 50nm along the Y - axis, which is not feasible by previous methods. With these experimentally proven advantages, we anticipate our method to be a powerful imaging tool with auto - quantitative calibration of various parameters. It will simplify scanning diffraction microscopy implementation and expand its application scope, especially in nanometer and atomic scale imaging.</description>

      <title>Stronger sum uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators</title>

Abstract: The uncertainty relations (URs) of two arbitrary Hermitian and non-Hermitian incompatible operators represented by the product of variances have been confirmed theoretically and experimentally in various physical systems. However, the lower bound of the product uncertainty inequality can be null even for two non-commuting operators, i.e., a trivial case. Therefore, for two incompatible operators over the measured system state, the associated URs regarding the sum of variances are valid in a state-dependent manner, and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial. Although the sum URs formulated for Hermitian and unitary operators have been affirmed, the general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not yet been investigated. This study presents the sum URs for non-Hermitian operators acting on system states using an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via the G-metric formalism. Concrete examples illustrate the validity of the proposed sum URs in both PT-symmetric and PT-broken phases. The developed methods and results can help give an in-depth understanding of the usefulness of G-metric formalism in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum URs of incompatible operators within.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Core Fiber Platform for Classical and Entangled Two-Photon Absorption Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a toluene-filled fiber platform for two-photon absorption measurements. By confining both the light and molecular sample inside the 5 $\mu$m hollow core of the fiber, we increase the distance over which the nonlinear light-matter interaction occurs. With only a 7.3 nL excitation volume, we measure classical two-photon absorption (C2PA) at an average laser power as low as 1.75 nW, which is a 45-fold improvement over a conventional free-space technique. We use this platform to attempt to measure entangled two-photon absorption (E2PA), a process with a limited regime where the quantum advantage is large. This regime arises due to a crossover from linear to quadratic scaling with photon flux as photon flux is increased. Recently, several teams of researchers have reported that E2PA cross-sections are much smaller than previously claimed. As a result, the linear scaling dominates at photon fluxes so low that it is extremely difficult or impossible to measure using conventional free-space techniques. In this report, we implement the first E2PA measurement using a waveguide. We see no evidence of E2PA, and we set an upper bound on the cross-section consistent with these recent reports.</description>

Abstract: Dry synthesis is a highly versatile method for the fabrication of nanoporous metal films, since it enables easy and reproducible deposition of single or multi-layer(s) of nanostructured materials that can find intriguing applications in plasmonics, photochemistry and photocatalysis, to name a few. Here, we extend the use of this methodology to the preparation of copper nanoislands that represent an affordable and versatile example of disordered plasmonic substrate. We perform detailed characterizations of the system using several techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, cathodoluminescence, electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation with the aim to investigate the optical properties of these systems in an unprecedented systematic way. Our study represents the starting point for future applications of this new disordered plasmonic system ranging from sensing to photochemistry and photocatalysis.</description>

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are vital for environmental monitoring due to their high temperature sensitivity, but their complex data poses challenges for predictive models. This study introduces Prion-ViT, a prion-inspired Vision Transformer model, inspired by biological prion memory mechanisms, to improve long-term dependency modeling and temperature prediction accuracy using FSS data. Prion-ViT leverages a persistent memory state to retain and propagate key features across layers, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.71$^\circ$C and outperforming models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and Standard Vision Transformers. This paper also discusses Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, providing a perspective on specklegrams through attention and saliency maps, which highlight key regions contributing to predictions</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement distribution in quantum networks will enable next-generation technologies for quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple users to share entanglement in a reconfigurable and multiplexed manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entanglement, or entanglement swapping. While several recent works have demonstrated fully connected, local multi-user networks based on multiplexing, extending this to a global network architecture of interconnected local networks remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate the next stage in the evolution of multiplexed quantum networks: a prototype global reconfigurable network where entanglement is routed and teleported in a flexible and multiplexed manner between two local multi-user networks composed of four users each. At the heart of our network is a programmable 8x8-dimensional multi-port circuit that harnesses the natural mode-mixing process inside a multi-mode fibre to implement on-demand high-dimensional operations on two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. Our circuit design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated photonic platforms. Our demonstration showcases the potential of this architecture for enabling large-scale, global quantum networks that offer versatile connectivity while being fully compatible with an existing communications infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Tomographic measurement data of states that never existed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09424</link>

Abstract: Microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat states are generated from quantum correlated fields using a probabilistic heralding photon subtraction event. Subsequent quantum state tomography provides complete information about the state with typical photon numbers of the order of one. Another approach strives for a larger number of quantum-correlated photons by conditioning the measurement analysis on events with exactly this number of photons. Here, we present a new approach to derive measurement data of quantum correlated states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one. We produce an ensemble of a heralded, photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light. We split the states at a balanced beam splitter and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures at the outputs using tomographic `Q-function homodyne detection' (QHD). The final act is probabilistic two-copy data post-processing aiming for data from a new state with larger photon number. Evaluating the final tomographic data as that of a grown microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat state shows that the probabilistic post-processing increased the photon number of $|\alpha_0|^2 \approx 1.2$ to $|\alpha_2|^2 \approx 6.8$. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that never existed might be a turning point in measurement-based quantum technology.</description>
