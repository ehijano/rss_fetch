      <title>Study on physical properties and characteristics of an anisotropic compact star model using Karmarkar Condition in F(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of physical parameters of an anisotropic compact star model demonstrating spherical symmetry in F(Q) modified gravity. To evaluate the behaviour and the stability of an anisotropic compact star model, we utilise the measured mass and radius of an anisotropic compact star model. This study obtained an anisotropic compact star model by solving Einstein field equations. The field equations have been simplified by an appropriate selection of the metric elements and the Karmarkar condition. By solving the field equation to develop a differential equation that establishes a relationship between two essential components of spacetime. A physical analysis of this model reveals that the resulting stellar structure for anisotropic matter distribution is a physically plausible representation of a compact star with an energy density of order $10^14 g/cm^3$. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov Condition, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and stability of the compact star Cen X-3. We further determined the mass-radius relation of this compact star for different values of delta}1.</description>

      <title>Strong-gravity precession resonances for binary systems orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>BHaHAHA: A Fast, Robust Apparent Horizon Finder Library for Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apparent horizon (AH) finders are essential for characterizing black holes and excising their interiors in numerical relativity (NR) simulations. However, open-source AH finders to date are tightly coupled to individual NR codes. We introduce BHaHAHA, the BlackHoles@Home Apparent Horizon Algorithm, the first open-source, infrastructure-agnostic library for AH finding in NR. BHaHAHA implements the first-ever hyperbolic flow-based approach, recasting the elliptic partial differential equation for a marginally outer trapped surface as a damped nonlinear wave equation. To enhance performance, BHaHAHA incorporates a multigrid-inspired refinement strategy, an over-relaxation technique, and OpenMP parallelization. When compared to a na\"ive hyperbolic relaxation implementation, these enhancements result in 64x speedups for difficult common-horizon finds on a single spacetime slice, enabling BHaHAHA to achieve runtimes within 10% of the widely used (single-core) AHFinderDirect and outperform it on multiple cores. For dynamic horizon tracking with typical core counts on a high-performance-computing cluster, BHaHAHA is approximately 2.1 times faster than AHFinderDirect at accuracies limited by interpolation of metric data from the host NR code. Implemented and tested in both the Einstein Toolkit and BlackHoles@Home, BHaHAHA demonstrates that hyperbolic relaxation can be a robust, versatile, and performant approach for AH finding.</description>

      <title>Geometric formulation of $k$-essence and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of geometries in which nonmetricity is fully determined by a vectorial degree of freedom and three independent coefficients. Formulating the simplest linear action in this geometry, implemented through Lagrange multipliers, naturally leads to an equivalence with the purely kinetic $k$-essence models with quadratic kinetic terms. A detailed dynamical systems analysis reveals that the $\Lambda$CDM phenomenology is embedded within the model. Crucially, we find that if stability conditions such as a positive sound speed squared and non-negative energy density are not enforced, the model generically exhibits instabilities and divergent behaviour in the phase space. These physical viability criteria allow us to isolate stable regions of the parameter space and derive well-motivated priors for parameter inference. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and late-time observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^{+}$ Type Ia supernovae, and DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, we constrain the degrees of freedom associated with nonmetricity and demonstrate the viability of the model. Remarkably, the model is found to be statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent cosmic tensions, and give a possible explanation as to why the equivalent $k$-essence models have been missed as serious competitors to $\Lambda$CDM in the past. Finally, we review the geometric foundations of the theory and show that the integrable Weyl, Schr\"{o}dinger and completely symmetric geometries are embedded within our framework as special cases.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quantum universe in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantize a Bianchi IX universe in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. For analytical tractability, we consider the small anisotropy limit of the Bianchi IX, that is, a perturbative anisotropic deformation of a closed, homogeneous and isotropic universe. In the case of the projectable theory we further set the ``dark matter as integration constant'' to zero by assuming that the space consists of only one connected piece. In that limit and under the assumption, we first study the semi-classical WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find the wave function of the universe, up to an overall normalization, and estimate the semi-classical tunneling probability for the emergence of an expanding universe. We establish a dictionary of correspondence between the WKB wave functions in General Relativity and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in the large-scale factor (or IR) limit. For a small universe (UV limit), on the other hand, due to contributions from higher-dimensional operators, the anisotropies decouple from the scale factor, a behavior significantly different from General Relativity, and analytic solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation beyond the WKB approximation can be found. The wave function of the scale factor satisfies the DeWitt criterion, whereas the wave functions of anisotropies resemble those of quantum harmonic oscillators. The quantum prediction for the initial condition of anisotropies is obtained in terms of the coupling parameters of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. We find a bound on the coupling parameters from the normalizability of the wave functions of anisotropies. Further, we calculate the expectation values for squared anisotropic shear and squared anisotropies in both the large universe and small universe limits.</description>

      <title>From Nonextremal to Extremal: Entropy of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the entropy of Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) and Kerr black holes using the Hawking-Gibbons path integral method. We determine the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate using two approaches: first, by analyzing the near-horizon geometry, and second, by applying the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet (CGB) theorem. For non-extremal cases, both these methods yield a consistent and unique periodicity, which in turn leads to a well-defined expression for the entropy. In contrast, the extremal case exhibits a crucial difference. The absence of a conical structure in the near-horizon geometry implies that the periodicity of the Euclidean time is no longer uniquely fixed within the Hawking-Gibbons framework. The CGB theorem also fails to constrain the periodicity, as the corresponding Euler characteristic vanishes. As a result, the entropy cannot be uniquely determined using either method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sheet Wormholes in the Gravitational Soliton Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically construct static regular solutions describing wormholes that connect multiple asymptotic regions, supported by a phantom scalar field. The solutions are static and axially symmetric, and are constructed using the gravitational soliton formalism, in which the equations of motion reduce to the Laplace equations on a two-dimensional sheet. However, the presence of multiple asymptotic regions necessitates the introduction of multiple such sheets. These sheets are appropriately cut and glued together to form a globally regular geometry. This gluing procedure represents the principal distinction from conventional Weyl-type solitonic solutions and is a characteristic feature of the wormhole geometries studied in this paper.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Exotic Compact Binaries with Gravitational Waves: a Phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has been hailed as a gateway to discovering unexpected phenomena in the universe. Over the last decade there have been close to one hundred GW observations of compact-binary mergers. While these signals are largely consistent with mergers of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, or black hole-neutron star systems, some events suggest the intriguing possibility of binaries involving exotic compact objects (ECOs). Identifying and characterising an ECO merger would require accurate ECO waveform models. Using large numbers of numerical relativity simulations to develop customised models for ECO mergers akin to those used for binary black holes, would be not only computationally expensive but also challenging due to the limited understanding of the underlying physics. Alternatively, key physical imprints of the ECO on the inspiral or merger could in principle be incorporated phenomenologically into waveform models, sufficient to quantify generic properties. In this work we present a first application of this idea to assess the detectability and distinguishability of ECO mergers, and we propose a phenomenological approach that can iteratively incorporate features of ECO mergers, laying the groundwork for an effective exotic compact object identifier in compact binary coalescences. We demonstrate that within this framework the compactness of the objects in GW150914 are consistent with that of black holes. The efficacy of the identifier can be refined by adding information from numerical relativity simulations involving fundamental fields. Conversely, such an identifier framework can help focus future numerical relativity and modeling efforts for exotic objects.</description>

      <title>Exploring parametrized dark energy models in interacting scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied the dynamics of accelerating universe considering a simple parametrization of the equation of state parameter in an interacting scenario. In this toy model, the dark energy component is allowed to interact with the dark matter component through a source term. The expressions for various relevant cosmological parameters for the proposed parametrized model have been obtained and it has been found that the proposed model consistently drives the late time cosmic acceleration of the universe. We have also carried out the Bayesian analysis using recent observational datasets in order to obtain the best fit values of the model parameters. It has been found that the dark energy model with $Q \propto H\rho_{de}$ can provide a possible resolution of the Hubble tension in an interacting scenario where the dark energy component decays into the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse of matter fields in de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of matter fields in the de Sitter universe. The energy-momentum tensor of the matter field is assumed to admit a wide variety including dust, perfect fluids with equations of state, fluids with tangential and radial pressure, and with bulk and shear viscosity. Under different initial conditions imposed on the velocity and the density profiles, and by combining the results from exact analytical methods with those obtained from numerical techniques, we track the formation and evolution of spherical marginally trapped spheres as the matter suffers continual gravitational collapse. We show that the quasilocal formalism of trapped surfaces provides an ideal framework to study the evolution of horizons. More precisely, black hole and cosmological horizons may be viewed as the time development of marginally trapped surfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Detection Pipelines of Taiji: New Challenges in Data Analysis and High-Fidelity Simulations of Space-Borne Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taiji, a Chinese space-based gravitational wave detection project, aims to explore the millihertz gravitational wave universe with unprecedented sensitivity, targeting astrophysical and cosmological sources including Galactic binaries, massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, etc. These observations are expected to provide transformative insights into astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. However, Taiji's data analysis faces unique challenges distinct from ground-based detectors like LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, such as the overlap of numerous signals, extended data durations, more rigorous accuracy requirements for the waveform templates, non-negligible subdominant waveform complexities, incompletely characterized noise spectra, non-stationary noises, and various data anomalies. This paper presents the second round of Taiji Data Challenge, a collection of simulation datasets designed as a shared platform for resolving these critical data analysis problems. The current platform distinguishes from previous works by the systematic integration of orbital dynamics based on the full drag-free and attitude control simulation, extended noise sources, more sophisticated and overlapping gravitational wave signals, second-generation time-delay interferometry and the coupling effect of time-varying armlengths, etc. Concurrently released is the open-source toolkit Triangle, which offers the capabilities for customized simulation of signals, noises and other instrumental effects. By taking a step further towards realistic detection, Taiji Data Challenge II and Triangle altogether serve as a new testbed, supporting the development of Taiji's global analysis and end-to-end pipelines, and ultimately bridging the gaps between observation and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Circular equatorial orbits of extended bodies with spin-induced quadrupole around a Kerr black hole: Comparing spin-supplementary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldline of an extended body in curved spacetime can be described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations when its centroid, i.e., its center of mass, is fixed by a spin supplementary condition (SSC). Different SSC choices result in distinct worldlines. To examine the properties of these choices, we investigate the frequency of circular equatorial orbits of extended bodies within the pole-dipole-(spin-induced) quadrupole approximation moving around a Kerr black hole for the Tulzcyjew-Dixon (TD) and the Mathisson-Pirani (MP) SSCs. First, we examine similarities and discrepancies in the prograde and retrograde orbital frequencies by expanding these frequencies in power series of the spin without taking into account the fact that both the position of the centroid and the spin measure change under the transition from one SSC to another. Then, by taking into account the centroid transition laws we examine the orbital frequencies convergence between the non-helical MP frame to the TD frame. In particular, we demonstrate that, in analogy to the pole-dipole approximation, the transition from one circular orbit to another within the pole-dipole-(spin-induced)quadrupole approximation under a change in the SSC, results in convergence between the SSCs only up to certain terms in the spin expansion and does not extend to the entire power series. Finally, we discuss the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) in the pole-dipole-(spin-induced)quadrupole approximation under TD and MP SSCs.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and decay of waves on spatially flat decelerated FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear wave equation on a class of spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in the decelerated regime with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}^3$. Employing twisted $t$-weighted multiplier vector fields, we establish uniform energy bounds and derive integrated local energy decay estimates across the entire range of the decelerated expansion regime. Furthermore, we obtain a hierarchy of $r^p$-weighted energy estimates \`a la the Dafermos-Rodnianski $r^p$-method, which leads to energy decay estimates. As a consequence, we demonstrate pointwise decay estimates for solutions and their derivatives. In the wave zone, this pointwise decay is optimal in the "radiation" and "sub-radiation" cases, and almost optimal around the radiation case.</description>

      <title>Sequential simulation-based inference for extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals pose a difficult challenge in terms of both search and parameter estimation for upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. Their signals are long and of complex morphology, meaning they carry a large amount of information about their source, but are also difficult to search for and analyse. We explore how sequential simulation-based inference methods, specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation, could offer solutions to some of the challenges surrounding extreme-mass-ratio inspiral data analysis. We show that this method can efficiently narrow down the volume of the complex 11-dimensional search parameter space by a factor of $10^6-10^7$ and provide 1-dimensional marginal proposal distributions for non-spinning extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We discuss the current limitations of this approach and place it in the broader context of a global strategy for future space-based gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model of quantum cosmology: the Hydrogen atom analogy with dust and Cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with pressureless dust (modeled via the Brown-Kucha\v{r} formalism) and a dynamical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ treated in the unimodular gravity framework, where unimodular time serves as a relational clock. Remarkably, the quantum dynamics of this system exhibit a mathematical correspondence to a non-relativistic hydrogen atom -- $\Lambda$ maps to energy eigenvalues, the volume variable to the radial coordinate, and the dust energy density parameter to the Coulomb potential strength. This analogy yields a continuous spectrum for positive $\Lambda$, analogous to scattering states. For $\Lambda &gt; 0$, we prove the self-adjointness of the unimodular Hamiltonian, guaranteeing unitary evolution in unimodular time. By constructing wave packets from normalized stationary states, we demonstrate a quantum bounce that resolves the classical Big Bang singularity. The dynamics transition from semiclassical behavior far from the bounce to quantum-dominated regions featuring characteristic "ringing" oscillations due to interference near the bounce. We quantify quantum effects through expectation values and fluctuations of cosmological observables, finding evidence for persistent quantum effects in the late universe. Thus our results suggest that quantum gravitational effects may leave imprints on late-time cosmology, even beyond the bounce.</description>

      <title>Test-Field vs Physical Quasi-Normal Modes in Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the general effort to model black hole dynamics, and in particular their return-to-equilibrium through quasi-normal modes, it is crucial to understand how much test-field perturbations deviate from physical perturbations in modified gravity scenarios. On the one hand, physical perturbations follow the modified Einstein equations of the considered extension of general relativity. The complexity of those equations can quickly escalate with extra fields and non-linear couplings. On the other hand, test-field perturbations, with negligible back-reaction on the space-time geometry, describe the propagation of both matter fields and spin $s=2$ gravitational waves on the black hole geometry. They are not subject to the intricacies of the modified Einstein equations, and only probe the background spacetime metric. If their physics were to not deviate significantly from physical perturbations, they would be especially useful to investigate predictions from quantum gravity scenarios which lack explicit detailed Einstein equations.
  Here we focus on a specific modified gravity solution -- BCL black holes in scalar-tensor theories -- for which physical perturbations and related QNM frequencies have already been studied and computed numerically. We compute the test-field QNM frequencies and compare the two QNM spectra. This provides a concrete example of the significant differences arising between test-fields and physical perturbations, and flags unphysical deviations related to the test-field framework.</description>

      <title>Derivative coupling in horizon brightened acceleration radiation: a quantum optics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) signifies a unique radiation process and provides a promising framework in exploring acceleration radiation in flat/ curved spacetime. Its construction primarily relies on the transition probability of an atom falling through a high-Q cavity while interacting with a quantum field. The HBAR effect has typically been explored in the context of minimal coupling between the atom and the field amplitude. However, the minimally coupled models are affected by the infrared (IR) divergences that arise in the massless limit of the quantum fields in (1+1) dimensions. Thus, in the present manuscript, we examine the HBAR process using both the point-like and finite size detectors coupled with the momentum of the field, which plays a crucial role in naturally resolving IR divergences. Our results suggest that the transition probability for the point-like detector is independent of its frequency. This can be interpreted as the influence of the local gravitational field which modifies the sensitivity of the detector to its frequency and broadens its effective frequency range. Through a comparative study based on the length of the detector, we find that for a detector with a smaller length, the steady state solution for the density matrix of the field vanishes. This may indicate the existence of a non equilibrium thermodynamic state under the condition of finite size detector-field interaction. These distinctive features are exclusive to the derivative coupling between the atom and the field, highlighting them as a compelling subject for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach and cosmological attractors in newer general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics of a class of symmetric teleparallel gravity theories known as ``newer general relativity'' using the methods of dynamical systems, restricted to the case of vacuum solutions with a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. For the most general class of theories, we study generic properties of the solutions, in particular their fixed points, asymptotic behavior and effective dark energy. We then apply this approach to two phenomenologically motivated subclasses of theories, which we study in full detail. For these theories, we derive the complete space of solutions and cosmological attractors, which we display in a number of phase diagram. Depending on the particular theory at hand, we find different possible scenarios, including a turnaround followed by a big crunch, a big rip and an eternally expanding universe whose Hubble parameter asymptotically approaches zero. It turns that this different behavior can be explained by the effective dark energy barotropic index, which shows either phantom or non-phantom behavior, depending on the theory, but does not change dynamically between these two possibilities.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gravity from Topological Quantum Field Theory: Stochastic Gradient Flow Perspective away from the Quantum Gravity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scenario according to which the ultraviolet completion of General Relativity is realized through a stochastic gradient flow towards a topological BF theory. Specifically, we consider the stochastic gradient flow of a pre-geometric theory proposed by Wilczek. Its infrared limit exists, and corresponds to a fixed point where stochastic fluctuations vanish. Diffeomorphism symmetries are restored in this limit, where the theory is classical and expressed by the Einstein-Hilbert action. The infrared phase then corresponds to the classical theory of General Relativity, the quantization of which becomes meaningless. Away from the infrared limit, in the pre-geometric phase of the stochastic gradient flow, the relevant fields of the Wilczek theory undergo stochastic fluctuations. The theory can be quantized perturbatively, generating corrections to the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. The stochastic gradient flow also possesses an ultraviolet fixed point. The theory flows to a topological BF action, to which general non-perturbative quantization methods can be applied. Two phase transitions occur along the thermal time dynamics, being marked by: i) the breakdown of the topological BF symmetries in the ultraviolet regime, which originates the pre-geometric phase described by the Wilczek theory; ii) the breakdown of the parental symmetries characterizing the Wilczek theory, from which General Relativity emerges. The problem of quantizing the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity finally becomes redundant.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk.
  Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.
  We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).</description>

      <title>Observers seeing gravitational Hilbert spaces: abstract sources for an abstract path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral suggests a striking result: the Hilbert space of closed universes in each superselection sector, a so-called $\alpha$-sector, is one-dimensional. We develop an abstract formalism encapsulating recent proposals that modify the gravitational path integral in the presence of observers and allow larger Hilbert spaces to be associated with closed universes. Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from abstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional objects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together. We apply this formalism to treat, on equal footing, universes with spatial boundaries, closed universes with prescribed observer worldlines, and closed universes containing observers entangled with external systems. In these contexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by partial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $\alpha$-sectors supporting noncommuting operators. Within our general framework, the positivity of the gravitational inner product implies a bound on the Hilbert space trace of certain positive operators over each $\alpha$-sector. The trace of such operators, in turn, quantifies the effective size of this Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a free massive scalar field at its ground state in (3+1)-dimensional AdS space in global coordinates. We consider spherical entangling surfaces centered at the origin of AdS. We determine the structure of the UV-divergent terms in the entanglement entropy and compute the numerical values of the respective coefficients. We confirm the connection between the coefficient of the logarithmic term and the conformal anomaly.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of tetrad gravity: Unlike diffeomorphisms, all shifts are integrable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved notion of internal tetrad shifts in 4 dimensions which is always integrable in the presence of corners. This allows us to study the fully extended corner symmetry algebra of gauge charges, which is a deformation of $ISO(1,3)^S$ involving spacetime curvature. We argue this implies corner noncommutativity of the spin connection $\omega$. The latter in particular hints that an extended BF theory might be a better way understand the dynamics of tetrad gravity. This result presents us with an integrable, complete set of edge modes for gravity in 4D, with potential ramifications for asymptotic symmetries and quantisation.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven: Linking Observables in Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions of inflaton and graviton perturbations are the fundamental observables of early universe cosmology and remain a primary target for observations. In this work, we ask the following question: are these observables independent of one another? We find that in the parity-odd sector of inflationary perturbation theory, the answer is a resounding no! In earlier work we derived a correlator-to-correlator factorisation formula which states that parity-odd correlators factorise into lower-point correlators under some mild assumptions on the underlying theory. In this work, we show that these assumptions are satisfied in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity where the action of minimal inflation is augmented by a coupling between the inflaton and the gravitational Chern-Simons term. Such a theory gives rise to a parity-odd trispectrum of curvature perturbations, and we show that such a trispectrum can be expressed solely in terms of the bispectrum that arises due to the minimal coupling between the inflaton and graviton, and the graviton power spectrum which receives a parity-odd correction in this theory. The trispectrum is quadratic in this mixed inflaton-graviton bispectrum and can therefore be interpreted as a ``double copy". Our final expression for the parity-odd trispectrum is a relatively simple function of the external momenta that is rational and factorised.</description>

Abstract: We report two exact classical solutions in two-dimensional singular spaces. These solutions are lower-dimensional versions of some five-dimensional brane world solutions. Unlike the higher-dimensional model, our solutions have exactly solvable linear perturbation equations, namely, Schr\"odinger-like equations with P\"oschl-Teller I potential and Eckart potential. Both potentials are shape-invariant and can be solved exactly using supersymmetric quantum mechanics methods. In our work, the P\"oschl-Teller I potential has infinitely many bound states, while the Eckart potential captures a finite number of bound states. Both potentials are positive-definite which indicates that the background solutions are stable against linear perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alvarez-Dominguez, Garay, Martin-Martinez, and Polo-Gomez have suggested that ``it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario,'' and ``the dissipation of energy via Schwinger effect alone is enough to prevent the formation of kugelblitze with radii ranging from $10^{-29}$ to $10^8$ m.'' While I agree that it is indeed highly implausible that black holes will form mainly from light in our actual universe, either naturally or by any foreseeable human activity, there are many idealized theoretical processes for forming black holes of any size down to near the Planck length (about $10^{-35}$ m) purely from photons, such as from colliding approximately plane-wave pulses, with only a small fraction of the energy escaping the black hole as scattered light or electron-positron pairs.</description>

Abstract: Recently it is asserted that the standard beta function does not describe the correct running of the coupling constant in some theories. We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton constant run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spectral functionals associated with Dirac and Laplace-type differential operators on manifolds, defined via the Wodzicki residue, extending classical results for Dirac operators derived from the Levi-Civita connection to geometries with torsion. The local densities of these functionals recover fundamental geometric tensors, including the volume form, Riemannian metric, scalar curvature, Einstein tensor, and torsion tensor. Additionally, we introduce chiral spectral functionals using a grading operator, which yields novel spectral invariants. These constructions offer a richer spectral-geometric characterization of manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</description>

Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been suggested to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there lacks effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it can be applied to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory is applicable to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

Abstract: The so-called generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole is a modification of the standard Ellis-Bronnikov solution, in which a parameter $m&gt;2$ is introduced-recovering the original Ellis-Bronnikov geometry when $m=2$. In this work, we investigate the properties of this spacetime by analyzing its embedding diagrams and how they are affected by variations in the parameter $m$. Furthermore, we study the accretion of dust (a pressureless fluid) onto this geometry, showing that-unlike in black hole scenarios-the radial infall velocity of the dust decreases as it approaches the wormhole throat, with this deceleration becoming increasingly abrupt for larger values of $m$. As a main result, we demonstrate that this geometry arises as an exact solution of General Relativity when considering the combined presence of a phantom scalar field and a magnetic or electric source.</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Emission and detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from highly eccentric orbits of compact binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrahigh frequency emission of gravitational waves by binary systems of black holes has recently been investigated in details in the framework of new experimental ideas around resonant cavities. In this article, we consider the case of elliptic trajectories. At fixed masses and frequency, we conclude that the total amount of energy radiated by the system within the bandwidth of the detector can be significantly higher than for circular orbits. However, owing to subtle experimental effects, the signal-to-noise ratio is, overall, a decreasing function of the eccentricity. Limits on the maximum distance at which a merging system of black holes can be detected derived are therefore not improved by considering elliptic trajectories, when compared to the circular case. The article is written as pedagogically as possible so as to be accessible to the nonfamiliar reader and possibly useful beyond the ultrahigh frequency case.</description>

      <title>On the low-energy limit of stationary and axisymmetric solutions in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy limit of General Relativity in the presence of stationarity and axial symmetry, coupled to dust. Specifically, we demonstrate that differences between the dynamics of General Relativity and those of Newtonian gravity persist even in the weak-field and slow-motion regime. Notably, these differences are driven by dragging terms that are not necessarily small, as is typically the case in the well-known gravitomagnetic limit. To highlight this distinction, we use the concept of strong gravitomagnetism that we introduced in previous works. We provide a pedagogical discussion of how these discrepancies arise and outline a systematic procedure to solve the equations of motion for such systems. Furthermore, we present analytical results for specific cases and also give the general solution for the vacuum case. A particularly notable result is our demonstration of how General Relativity can naturally account for a Tully-Fisher-like relation.</description>

      <title>Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum properties of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.</description>

      <title>Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion in the limit where distances are large with respect to the size of the horizon, $z=2M/r\ll 1$ (Post-Minkowskian approximation), but small with respect to the gravitational wavelength, $y=2{\rm i} \omega r\ll 1$ (Post-Newtonian approximation). While in the case of bounded systems the two expansions are linked, for scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption $\omega M\ll 1$. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions and provide a new derivation of the recently discovered Heun connection formulae. Similar results are found for the non-confluent Heun case. Finally, in the case of circular orbits we compute our formulae at order 30PN and show excellent agreement against solutions obtained via numerical integrations and the MST method.</description>

Abstract: We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant where the source of the gravitational field consists of a magnetic field and dust. In particular, we restrict our study to the case of Bianchi type III models. All these solutions either start with a singularity and then expand, or they are initially collapsing and end at a singularity. We discuss the physical meaning of the parameters appearing in the metrics and examine the possible subcases and the relative importance of the dust and the magnetic field as we approach the singularity.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, for an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with arbitrary dynamical critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. In the classical approach, we comment on potential limitations while choosing the turning point of the null geodesic in our gravity background. All chaotic properties emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. Finally, we remark on a possible classical/quantum correspondence from the analysis of classical eikonal phase shift and Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." In some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM. When nonrelativistic matter is added to the holographic dark energy, it tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. We show that a long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a more limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds on parity-violating scalar-tensor EFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using dispersion relations of the scattering amplitudes and semi-definite programming, we calculate causality bounds on the Wilson coefficients in scalar-tensor effective field theories that include parity-violating operators. Particular attention has been paid to the dynamical-Chern-Simons (dCS) and scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, along with higher order coefficients, and the interplay between them. For the leading terms, the bounds on the parity-conserving and -violating coefficients are simply projections of the complex coefficients. Some parity-violating coefficients are found to be upper bounded by the parity-conserving counterparts, or the higher order parity-conserving coefficients. While the observational constraints on parity-violating coefficients are weaker than the parity-conserving counterparts, the causality bounds are of comparable strength and thus may play a more prominent role in constraining strong gravity effects in upcoming observations.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The $p$-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>Quantum response theory and momentum-space gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Can black holes preserve $N &gt; 4$ supersymmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>
