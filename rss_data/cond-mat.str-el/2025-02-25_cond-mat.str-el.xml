      <title>Proximity-Induced Nodal Metal in an Extremely Underdoped CuO$_2$ Plane in Triple-Layer Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ARPES studies have established that the high-$T_c$ cuprates with single and double CuO$_2$ layers evolve from the Mott insulator to the pseudogap state with a Fermi arc, on which the superconducting (SC) gap opens. In four- to six-layer cuprates, on the other hand, small hole Fermi pockets are formed in the innermost CuO$_2$ planes, indicating antiferromagnetism. Here, we performed ARPES studies on the triple-layer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ over a wide doping range, and found that, although the doping level of the inner CuO$_2$ plane was extremely low in underdoped samples, the $d$-wave SC gap was enhanced to the unprecedentedly large value of $\Delta_0\sim$100 meV at the antinode and persisted well above $T_{{c}}$ without the appearance of a Fermi arc, indicating a robust ``nodal metal''. We attribute the nodal metallic behavior to the unique local environment of the inner clean CuO$_2$ plane in the triple-layer cuprates, sandwiched by nearly optimally-doped two outer CuO$_2$ planes and hence subject to strong proximity effect from both sides. In the nodal metal, quasiparticle peaks showed electron-hole symmetry, suggesting $d$-wave pairing fluctuations. Thus the proximity effect on the innermost CuO${_2}$ plane is the strongest in the triple-layer cuprates, which explains why the $T_c$ reaches the maximum at the layer number of three in every multi-layer cuprate family.</description>

      <title>Site-selective observation of spin dynamics of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in frustrated Heisenberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy spin dynamics is investigated by $^{35}$ Cl NMR measurements in a frustrated antiferromagnet Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$. The local spin susceptibility measured with the Knight shift behaves as a one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet and remains constant down to low temperatures, as expected in a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ demonstrates a slowing down of atomic motions and a power-law evolution of spin correlation. The Luttinger parameter is enhanced in a site-selective manner depending on the form factor of dynamical spin susceptibility. The strong anisotropy of $T_1^{-1}$ reflects the strong spin-orbit coupling through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The ground state exhibits an incommensurate antiferromagnetic ordering with low-lying magnon excitations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of out-of-equilibrium Kondo effect and Coulomb blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of numerically exact results for the Anderson model of a quantum dot coupled to two electrodes in non-equilibrium regime. We use a high order perturbative expansion in power of the interaction $U$, coupled to a cross-extrapolation method to long time and large interaction. The perturbative series is computed up to $20-25$ orders, using tensor cross-interpolation. We calculate the full Coulomb diamond bias voltage - gate voltage map, including its Kondo ridge, that forms the standard experimental signature of the Coulomb blockage and the Kondo effect. We present current-voltage characteristics that spans three orders of magnitude in bias voltage and display five different regimes of interest from probing the Kondo resonance at small bias to saturation at very high bias. Our technique also naturally produces time-resolved interaction quenches which we use to study the dynamics of the formation of the Kondo cloud. Finally, we predict several qualitatively new physical features that should be within reach of existing or upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge-state dependent spin-orbit coupling and quantum phase transitions in Ir-Ru oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between kinematic, relativistic and Coulombic interactions in iridium-based oxides has spurred intense experimental and theoretical investigations regarding the electronic structure and magnetism. We argue here that the Iridium-Ruthenium triple perovskites, Ba$_3$MRuIrO$_9$ (M = Li, Mg and In), are of particular interest in this regard. We show here, using ab-initio theory, that the nominal charge states of Ir can be tuned from +6 to +4 by choosing non-magnetic 'M' ions as Li (+1), Mg(+2) and In (+3). This variation modulates the influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which is found here to be negligible in Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$, moderate in Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and determining in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. Our analysis classifies Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ as a band-insulator, Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ as a SOC and correlation driven insulator and Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ as $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Mott-Hubbard insulator. As reported here, correlated electronic structure theory results in sizeable magnetic moments of both Ru and Ir atoms in these systems and atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the experimental N\'eel temperature for Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ and Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and provide evidence for a phase transition for Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ when T $\to$ 0 K, to a multi-valley magnetic state with strong magnetic frustration. The theory identifies the presence of Kitaev interaction among the iridium atoms in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. The realization of such strong anisotropic interactions helps to stabilize a particularly complex energy landscape of Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$, that opens up for exotic magnetic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Inversion-asymmetric itinerant antiferromagnets by the space group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of an inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnetism due to an itinerant mechanism in nonsymmorphic systems with magnetic ions at Wyckoff position of multiplicity 2. The key symmetries which underpin the existence of such phases are established, and we derive a Landau free energy from a general microscopic electronic Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that the stable antiferromagnetic order is largely determined by the symmetries of Wyckoff position, the nature of the nesting between electronic bands, and the presence of anisotropy or nesting in high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone. We illustrate our conclusions with specific microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge Kondo effect for a quantum dot with side coupled Majorana zero mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a Majorana zero mode and a normal lead. We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics and resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Loop-current order through the kagome looking glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In loop-current states, interacting electronic degrees of freedom collectively establish interatomic currents, in a rare example of magnetism in which spin degrees of freedom do not play the primary role. The main impact of such states on the electronic spectrum is not via the standard Zeeman term, but via the kinetic energy, in which hopping parameters develop non-trivial phases that break time-reversal symmetry. The recent proposal of loop-current states in kagome superconductors has stimulated renewed interest in this exotic type of magnetism. In this perspective, we use kagome materials as a scaffolding to frame the basic phenomenology of loop-current states. We provide an overview of the group-theoretical properties of loop currents, as well as of relevant microscopic models and ab initio methods. Particular emphasis is given to the comparison with spin-density waves in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as well as to the anharmonic coupling with charge-density waves, which is present in systems with threefold rotational symmetry. We also provide a brief overview of the current status of loop-current order in kagome metals and discuss open challenges including their experimental detection and interplay with other orders.</description>

      <title>Modulation of superconductivity across a Lifshitz transition in alternating-angle twisted quadrilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report electric field-controlled modulation of the Fermi surface topology and explore its effects on the superconducting state in alternating-angle twisted quadrilayer graphene (TQG). The unique combination of flat and dispersive bands in TQG allows us to simultaneously tune the band structure through carrier density, $n$, and displacement field, $D$. From density-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations and Hall measurements, we quantify the $D$-dependent bandwidth of the flat and dispersive bands and their hybridization. In the high $|D|$ regime, the increased bandwidth favors the single particle bands, which coincides exactly with the vanishing of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, showing that superconductivity in TQG is strongly bound to the symmetry-broken state. For a range of lower $|D|$ values, a Lifshitz transition occurs when the flat and dispersive band Fermi surfaces merge within the $\nu=+2$ symmetry-broken state. The superconducting state correspondingly shows an enhanced $T_c$, suggesting that the superconducting condensate is strongly dependent on the Fermi surface topology and density of states within this symmetry-broken state.</description>

      <title>Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by two concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. We conclude our letter with guidelines for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Random Transverse Field Effects on Magnetic Noise in Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated electronic state in a ferrimagnetic quadruple perovskite CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently synthesized quadruple perovskite CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ possesses strong ferromagnetism and unusual electron properties, including enhanced electronic specific heat. Application of the first principles electronic structure approaches unambiguously shows importance of the many-body effects in this compound. While CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ is half-metallic ferrimagnet in the DFT+U method, in the density functional theory (DFT) combined with the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) it appears to be a metal. Strong correlations lead to a renormalization of electronic spectrum and formation of incoherent states close to the Fermi level. Electronic specific heat and magnetic properties obtained in the DFT+DMFT approach are in better agreement with available experimental data than derived by other band structure techniques.</description>

      <title>Universal charge and spin Drude weights in one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drude weight (DW) is one of the most important quantities characterizing the quantum transport properties of many-body systems. Despite of intense studies of many decades, there still lacks rigorous understanding of transport behavior for various quantum phases at low temperatures. Here we report on universal properties of DWs in one-dimensional repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary magnetic fields. In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the DWs.We find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.</description>

      <title>Importance of ligand on-site interactions for the description of Mott-insulators in DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations combining density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for transition metal (TM) oxides and similar compounds usually focus on improving the description of the TM $d$ states. Here, we emphasize the importance of also accounting for corrections of the ligand $p$ states. We demonstrate that focusing exclusively on an improved description of the TM $d$ states results in difficulties to obtain the correct insulating behavior for a variety of materials, and requires to use values for the local interaction parameters that are inconsistent with values obtained using, e.g., the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Importantly, these considerations not only apply to cases where the $p$ states are explicitly included in the DMFT low-energy subspace, but also to cases which only include so-called frontier bands with dominant TM $d$ character. We demonstrate that, to a large part, these inconsistencies arise from the use of local/semi-local DFT as starting point for computing interaction parameters within cRPA, and we show that applying a simple empirical correction to the O $p$ and other low energy states not included in the correlated subspace results in improved values for the interaction parameters that then allow to obtain the correct insulating behavior. For the cases where the ligand states are included in the DMFT subspace, we show that even an approximate but realistic Hartree-Fock-like correction applied to the O $p$ states leads to a correct and, most importantly, also a quantitatively consistent DFT+DMFT description of typical Mott insulators such as LaTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$, or the perovskite rare-earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Fermi-liquid behavior by interactions in disordered metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering in correlated Fermi liquids by the disordered Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory with an IPT-CPA solver. We find significant violations of Matthiessen's rule (additivity of scattering mechanisms) which we explain in terms of the screening of the disorder potential by interactions, leading to a protection of the electron-electron inelastic scattering rate against disorder. We also show that large disorder can lead to a surprising enhancement of the electron-electron scattering that contrasts with the competition seen in the elastic channel. Our results compare positively with available resistivity data in the disordered Fermi liquid phase of the correlated organic metals $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$X, and rationalize the strong sample dependence of the $T^2$ coefficients observed in the resistivity of correlated perovskite oxides such as SrVO$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.</description>

      <title>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott semimetal and symmetric pseudogap metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that Mott physics in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be conveniently captured using the ancilla theory, originally proposed in the context of high-Tc cuprates [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.</description>

      <title>Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Callan-Rubakov effects in topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</description>

      <title>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moir\'e heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SCALINN -- Strongly Correlated Approach with Language Inspired Neural Network -- as a method for solving the Anderson impurity model and reducing the computational cost of dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Inspired by the success of generative Transformer networks in natural language processing, SCALINN utilizes an in-house modified Transformer network in order to learn correlated Matsubara Green's functions, which act as solutions to the impurity model. This is achieved by providing the network with low-cost Matsubara Green's functions, thereby overcoming the computational cost of high accuracy solutions. Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07613v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Higher Landau-Level Analogs and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations</title>

Abstract: We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</description>

      <title>Novel electronic state of honeycomb iridate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Qubit Regularization of Quantum Field Theories</title>

Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>
