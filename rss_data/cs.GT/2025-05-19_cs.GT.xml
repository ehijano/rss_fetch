      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</description>

      <title>Robust Equilibria in Shared Resource Allocation via Strengthening Border's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider repeated allocation of a shared resource via a non-monetary mechanism, wherein a single item must be allocated to one of multiple agents in each round. We assume that each agent has i.i.d. values for the item across rounds, and additive utilities. Past work on this problem has proposed mechanisms where agents can get one of two kinds of guarantees: $(i)$ (approximate) Bayes-Nash equilibria via linkage-based mechanisms which need extensive knowledge of the value distributions, and $(ii)$ simple distribution-agnostic mechanisms with robust utility guarantees for each individual agent, which are worse than the Nash outcome, but hold irrespective of how others behave (including possibly collusive behavior). Recent work has hinted at barriers to achieving both simultaneously. Our work however establishes this is not the case, by proposing the first mechanism in which each agent has a natural strategy that is both a Bayes-Nash equilibrium and also comes with strong robust guarantees for individual agent utilities.
  Our mechanism comes out of a surprising connection between the online shared resource allocation problem and implementation theory. In particular, we show that establishing robust equilibria in this setting reduces to showing that a particular subset of the Border polytope is non-empty. We establish this via a novel joint Schur-convexity argument. This strengthening of Border's criterion for obtaining a stronger conclusion is of independent technical interest, as it may prove useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Risk Mitigation in LLM Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) enable novel use cases in domains where responsible action is increasingly important. Yet the inherent unpredictability of LLMs raises safety concerns about agent reliability. In this work, we explore agent behaviour in a toy, game-theoretic environment based on a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. We introduce a strategy-modification method-independent of both the game and the prompt-by steering the residual stream with interpretable features extracted from a sparse autoencoder latent space. Steering with the good-faith negotiation feature lowers the average defection probability by 28 percentage points. We also identify feasible steering ranges for several open-source LLM agents. Finally, we hypothesise that game-theoretic evaluation of LLM agents, combined with representation-steering alignment, can generalise to real-world applications on end-user devices and embodied platforms.</description>

      <title>Decision Making in Urban Traffic: A Game Theoretic Approach for Autonomous Vehicles Adhering to Traffic Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in urban autonomous vehicle decision-making and planning lies in effectively managing intricate interactions with diverse traffic participants characterized by unpredictable movement patterns. Additionally, interpreting and adhering to traffic regulations within rapidly evolving traffic scenarios pose significant hurdles. This paper proposed a rule-based autonomous vehicle decision-making and planning framework which extracts right-of-way from traffic rules to generate behavioural parameters, integrating them to effectively adhere to and navigate through traffic regulations. The framework considers the strong interaction between traffic participants mathematically by formulating the decision-making and planning problem into a differential game. By finding the Nash equilibrium of the problem, the autonomous vehicle is able to find optimal decisions. The proposed framework was tested under simulation as well as full-size vehicle platform, the results show that the ego vehicle is able to safely interact with surrounding traffic participants while adhering to traffic rules.</description>

      <title>Unsolvability and Beyond in Many-To-Many Non-Bipartite Stable Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Stable Fixtures problem, a many-to-many generalisation of the classical non-bipartite Stable Roommates matching problem. Building on the foundational work of Tan on stable partitions, we extend his results to this significantly more general setting and develop a rich framework for understanding stable structures in many-to-many contexts. Our main contribution, the notion of a generalised stable partition (GSP), not only characterises the solution space of this problem, but also serves as a versatile tool for reasoning about ordinal preference systems with capacity constraints.
  We show that GSPs can be computed efficiently and provide an elegant representation of a problem instance, tightly characterising its preference structure and succinctly certifying the existence and non-existence of stable matchings. Leveraging a connection to stable half matchings, we also establish a non-bipartite analogue of the Rural Hospitals Theorem for stable half-matchings and GSPs, and connect our results to recent work on near-feasible matchings, providing a simpler algorithm and tighter analysis for this problem. Our work also addresses the computational challenges of finding optimal stable half-matchings and GSPs, presenting a flexible integer linear programming model for various objectives.
  Beyond theoretical insights, we conduct the first empirical analysis of random Stable Fixtures instances, uncovering surprising results, such as the impact of capacity functions on the solvability likelihood. Our work not only unifies and extends classical and recent perspectives on stability in non-bipartite stable matching but also establishes new tools, techniques, and directions for advancing the study of stable matchings and their applications.</description>

      <title>Strategic Collusion of LLM Agents: Market Division in Multi-Commodity Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning technologies are seeing increased deployment in real-world market scenarios. In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Approximating One-Sided and Two-Sided Nash Social Welfare With Capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing Nash social welfare, which is the geometric mean of agents' utilities, in two well-known models. The first model involves one-sided preferences, where a set of indivisible items is allocated among a group of agents (commonly studied in fair division). The second model deals with two-sided preferences, where a set of workers and firms, each having numerical valuations for the other side, are matched with each other (commonly studied in matching-under-preferences literature). We study these models under capacity constraints, which restrict the number of items (respectively, workers) that an agent (respectively, a firm) can receive.
  We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems under a broad class of valuations. Specifically, our main results are the following: (a) For any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, a $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the one-sided problem when agents have submodular valuations, and (b) a $1.33$-approximation algorithm for the two-sided problem when the firms have subadditive valuations. The former result provides the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for Nash welfare in the one-sided problem with submodular valuations and capacities, while the latter result improves upon an existing $\sqrt{OPT}$-approximation algorithm for additive valuations. Our result for the two-sided setting also establishes a computational separation between the Nash and utilitarian welfare objectives. We also complement our algorithms with hardness-of-approximation results. Additionally, for the case of additive valuations, we modify the configuration LP of Feng and Li [ICALP 2024] to obtain an $(e^{1/e}+\epsilon)-$ approximation algorithm for weighted two-sided Nash social welfare under capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>A Fair and Optimal Approach to Sequential Healthcare Rationing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the urgent need for fair and effective allocation of scarce resources, from hospital beds to vaccine distribution. In this paper, we study a healthcare rationing problem where identical units of a resource are divided into different categories, and agents are assigned based on priority rankings. % We first introduce a simple and efficient algorithm that satisfies four fundamental axioms critical to practical applications: eligible compliance, non-wastefulness, respect for priorities, and maximum cardinality. This new algorithm is not only conceptually simpler but also computationally faster than the Reverse Rejecting rules proposed in recent work. % We then extend our analysis to a more general sequential setting, where categories can be processed both sequentially and simultaneously. For this broader framework, we introduce a novel algorithm that preserves the four fundamental axioms while achieving additional desirable properties that existing rules fail to satisfy. Furthermore, we prove that when a strict precedence order over categories is imposed, this rule is the unique mechanism that satisfies these properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Best-Response Dynamics in Random Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the convergence behaviour of simultaneous best-response dynamics in random potential games. We provide a theoretical result showing that, for two-player games with sufficiently many actions, the dynamics converge quickly to a cycle of length two. This cycle lies within the intersection of the neighbourhoods of two distinct Nash equilibria. For three players or more, simulations show that the dynamics converge quickly to a Nash equilibrium with high probability. Furthermore, we show that all these results are robust, in the sense that they hold in non-potential games, provided the players' payoffs are sufficiently correlated. We also compare these dynamics to gradient-based learning methods in near-potential games with three players or more, and observe that simultaneous best-response dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium of comparable payoff substantially faster.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Model-Based Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</description>
