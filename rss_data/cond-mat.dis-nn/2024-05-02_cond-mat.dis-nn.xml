      <title>Partially bonded crystals: a pathway to porosity and polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that anisotropic colloids can self-organise into ordered porous monolayers, where the interplay of localised bonding sites, so called patches, with the particle's shape is responsible for driving the systems away from close-packing and towards porosity. Until now it has been assumed that patchy particles have to be fully bonded with their neighbouring particles for crystals to form, and that, if full bonding cannot be achieved due to the choice of patch placement, disordered assemblies will form instead. In contrast, we show that by deliberately displacing the patches such that full bonding is disfavored, a different route to porous crystalline monolayers emerges, where geometric frustration and partial bonding are pivotal in the structure formation process. The resulting dangling bonds lead to the emergence of effectively chiral units which then act as building blocks for energetically equivalent crystal polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization transition in disordered hyperbolic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Anderson localization in disordered tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices. Such lattices are geometries intermediate between ordinary two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which localize at infinitesimal disorder, and Bethe lattices, which localize at strong disorder. Using state-of-the-art computational group theory methods to create large systems, we approximate the thermodynamic limit through appropriate periodic boundary conditions and numerically demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization transition on the $\{8,3\}$ and $\{8,8\}$ lattices. We find unusually large critical disorder strengths, determine critical exponents, and observe a strong finite-size effect in the level statistics.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and scale invariance in topological Anderson insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate disordered-driven transitions between trivial and topological insulator (TI) phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our study primarily focuses on the BHZ model with Anderson disorder, while other standard 2DTI models exhibit equivalent features. The analysis is based on the local Chern marker (LCM), a local quantity that allows for the characterization of topological transitions in finite and disordered systems. Our simulations indicate that disorder-driven trivial to topological insulator transitions are nicely characterized by $\mathcal{C}_0$, the disorder averaged LCM near the central cell of the system. We show that $\mathcal{C}_0$ is characterized by a single-parameter scaling, namely, $\mathcal{C}_0(M, W, L) \equiv \mathcal{C}_0(z)$ with $z = [W^\mu-W_c^\mu(M)]L$, where $M$ is the Dirac mass, $W$ is the disorder strength and $L$ is the system size, while $W_c(M) \propto \sqrt{M}$ and $\mu \approx 2$ stand for the critical disorder strength and critical exponent, respectively. Our numerical results are in agreement with a theoretical prediction based on a first-order Born approximation (1BA) analysis. These observations lead us to speculate that the universal scaling function we have found is rather general for amorphous and disorder-driven topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Density and current statistics in boundary-driven monitored fermionic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system of non-interacting fermions featuring both boundary driving and continuous monitoring of the bulk particle density. Due to the measurements, the expectation values of the local density and current operators are random variables whose average behavior is described by a well studied Lindblad master equation. By means of exact numerical computations, we go beyond the averaged dynamics and study their full probability distribution functions, focusing on the late-time stationary regime. We find that, contrary to the averaged values, the spatial profiles of the median density and current are non-trivial, exhibiting qualitative differences as a function of the monitoring strength. At weak monitoring, the medians are close to the means, displaying diffusive spatial profiles. At strong monitoring, we find that the median density and current develop a domain-wall and single-peak profile, respectively, which are suggestive of a Zeno-like localization in typical quantum trajectories. While we are not able to identify a sharp phase transition as a function of the monitoring rate, our work highlights the usefulness of characterizing typical behavior beyond the averaged values in the context of monitored many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantized thermal and spin transports of dirty planar topological superconductors</title>

Abstract: Nontrivial bulk topological invariants of quantum materials can leave their signatures on charge, thermal and spin transports. In two dimensions, their imprints can be experimentally measured from well-developed multiterminal Hall bar arrangements. Here, we numerically compute the low temperature ($T$) thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$) and zero temperature spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall conductivities, and longitudinal thermal conductance ($G^{th}_{xx}$) of various prominent two-dimensional fully gapped topological superconductors, belonging to distinct Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, namely $p+ip$ (class D), $d+id$ (class C) and $p \pm ip$ (class DIII) paired states, in mesoscopic six-terminal Hall bar setups from the scattering matrix formalism using Kwant. In both clean and weak disorder limits, the time-reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ and $d+id$ pairings show half-quantized and quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ [in units of $\kappa_0=\pi^2 k^2_B T/(3h)$], respectively, while the latter one in addition accommodates a quantized $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ [in units of $\sigma^{sp}_0=\hbar/(8 \pi)$]. By contrast, the time-reversal invariant $p \pm ip$ pairing only displays a quantized $G^{th}_{xx}$ at low $T$ up to a moderate strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses ($\kappa_{xy}$, $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$, and $G^{th}_{xx}$) vanish. Possible material platforms hosting such paired states and manifesting these robust topological thermal and spin responses are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof of the Spherical Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parisi formula for the free energy is among the crown jewels in the theory of spin glasses. We present a simpler proof of the lower bound in the case of the spherical mean-field model. Our method follows the TAP approach developed recently in e.g. (Subag, 2018): we obtain an ultrametric tree of pure states, each with approximately the same free energy as the entire model, which are hierarchically arranged in accordance with the Parisi ansatz. We construct this tree ``layer by layer'' given the minimizer to Parisi's variational problem. On overlap intervals with full RSB, the tree is built by an optimization algorithm due to Subag. On overlap intervals with finite RSB, the tree is constructed by a new truncated second moment argument; a similar argument also characterizes the free energy of the resulting pure states. Notably we do not use the Aizenman--Sims--Starr scheme, and require interpolation bounds only up to the 1RSB level. Our methods also yield results for large deviations of the ground state, including the entire upper tail rate function for all 1RSB models without external field.</description>

      <title>How Deep Networks Learn Sparse and Hierarchical Data: the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding what makes high-dimensional data learnable is a fundamental question in machine learning. On the one hand, it is believed that the success of deep learning lies in its ability to build a hierarchy of representations that become increasingly more abstract with depth, going from simple features like edges to more complex concepts. On the other hand, learning to be insensitive to invariances of the task, such as smooth transformations for image datasets, has been argued to be important for deep networks and it strongly correlates with their performance. In this work, we aim to explain this correlation and unify these two viewpoints. We show that by introducing sparsity to generative hierarchical models of data, the task acquires insensitivity to spatial transformations that are discrete versions of smooth transformations. In particular, we introduce the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model (SRHM), where we observe and rationalize that a hierarchical representation mirroring the hierarchical model is learnt precisely when such insensitivity is learnt, thereby explaining the strong correlation between the latter and performance. Moreover, we quantify how the sample complexity of CNNs learning the SRHM depends on both the sparsity and hierarchical structure of the task.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>
