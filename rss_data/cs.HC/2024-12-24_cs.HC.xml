      <title>Survey Insights on M365 Copilot Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Australia's National Science Agency conducted a six-month trial of M365 Copilot starting in January 2024 as part of an Australian Government initiative. Three hundred licenses were distributed across CSIRO using a persona-based approach to ensure diversity of roles and attributes among participants. As a scientific research organisation with a unique operational context, our objective was to study the use of M365 Copilot on enhancing productivity, efficiency, and creativity as well as overall satisfaction and ethical considerations. This paper presents the results from two surveys, conducted before and after the trial. The results showed mixed outcomes, with participants reporting improved productivity and efficiency in structured tasks such as meeting summaries and email drafting. Gaps were identified in advanced functionalities and integration, which limited Copilot's overall effectiveness. Satisfaction levels were generally positive, but user experiences varied in certain areas. Ethical concerns, particularly around data privacy, became more pronounced post-trial. These findings highlight Copilot's potential and the need for further refinement to meet users' diverse needs.</description>

      <title>Modeling Battery Electric Vehicle Users' Charging Decisions in Scenarios with Both Time-Related and Distance-Related Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most promising alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. However, range anxiety is still a major concern among BEV users or potential users in recent years. The social-psychological factors were found to be associated with range anxiety, but how the charging decisions are affected by range anxiety is still unclear. Thus, in our study, through an online questionnaire issued in mainland China, we collected 230 participants' charging decisions in 60 range-anxiety-inducing scenarios in which both distance-related, and time-related anxiety co-existed. Then, an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach with the Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to model BEV users' charging decisions in these scenarios. To further explore users' decision-making mechanisms, a Bayesian-Network-regression mixed approach was used to model the inner topological structure among the factors influencing users' decisions. We find that both time-related and distance-related factors can affect users' charging decisions, but the influence of waiting time is softer compared to the BEV range. Users' charging decisions can also be moderated by users' psychological states (i.e., range anxiety level and trust in range estimation system), individual differences (i.e., age and personality), and BEV using experience (i.e., driving mileage, display mileage and range estimation cycle of range estimation system), of which, the range anxiety level is more directly related with users' charging decisions. Findings from this study can provide insights into the optimization of charge station distribution and customization of the charging recommendation system.</description>

      <title>Aria-UI: Visual Grounding for GUI Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital agents for automating tasks across different platforms by directly manipulating the GUIs are increasingly important. For these agents, grounding from language instructions to target elements remains a significant challenge due to reliance on HTML or AXTree inputs. In this paper, we introduce Aria-UI, a large multimodal model specifically designed for GUI grounding. Aria-UI adopts a pure-vision approach, eschewing reliance on auxiliary inputs. To adapt to heterogeneous planning instructions, we propose a scalable data pipeline that synthesizes diverse and high-quality instruction samples for grounding. To handle dynamic contexts in task performing, Aria-UI incorporates textual and text-image interleaved action histories, enabling robust context-aware reasoning for grounding. Aria-UI sets new state-of-the-art results across offline and online agent benchmarks, outperforming both vision-only and AXTree-reliant baselines. We release all training data and model checkpoints to foster further research at https://ariaui.github.io.</description>

      <title>XR for All: Understanding Developer Perspectives on Accessibility Integration in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As immersive technologies enable unique, multimodal interaction methods, developers must also use tailored methods to support user accessibility, distinct from traditional software practices. Therefore, we interviewed 25 industry extended reality (XR) developers, including freelancers, startups, midsize, and big tech companies about their motivations, techniques, barriers, and attitudes towards incorporating accessibility features in their XR apps. Our study revealed a variety of challenges, including conflicting priorities between application and platform developers regarding accessibility infrastructure; startups rapid development culture prohibiting accessible development; and the lack of accessible interaction design considerations at the ideation, design, and early prototyping stages. As a comprehensive set of XR accessibility guidelines has yet to be established, we also compiled and evaluated a set of accessibility guidelines for 3D virtual worlds and addressed their limitations when applied to XR. Finally, we inform the creation of effective support methods for industry developers.</description>

      <title>Designing LLM-Based Voice-Control for Surgical Augmented Reality Navigation System in Pancreatic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are gaining recognition for their potential to transform surgical navigation systems. As these technologies evolve, selecting the right interaction method to control the system becomes crucial. Our work introduces a voice-controlled user interface (VCUI) for surgical AR assistance systems (ARAS), designed for pancreatic surgery, that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs). Employing a mixed-method research approach, we assessed the usability of our LLM-based design in both simulated surgical tasks and during pancreatic surgeries, comparing its performance against conventional VCUI for surgical ARAS using speech commands. Our findings demonstrated the usability of our proposed LLM-based VCUI, yielding a significantly lower task completion time and cognitive workload compared to speech commands. Additionally, qualitative insights from interviews with surgeons aligned with the quantitative data, revealing a strong preference for the LLM-based VCUI. Surgeons emphasized its intuitiveness and highlighted the potential of LLM-based VCUI in expediting decision-making in surgical environments.</description>

      <title>Apples to Apples: Establishing Comparability in Knowledge Generation Tasks Involving Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph construction (KGC) from (semi-)structured data is challenging, and facilitating user involvement is an issue frequently brought up within this community. We cannot deny the progress we have made with respect to (declarative) knowledge generation languages and tools to help build such mappings. However, it is surprising that no two studies report on similar protocols. This heterogeneity does not allow for a comparison of KGC languages, techniques, and tools. This paper first analyses the various studies that report on studies involving users to identify the points of comparison. These gaps include a lack of systematic consistency in task design, participant selection, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, there needs to be a systematic way of analyzing the data and reporting the findings, which is also lacking. We thus propose and introduce a user protocol for KGC designed to address this challenge. Where possible, we draw and take elements from the literature we deem fit for such a protocol. The protocol, as such, allows for the comparison of languages and techniques for the RDF Mapping Languages core functionality, which is covered by most of the other state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We also propose how the protocol can be amended to compare extensions (of RML). This protocol provides an important step towards a more comparable evaluation of KGC user studies.</description>

      <title>SoK: Usability Studies in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a pivotal approach for safeguarding individual privacy in data analysis, yet its practical adoption is often hindered by challenges in usability in implementation and communication of the privacy protection levels. This paper presents a comprehensive systematization of existing research on the usability of and communication about DP, synthesizing insights from studies on both the practical use of DP tools and strategies for conveying DP parameters that determine the privacy protection levels such as epsilon. By reviewing and analyzing these studies, we identify core usability challenges, best practices, and critical gaps in current DP tools that affect adoption across diverse user groups, including developers, data analysts, and non-technical stakeholders. Our analysis highlights actionable insights and pathways for future research that emphasizes user-centered design and clear communication, fostering the development of more accessible DP tools that meet practical needs and support broader adoption.</description>

      <title>Adaptive User Interface Generation Through Reinforcement Learning: A Data-Driven Approach to Personalization and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an adaptive user interface generation technology, emphasizing the role of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in optimizing user experience. By focusing on enhancing the interaction between users and intelligent systems, this approach aims to automatically adjust interface layouts and configurations based on user feedback, streamlining the design process. Traditional interface design involves significant manual effort and struggles to meet the evolving personalized needs of users. Our proposed system integrates adaptive interface generation with reinforcement learning and intelligent feedback mechanisms to dynamically adjust the user interface, better accommodating individual usage patterns. In the experiment, the OpenAI CLIP Interactions dataset was utilized to verify the adaptability of the proposed method, using click-through rate (CTR) and user retention rate (RR) as evaluation metrics. The findings highlight the system's ability to deliver flexible and personalized interface solutions, providing a novel and effective approach for user interaction design and ultimately enhancing HCI through continuous learning and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Fatigue Monitoring Using Wearables and AI: Trends, Challenges, and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring fatigue is essential for improving safety, particularly for people who work long shifts or in high-demand workplaces. The development of wearable technologies, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, has made it possible to continuously analyze physiological signals in real-time to determine a person level of exhaustion. This has allowed for timely insights into preventing hazards associated with fatigue. This review focuses on wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) integration for tiredness detection, adhering to the PRISMA principles. Studies that used signal processing methods to extract pertinent aspects from physiological data, such as ECG, EMG, and EEG, among others, were analyzed as part of the systematic review process. Then, to find patterns of weariness and indicators of impending fatigue, these features were examined using machine learning and deep learning models. It was demonstrated that wearable technology and cutting-edge AI methods could accurately identify weariness through multi-modal data analysis. By merging data from several sources, information fusion techniques enhanced the precision and dependability of fatigue evaluation. Significant developments in AI-driven signal analysis were noted in the assessment, which should improve real-time fatigue monitoring while requiring less interference. Wearable solutions powered by AI and multi-source data fusion present a strong option for real-time tiredness monitoring in the workplace and other crucial environments. These developments open the door for more improvements in this field and offer useful tools for enhancing safety and reducing fatigue-related hazards.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Trauma in Qualitative Research Infrastructure: Roles for Machine Assistance and Trauma-Informed Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers increasingly look to understand experiences of pain, harm, and marginalization via qualitative analysis. Such work is needed to understand and address social ills, but poses risks to researchers' well-being: sifting through volumes of data on painful human experiences risks incurring traumatic exposure in the researcher. In this paper, we explore how the principles of trauma-informed computing (TIC) can be applied to reimagine healthier tools and workflows for qualitative analysis. We apply TIC to create a design provocation called TIQA, a system for qualitative coding that leverages language modeling, semantic search, and recommendation systems to measure and mitigate an analyst's exposure to concepts they find traumatic. Through a formative study of TIQA with 15 participants, we illuminate the complexities of enacting TIC in qualitative knowledge infrastructure, and potential roles for machine assistance in mitigating researchers' trauma. To assist scholars in translating the high-level principles of TIC into sociotechnical system design, we argue for: (a) a conceptual shift from safety as exposure reduction towards safety as enablement; and (b) renewed attention to evaluating the trauma-informedness of design processes, in tandem with the outcomes of designed objects on users' well-being.</description>

      <title>An Interaction Design Toolkit for Physical Task Guidance with Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical skill acquisition, from sports techniques to surgical procedures, requires instruction and feedback. In the absence of a human expert, Physical Task Guidance (PTG) systems can offer a promising alternative. These systems integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Mixed Reality (MR) to provide realtime feedback and guidance as users practice and learn skills using physical tools and objects. However, designing PTG systems presents challenges beyond engineering complexities. The intricate interplay between users, AI, MR interfaces, and the physical environment creates unique interaction design hurdles. To address these challenges, we present an interaction design toolkit derived from our analysis of PTG prototypes developed by eight student teams during a 10-week-long graduate course. The toolkit comprises Design Considerations, Design Patterns, and an Interaction Canvas. Our evaluation suggests that the toolkit can serve as a valuable resource for practitioners designing PTG systems and researchers developing new tools for human-AI interaction design.</description>

      <title>Modular Conversational Agents for Surveys and Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys and interviews (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured) are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by large language models (LLMs). However, as public investments and policies on infrastructure and services often involve substantial public stakes and environmental risks, there is a need for a rigorous, transparent, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient development framework tailored for such major decision-making processes. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resultant parameterized process for designing conversational agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic in the proposed approach. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) transportation expert consultation about future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript post-processing. The results show the effectiveness of this modular approach and how it addresses key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns, setting the stage for the next-generation surveys and interviews.</description>

      <title>ChromaGazer: Unobtrusive Visual Modulation using Imperceptible Color Vibration for Visual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual guidance (VG) is critical for directing user attention in virtual and augmented reality applications. However, conventional methods using explicit visual annotations can obstruct visibility and increase cognitive load. To address this, we propose an unobtrusive VG technique based on color vibration, a phenomenon in which rapidly alternating colors at frequencies above 25 Hz are perceived as a single intermediate color. We hypothesize that an intermediate perceptual state exists between complete color fusion and perceptual flicker, where colors appear subtly different from a uniform color without conscious perception of flicker. To investigate this, we conducted two experiments. First, we determined the thresholds between complete fusion, the intermediate state, and perceptual flicker by varying the amplitude of color vibration pairs in a user study. Second, we applied these threshold parameters to modulate regions in natural images and evaluated their effectiveness in guiding users' gaze using eye-tracking data. Our results show that color vibration can subtly guide gaze while minimizing cognitive load, providing a novel approach for unobtrusive VG in VR and AR applications.</description>

      <title>A Room to Roam: Reset Prediction Based on Physical Object Placement for Redirected Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Redirected Walking (RDW), resets are an overt method that explicitly interrupts users, and they should be avoided to provide a quality user experience. The number of resets depends on the configuration of the physical environment; thus, inappropriate object placement can lead to frequent resets, causing motion sickness and degrading presence. However, estimating the number of resets based on the physical layout is challenging. It is difficult to measure reset frequency with real users repeatedly testing different layouts, and virtual simulations offer limited real-time verification. As a result, while rearranging objects can reduce resets, users have not been able to fully take advantage of this opportunity, highlighting the need for rapid assessment of object placement. To address this, in Study 1, we collected simulation data and analyzed the average number of resets for various object placements. In study 2, we developed a system that allows users to evaluate reset frequency using a real-time placement interface powered by the first learning-based reset prediction model. Our model predicts resets from top-down views of the physical space, leveraging a Vision Transformer architecture. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of $23.88$. We visualized the model's attention scores using heatmaps to analyze the regions of focus during prediction. Through the interface, users can reorganize furniture while instantly observing the change in the predicted number of resets, thus improving their interior for a better RDW experience with fewer resets.</description>

Abstract: Due to the still relatively low number of users, acquiring large-scale and multidimensional virtual reality datasets remains a significant challenge. Consequently, VR datasets comparable in size to state-of-the-art collections in natural language processing or computer vision are rare or absent. However, the availability of such datasets could unlock groundbreaking advancements in deep-learning, psychological modeling, and data analysis in the context of VR. In this paper, we present a versatile data collection toolkit designed to facilitate the capturing of extensive VR datasets. Our toolkit seamlessly integrates with any device, either directly via OpenXR or through the use of a virtual device. Additionally, we introduce a robust data collection pipeline that emphasizes ethical practices (e.g., ensuring data protection and regulation) and ensures a standardized, reproducible methodology.</description>

      <title>Gummy's Way Out -- a Tangible Interactive Narrative with Food and the Diegetic Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in designing playful interactions with food, but food based tangible interactive narratives have received less attention. We introduce Gummy's Way Out, an interactive tangible narrative experience where interactors eat a gummy bear and help him find his way out of their bodies by eating various food items. By consuming different things, the interactor either helps or hinders the gummy bear's journey through an imagined Diegetic body that overlaps with their own. Interactors are endowed with the gummy bear's well-being and are also encouraged to reflect on how their actions can impact their Lived body. We present preliminary results of a user study and design considerations on how to design for the diegetic body in interactive food based narrative experiences. We recommend leveraging the sensory and emotional properties of food to create a visceral narrative experience.</description>

      <title>Towards Human Haptic Gesture Interpretation for Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01959v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical human-robot interactions (pHRI) are less efficient and communicative than human-human interactions, and a key reason is a lack of informative sense of touch in robotic systems. Interpreting human touch gestures is a nuanced, challenging task with extreme gaps between human and robot capability. Among prior works that demonstrate human touch recognition capability, differences in sensors, gesture classes, feature sets, and classification algorithms yield a conglomerate of non-transferable results and a glaring lack of a standard. To address this gap, this work presents 1) four proposed touch gesture classes that cover an important subset of the gesture characteristics identified in the literature, 2) the collection of an extensive force dataset on a common pHRI robotic arm with only its internal wrist force-torque sensor, and 3) an exhaustive performance comparison of combinations of feature sets and classification algorithms on this dataset. We demonstrate high classification accuracies among our proposed gesture definitions on a test set, emphasizing that neural net-work classifiers on the raw data outperform other combinations of feature sets and algorithms.

      <title>Promoting AI Literacy in Higher Education: Evaluating the IEC-V1 Chatbot for Personalized Learning and Educational Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unequal distribution of educational opportunities carries the risk of having a long-term negative impact on general social peace, a country's economy and basic democratic structures. In contrast to this observable development is the rapid technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Progress makes it possible to solve various problems in the field of education as well. In order to effectively exploit the advantages that arise from the use of AI, prospective teacher training students need appropriate AI skills, which must already be taught during their studies. In a first step, the added value of this technology will be demonstrated using a concrete example. This article is therefore about conducting an exploratory pilot study to test the Individual Educational Chatbot (IEC-V1) prototype, in which the levels can be individually determined in order to generate appropriate answers depending on the requirements. The results show that this is an important function for prospective teachers, and that there is great interest in taking a closer look at this technology in order to be able to better support learners in the future. The data shows that experience has already been gained with chatbots, but that there is still room for improvement. It also shows that IEC-V1 is already working well. The knowledge gained will be used for the further development of the prototype to further improve the usability of the chatbot. Overall, it is shown that useful AI applications can be effectively integrated into learning situations even without proprietary systems and that important data protection requirements can be complied with.</description>

      <title>LABIIUM: AI-Enhanced Zero-configuration Measurement Automation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</description>

      <title>Agents Are Not Enough</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the midst of the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various aspects of our lives, agents are experiencing a resurgence. These autonomous programs that act on behalf of humans are neither new nor exclusive to the mainstream AI movement. By exploring past incarnations of agents, we can understand what has been done previously, what worked, and more importantly, what did not pan out and why. This understanding lets us to examine what distinguishes the current focus on agents. While generative AI is appealing, this technology alone is insufficient to make new generations of agents more successful. To make the current wave of agents effective and sustainable, we envision an ecosystem that includes not only agents but also Sims, which represent user preferences and behaviors, as well as Assistants, which directly interact with the user and coordinate the execution of user tasks with the help of the agents.</description>

      <title>Color-Name Aware Optimization to Enhance the Perception of Transparent Overlapped Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency is commonly utilized in visualizations to overlay color-coded histograms or sets, thereby facilitating the visual comparison of categorical data. However, these charts often suffer from significant overlap between objects, resulting in substantial color interactions. Existing color blending models struggle in these scenarios, frequently leading to ambiguous color mappings and the introduction of false colors. To address these challenges, we propose an automated approach for generating optimal color encodings to enhance the perception of translucent charts. Our method harnesses color nameability to maximize the association between composite colors and their respective class labels. We introduce a color-name aware (CNA) optimization framework that generates maximally coherent color assignments and transparency settings while ensuring perceptual discriminability for all segments in the visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through crowdsourced experiments with composite histograms, showing how our technique can significantly outperform both standard and visualization-specific color blending models. Furthermore, we illustrate how our approach can be generalized to other visualizations, including parallel coordinates and Venn diagrams. We provide an open-source implementation of our technique as a web-based tool.</description>

      <title>Web Privacy based on Contextual Integrity: Measuring the Collapse of Online Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of social contexts has been amplified by digital infrastructures but surprisingly received insufficient attention from Web privacy scholars. Users are persistently identified within and across distinct web contexts, in varying degrees, through and by different websites and trackers, losing the ability to maintain a fragmented identity. To systematically evaluate this structural privacy harm we operationalize the theory of Privacy as Contextual Integrity and measure persistent user identification within and between distinct Web contexts. We crawl the top-700 popular websites across the contexts of health, finance, news &amp; media, LGBTQ, eCommerce, adult, and education websites, for 27 days, to learn how persistent browser identification via third-party cookies and JavaScript fingerprinting is diffused within and between web contexts. Past work measured Web tracking in bulk, highlighting the volume of trackers and tracking techniques. These measurements miss a crucial privacy implication of Web tracking - the collapse of online contexts. Our findings reveal how persistent browser identification varies between and within contexts, diffusing user IDs to different distances, contrasting known tracking distributions across websites, and conducted as a joint or separate effort via cookie IDs and JS fingerprinting. Our network analysis can inform the construction of browser storage containers to protect users against real-time context collapse. This is a first modest step in measuring Web privacy as contextual integrity, opening new avenues for contextual Web privacy research.</description>

      <title>Autoware.Flex: Human-Instructed Dynamically Reconfigurable Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) independently make driving decisions, but they face two significant limitations. First, in complex scenarios, ADS may misinterpret the environment and make inappropriate driving decisions. Second, these systems are unable to incorporate human driving preferences in their decision-making processes. This paper proposes Autoware.Flex, a novel ADS system that incorporates human input into the driving process, allowing users to guide the ADS in making more appropriate decisions and ensuring their preferences are satisfied. Achieving this needs to address two key challenges: (1) translating human instructions, expressed in natural language, into a format the ADS can understand, and (2) ensuring these instructions are executed safely and consistently within the ADS' s decision-making framework. For the first challenge, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) assisted by an ADS-specialized knowledge base to enhance domain-specific translation. For the second challenge, we design a validation mechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent driving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world autonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware.Flex effectively interprets human instructions and executes them safely.</description>

      <title>MetaScientist: A Human-AI Synergistic Framework for Automated Mechanical Metamaterial Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel mechanical metamaterials, whose properties are dominated by their engineered structures rather than chemical composition, is a knowledge-intensive and resource-demanding process. To accelerate the design of novel metamaterials, we present MetaScientist, a human-in-the-loop system that integrates advanced AI capabilities with expert oversight with two primary phases: (1) hypothesis generation, where the system performs complex reasoning to generate novel and scientifically sound hypotheses, supported with domain-specific foundation models and inductive biases retrieved from existing literature; (2) 3D structure synthesis, where a 3D structure is synthesized with a novel 3D diffusion model based on the textual hypothesis and refined it with a LLM-based refinement model to achieve better structure properties. At each phase, domain experts iteratively validate the system outputs, and provide feedback and supplementary materials to ensure the alignment of the outputs with scientific principles and human preferences. Through extensive evaluation from human scientists, MetaScientist is able to deliver novel and valid mechanical metamaterial designs that have the potential to be highly impactful in the metamaterial field.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Mind of an Instruction-based Image Editing using SMILE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Instruct-based Image Editing models for generating high-quality images, they are known as black boxes and a significant barrier to transparency and user trust. To solve this issue, we introduce SMILE (Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations), a novel model-agnostic for localized interpretability that provides a visual heatmap to clarify the textual elements' influence on image-generating models. We applied our method to various Instruction-based Image Editing models like Pix2Pix, Image2Image-turbo and Diffusers-Inpaint and showed how our model can improve interpretability and reliability. Also, we use stability, accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics to evaluate our method. These findings indicate the exciting potential of model-agnostic interpretability for reliability and trustworthiness in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving while encouraging additional investigation into the significance of interpretability in enhancing dependable image editing models.</description>

      <title>VerSe: Integrating Multiple Queries as Prompts for Versatile Cardiac MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the advances in learning-based image segmentation approach, the accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a critical challenge. While existing automatic segmentation methods have shown promise, they still require extensive manual corrections of the segmentation results by human experts, particularly in complex regions such as the basal and apical parts of the heart. Recent efforts have been made on developing interactive image segmentation methods that enable human-in-the-loop learning. However, they are semi-automatic and inefficient, due to their reliance on click-based prompts, especially for 3D cardiac MRI volumes. To address these limitations, we propose VerSe, a Versatile Segmentation framework to unify automatic and interactive segmentation through mutiple queries. Our key innovation lies in the joint learning of object and click queries as prompts for a shared segmentation backbone. VerSe supports both fully automatic segmentation, through object queries, and interactive mask refinement, by providing click queries when needed. With the proposed integrated prompting scheme, VerSe demonstrates significant improvement in performance and efficiency over existing methods, on both cardiac MRI and out-of-distribution medical imaging datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/bangwayne/Verse.</description>

      <title>Ethics and Technical Aspects of Generative AI Models in Digital Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI models like GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 are reshaping digital content creation, offering industries tools to generate diverse and sophisticated text and images with remarkable creativity and efficiency. This paper examines both the capabilities and challenges of these models within creative workflows. While they deliver high performance in generating content with creativity, diversity, and technical precision, they also raise significant ethical concerns. Our study addresses two key research questions: (a) how these models perform in terms of creativity, diversity, accuracy, and computational efficiency, and (b) the ethical risks they present, particularly concerning bias, authenticity, and potential misuse. Through a structured series of experiments, we analyze their technical performance and assess the ethical implications of their outputs, revealing that although generative models enhance creative processes, they often reflect biases from their training data and carry ethical vulnerabilities that require careful oversight. This research proposes ethical guidelines to support responsible AI integration into industry practices, fostering a balance between innovation and ethical integrity.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of College-level Data Visualization Courses, and the Benefits of Incorporating Statistical Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data visualization is a core part of statistical practice and is ubiquitous in many fields. Although there are numerous books on data visualization, instructors in statistics and data science may be unsure how to teach data visualization, because it is such a broad discipline. To give guidance on teaching data visualization from a statistical perspective, we make two contributions. First, we conduct a survey of data visualization courses at top colleges and universities in the United States, in order to understand the landscape of data visualization courses. We find that most courses are not taught by statistics and data science departments and do not focus on statistical topics, especially those related to inference. Instead, most courses focus on visual storytelling, aesthetic design, dashboard design, and other topics specialized for other disciplines. Second, we outline three teaching principles for incorporating statistical inference in data visualization courses, and provide several examples that demonstrate how instructors can follow these principles. The dataset from our survey allows others to explore the diversity of data visualization courses, and our teaching principles give guidance to instructors and departments who want to encourage statistical thinking via data visualization. In this way, statistics-related departments can provide a valuable perspective on data visualization that is unique to current course offerings.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad, and the (Un)Usable: A Rapid Literature Review on Privacy as Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy and security are central to the design of information systems endowed with sound data protection and cyber resilience capabilities. Still, developers often struggle to incorporate these properties into software projects as they either lack proper cybersecurity training or do not consider them a priority. Prior work has tried to support privacy and security engineering activities through threat modeling methods for scrutinizing flaws in system architectures. Moreover, several techniques for the automatic identification of vulnerabilities and the generation of secure code implementations have also been proposed in the current literature. Conversely, such as-code approaches seem under-investigated in the privacy domain, with little work elaborating on (i) the automatic detection of privacy properties in source code or (ii) the generation of privacy-friendly code. In this work, we seek to characterize the current research landscape of Privacy as Code (PaC) methods and tools by conducting a rapid literature review. Our results suggest that PaC research is in its infancy, especially regarding the performance evaluation and usability assessment of the existing approaches. Based on these findings, we outline and discuss prospective research directions concerning empirical studies with software practitioners, the curation of benchmark datasets, and the role of generative AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Interact with me: Joint Egocentric Forecasting of Intent to Interact, Attitude and Social Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For efficient human-agent interaction, an agent should proactively recognize their target user and prepare for upcoming interactions. We formulate this challenging problem as the novel task of jointly forecasting a person's intent to interact with the agent, their attitude towards the agent and the action they will perform, from the agent's (egocentric) perspective. So we propose \emph{SocialEgoNet} - a graph-based spatiotemporal framework that exploits task dependencies through a hierarchical multitask learning approach. SocialEgoNet uses whole-body skeletons (keypoints from face, hands and body) extracted from only 1 second of video input for high inference speed. For evaluation, we augment an existing egocentric human-agent interaction dataset with new class labels and bounding box annotations. Extensive experiments on this augmented dataset, named JPL-Social, demonstrate \emph{real-time} inference and superior performance (average accuracy across all tasks: 83.15\%) of our model outperforming several competitive baselines. The additional annotations and code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamics of Sub-Millisecond Electroadhesive Engagement and Release Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroadhesion is an electrically controllable switchable adhesive commonly used in soft robots and haptic user interfaces. It can form strong bonds to a wide variety of surfaces at low power consumption. However, electroadhesive clutches in the literature engage to and release from substrates several orders of magnitude slower than a traditional electrostatic model would predict, limiting their usefulness in high-bandwidth applications. We develop a novel electromechanical model for electroadhesion, factoring in polarization dynamics and contact mechanics between the dielectric and substrate. We show in simulation and experimentally how different design parameters affect the engagement and release times of electroadhesive clutches to metallic substrates. In particular, we find that higher drive frequencies and narrower substrate aspect ratios enable significantly faster dynamics. We demonstrate designs with engagement times under 15 us and release times as low as 875 us, which are 10x and 17.1x faster, respectively, than the best times found in prior literature.</description>

      <title>Lies, Damned Lies, and Distributional Language Statistics: Persuasion and Deception with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content that is as persuasive as human-written text and appear capable of selectively producing deceptive outputs. These capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse and unintended consequences as these systems become more widely deployed. This review synthesizes recent empirical work examining LLMs' capacity and proclivity for persuasion and deception, analyzes theoretical risks that could arise from these capabilities, and evaluates proposed mitigations. While current persuasive effects are relatively small, various mechanisms could increase their impact, including fine-tuning, multimodality, and social factors. We outline key open questions for future research, including how persuasive AI systems might become, whether truth enjoys an inherent advantage over falsehoods, and how effective different mitigation strategies may be in practice.</description>

      <title>"From Unseen Needs to Classroom Solutions": Exploring AI Literacy Challenges &amp; Opportunities with Project-based Learning Toolkit in K-12 Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to various fields, there is a growing need to equip K-12 students with AI literacy skills that extend beyond computer science. This paper explores the integration of a Project-Based Learning (PBL) AI toolkit into diverse subject areas, aimed at helping educators teach AI concepts more effectively. Through interviews and co-design sessions with K-12 teachers, we examined current AI literacy levels and how teachers adapt AI tools like the AI Art Lab, AI Music Studio, and AI Chatbot into their course designs. While teachers appreciated the potential of AI tools to foster creativity and critical thinking, they also expressed concerns about the accuracy, trustworthiness, and ethical implications of AI-generated content. Our findings reveal the challenges teachers face, including limited resources, varying student and instructor skill levels, and the need for scalable, adaptable AI tools. This research contributes insights that can inform the development of AI curricula tailored to diverse educational contexts.</description>

      <title>AV-EmoDialog: Chat with Audio-Visual Users Leveraging Emotional Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human communication, both verbal and non-verbal cues play a crucial role in conveying emotions, intentions, and meaning beyond words alone. These non-linguistic information, such as facial expressions, eye contact, voice tone, and pitch, are fundamental elements of effective interactions, enriching conversations by adding emotional and contextual depth. Recognizing the importance of non-linguistic content in communication, we present AV-EmoDialog, a dialogue system designed to exploit verbal and non-verbal information from users' audio-visual inputs to generate more responsive and empathetic interactions. AV-EmoDialog systematically exploits the emotional cues in audio-visual dialogues; extracting speech content and emotional tones from speech, analyzing fine-grained facial expressions from visuals, and integrating these cues to generate emotionally aware responses in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments, we validate that the proposed AV-EmoDialog outperforms existing multimodal LLMs in generating not only emotionally appropriate but also contextually appropriate responses.</description>

      <title>An HCAI Methodological Framework (HCAI-MF): Putting It Into Action to Enable Human-Centered AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) is a design philosophy that prioritizes humans in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, aiming to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its negative impacts. Despite its growing prominence in literature, the lack of methodological guidance for its implementation poses challenges to HCAI practice. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive HCAI methodological framework (HCAI-MF) comprising five key components: HCAI requirement hierarchy, approach and method taxonomy, process, interdisciplinary collaboration approach, and multi-level design paradigms. A case study demonstrates HCAI-MF's practical implications, while the paper also analyzes implementation challenges. Actionable recommendations and a "three-layer" HCAI implementation strategy are provided to address these challenges and guide future evolution of HCAI-MF. HCAI-MF is presented as a systematic and executable methodology capable of overcoming current gaps, enabling effective design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, and advancing HCAI practice.</description>

      <title>InsightLens: Augmenting LLM-Powered Data Analysis with Interactive Insight Management and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the capabilities of natural language interfaces (NLIs) for data analysis. LLMs can perform multi-step and complex reasoning to generate data insights based on users' analytic intents. However, these insights often entangle with an abundance of contexts in analytic conversations such as code, visualizations, and natural language explanations. This hinders efficient recording, organization, and navigation of insights within the current chat-based LLM interfaces. In this paper, we first conduct a formative study with eight data analysts to understand their general workflow and pain points of insight management during LLM-powered data analysis. Accordingly, we introduce InsightLens, an interactive system to overcome such challenges. Built upon an LLM-agent-based framework that automates insight recording and organization along with the analysis process, InsightLens visualizes the complex conversational contexts from multiple aspects to facilitate insight navigation. A user study with twelve data analysts demonstrates the effectiveness of InsightLens, showing that it significantly reduces users' manual and cognitive effort without disrupting their conversational data analysis workflow, leading to a more efficient analysis experience.</description>

      <title>VisTR: Visualizations as Representations for Time-series Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series table reasoning interprets temporal patterns and relationships in data to answer user queries. Despite recent advancements leveraging large language models (LLMs), existing methods often struggle with pattern recognition, context drift in long time-series data, and the lack of visual-based reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose VisTR, a framework that places visualizations at the core of the reasoning process. Specifically, VisTR leverages visualizations as representations to bridge raw time-series data and human cognitive processes. By transforming tables into fixed-size visualization references, it captures key trends, anomalies, and temporal relationships, facilitating intuitive and interpretable reasoning. These visualizations are aligned with user input, i.e., charts, text, and sketches, through a fine-tuned multimodal LLM, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. To handle large-scale data, VisTR integrates pruning and indexing mechanisms for scalable and efficient retrieval. Finally, an interactive visualization interface supports seamless multimodal exploration, enabling users to interact with data through both textual and visual modalities. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of VisTR in aligning multimodal inputs and improving reasoning accuracy. Case studies further illustrate its applicability to various time-series reasoning and exploration tasks.</description>

      <title>"The Data Says Otherwise"-Towards Automated Fact-checking and Communication of Data Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fact-checking data claims requires data evidence retrieval and analysis, which can become tedious and intractable when done manually. This work presents Aletheia, an automated fact-checking prototype designed to facilitate data claims verification and enhance data evidence communication. For verification, we utilize a pre-trained LLM to parse the semantics for evidence retrieval. To effectively communicate the data evidence, we design representations in two forms: data tables and visualizations, tailored to various data fact types. Additionally, we design interactions that showcase a real-world application of these techniques. We evaluate the performance of two core NLP tasks with a curated dataset comprising 400 data claims and compare the two representation forms regarding viewers' assessment time, confidence, and preference via a user study with 20 participants. The evaluation offers insights into the feasibility and bottlenecks of using LLMs for data fact-checking tasks, potential advantages and disadvantages of using visualizations over data tables, and design recommendations for presenting data evidence.</description>

      <title>Predicting Quality of Video Gaming Experience Using Global-Scale Telemetry Data and Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frames Per Second (FPS) significantly affects the gaming experience. Providing players with accurate FPS estimates prior to purchase benefits both players and game developers. However, we have a limited understanding of how to predict a game's FPS performance on a specific device. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of factors that may affect game FPS on a global-scale dataset to identify the determinants of FPS. This includes player-side and game-side characteristics, as well as country-level socio-economic statistics. Furthermore, recognizing that accurate FPS predictions require extensive user data, which raises privacy concerns, we propose a federated learning-based model to ensure user privacy. Each player and game is assigned a unique learnable knowledge kernel that gradually extracts latent features for improved accuracy. We also introduce a novel training and prediction scheme that allows these kernels to be dynamically plug-and-play, effectively addressing cold start issues. To train this model with minimal bias, we collected a large telemetry dataset from 224 countries and regions, 100,000 users, and 835 games. Our model achieved a mean Wasserstein distance of 0.469 between predicted and ground truth FPS distributions, outperforming all baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aging society urgently requires scalable methods to monitor cognitive decline and identify social and psychological factors indicative of dementia risk in older adults. Our machine learning (ML) models captured facial, acoustic, linguistic, and cardiovascular features from 39 individuals with normal cognition or Mild Cognitive Impairment derived from remote video conversations and classified cognitive status, social isolation, neuroticism, and psychological well-being. Our model could distinguish Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) of 0.5 (vs. 0) with 0.78 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), social isolation with 0.75 AUC, neuroticism with 0.71 AUC, and negative affect scales with 0.79 AUC. Recent advances in machine learning offer new opportunities to remotely detect cognitive impairment and assess associated factors, such as neuroticism and psychological well-being. Our experiment showed that speech and language patterns were more useful for quantifying cognitive impairment, whereas facial expression and cardiovascular patterns using photoplethysmography (PPG) were more useful for quantifying personality and psychological well-being.</description>

      <title>AttributionScanner: A Visual Analytics System for Model Validation with Metadata-Free Slice Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data slice finding is an emerging technique for validating machine learning (ML) models by identifying and analyzing subgroups in a dataset that exhibit poor performance, often characterized by distinct feature sets or descriptive metadata. However, in the context of validating vision models involving unstructured image data, this approach faces significant challenges, including the laborious and costly requirement for additional metadata and the complex task of interpreting the root causes of underperformance. To address these challenges, we introduce AttributionScanner, an innovative human-in-the-loop Visual Analytics (VA) system, designed for metadata-free data slice finding. Our system identifies interpretable data slices that involve common model behaviors and visualizes these patterns through an Attribution Mosaic design. Our interactive interface provides straightforward guidance for users to detect, interpret, and annotate predominant model issues, such as spurious correlations (model biases) and mislabeled data, with minimal effort. Additionally, it employs a cutting-edge model regularization technique to mitigate the detected issues and enhance the model's performance. The efficacy of AttributionScanner is demonstrated through use cases involving two benchmark datasets, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations showcasing its substantial effectiveness in vision model validation, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time flood forecasting is vital for effective emergency responses, but bridging the gap between complex numerical models and practical decision-making remains challenging. Decision-makers often rely on experts, while the public struggles to interpret flood risk information. To address this, we developed a customized AI Assistant powered by GPT-4. This tool enhances communication between decision-makers, the public, and forecasters, requiring no specialized knowledge. The framework leverages GPT-4's advanced natural language capabilities to search flood alerts, answer inquiries, and integrate real-time warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It simplifies complex flood zone information into actionable advice. The prototype was evaluated on relevance, error resilience, and contextual understanding, with performance compared across different GPT models. This research advances flood risk management by making critical information more accessible and engaging, demonstrating the potential of AI tools like GPT-4 in addressing social and environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>PixelsDB: Serverless and NL-Aided Data Analytics with Flexible Service Levels and Prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serverless query processing has become increasingly popular due to its advantages, including automated resource management, high elasticity, and pay-as-you-go pricing. For users who are not system experts, serverless query processing greatly reduces the cost of owning a data analytic system. However, it is still a significant challenge for non-expert users to transform their complex and evolving data analytic needs into proper SQL queries and select a serverless query service that delivers satisfactory performance and price for each type of query.
  This paper presents PixelsDB, an open-source data analytic system that allows users who lack system or SQL expertise to explore data efficiently. It allows users to generate and debug SQL queries using a natural language interface powered by fine-tuned language models. The queries are then executed by a serverless query engine that offers varying prices for different performance service levels (SLAs). The performance SLAs are natively supported by dedicated architecture design and heterogeneous resource scheduling that can apply cost-efficient resources to process non-urgent queries. We demonstrate that the combination of a serverless paradigm, a natural-language-aided interface, and flexible SLAs and prices will substantially improve the usability of cloud data analytic systems.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Generating Self-Correction Guideline for In-Context Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhances the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. All agent interactions are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MAGIC.</description>

      <title>Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</description>

      <title>GarmentLab: A Unified Simulation and Benchmark for Garment Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating garments and fabrics has long been a critical endeavor in the development of home-assistant robots. However, due to complex dynamics and topological structures, garment manipulations pose significant challenges. Recent successes in reinforcement learning and vision-based methods offer promising avenues for learning garment manipulation. Nevertheless, these approaches are severely constrained by current benchmarks, which offer limited diversity of tasks and unrealistic simulation behavior. Therefore, we present GarmentLab, a content-rich benchmark and realistic simulation designed for deformable object and garment manipulation. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse range of garment types, robotic systems and manipulators. The abundant tasks in the benchmark further explores of the interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and human body. Moreover, by incorporating multiple simulation methods such as FEM and PBD, along with our proposed sim-to-real algorithms and real-world benchmark, we aim to significantly narrow the sim-to-real gap. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision methods, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning approaches on these tasks, highlighting the challenges faced by current algorithms, notably their limited generalization capabilities. Our proposed open-source environments and comprehensive analysis show promising boost to future research in garment manipulation by unlocking the full potential of these methods. We guarantee that we will open-source our code as soon as possible. You can watch the videos in supplementary files to learn more about the details of our work.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18279v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</description>

      <title>AutoLife: Automatic Life Journaling with Smartphones and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mobile sensing application - life journaling - designed to generate semantic descriptions of users' daily lives. We present AutoLife, an automatic life journaling system based on commercial smartphones. AutoLife only inputs low-cost sensor data (without photos or audio) from smartphones and can automatically generate comprehensive life journals for users. To achieve this, we first derive time, motion, and location contexts from multimodal sensor data, and harness the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enriched with commonsense knowledge about human lives, to interpret diverse contexts and generate life journals. To manage the task complexity and long sensing duration, a multilayer framework is proposed, which decomposes tasks and seamlessly integrates LLMs with other techniques for life journaling. This study establishes a real-life dataset as a benchmark and extensive experiment results demonstrate that AutoLife produces accurate and reliable life journals.</description>
