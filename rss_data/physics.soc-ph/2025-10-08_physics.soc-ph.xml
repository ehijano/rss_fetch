      <title>Integrating Weather and Land Cover Data into Geospatial Impact Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating gridded weather and earth observation data into impact evaluations holds great promise. It allows researchers to capture environmental context, external shocks, and even to measure outcomes (e.g., land cover change, agricultural production) that surveys might miss due to spatial or temporal data collection constraints. However, with great power comes great responsibility: the increasing ease of extracting time series from these datasets belies potentially complex geospatial and measurement issues that can affect the magnitude, direction, as well as interpretation of impact evaluation estimates. This chapter highlights several of the most common issues while providing resources to help guide researchers to thoughtfully use (and avoid misuse) of weather, vegetation, land cover, and extreme event data in the context of geospatial impact evaluation.</description>

      <title>'Partisan Bias' is Like 'Cancer'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The colloquial phrase "partisan bias" encompasses multiple distinct conceptions of bias, including partisan advantage, packing &amp; cracking, and partisan symmetry. All are useful and have their place, and there are several proposed measures of each. While different measures frequently signal the direction of bias consistently for redistricting plans, sometimes the signals are contradictory: for example, one metric says a map is biased towards Democrats while another metric say the same map is biased towards Republicans. This happens most frequently with metrics that measure different kinds of bias, but it also occurs between measures in the same category. These inconsistencies are most pronounced in states where one party is dominant, but they also occur across the full range of partisan balance. The political geography of states also influences the frequency with which various measures are inconsistent in their assessment of bias. No subset of metrics is always internally consistent in their signal of bias.</description>

      <title>Functional Connectivity Networks for Transportation Delay Analysis: from Theory to Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the endeavour of modelling and understanding the propagation of delays in transportation networks, an approach that has attracted increasing interest in the last decade is the creation of functional network representations. These graphs map elements of interest (e.g. airports or stations) as nodes, and derive pairwise propagation patterns from their dynamics through correlation and causality tests. In spite of multiple notable results, this approach still lacks a coherent framework, with decisions related to many fundamental steps being left to the judgement of the researcher. We here provide an introduction to the theory behind functional networks for transportation systems, detailing the main steps and the associated pitfalls. We further introduce a Python package, delaynet, designed to support the researcher in the reconstruction and analysis of such networks. We finally present an analysis of the propagation of delays in the Swiss train system; and discuss future research steps.</description>

      <title>Ethical considerations in infectious disease modelling for public health policy: the case of school closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of infectious diseases are frequently used as a tool to support public health policy and decisions around implementation of interventions such as school closures. However, most publications on policy-relevant modelling lack an ethical framework and do not explicitly consider the ethical implications of the work. This creates a risk that unintended consequences of interventions are overlooked or that models are used to justify decisions that are inconsistent with public health ethics. In this article, we focus on the case study of school closures as a commonly modelled intervention against pandemic influenza, COVID-19, and other infectious disease threats. We briefly review some of the key concepts in public health ethics and describe approaches to modelling the effects of school closures. We then identify a series of ethical considerations involved in modelling school closures. These include accounting for population heterogeneity and inequalities; including a diversity of viewpoints and expertise in model design; considering the distribution of benefits and harms; and model transparency and contextualisation. We conclude with some recommendations to ensure that policy-relevant modelling is consistent with some key ethics values.</description>

      <title>Evolution of social behaviors in noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory offers a general framework to study how behaviors evolve by social learning in a population. This body of theory can accommodate a range of social dilemmas, or games, as well as real-world complexities such as spatial structure or behaviors conditioned on reputations. Nonetheless, this approach typically assumes a deterministic payoff structure for social interactions. Here, we extend evolutionary game theory to account for random changes in the social environment, so that mutual cooperation may bring different rewards today than it brings tomorrow, for example. Even when such environmental noise is unbiased, we find it can have a qualitative impact on the behaviors that evolve in a population. Noisy payoffs can permit the stable co-existence of cooperators and defectors in the prisoner's dilemma, for example, as well as bistability in snowdrift games and stable limit cycles in rock-paper-scissors games -- dynamical phenomena that cannot occur in the absence of noise. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our framework to scenarios where the nature of social interactions is subject to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Binary Option Market Manipulation by Influencing Belief Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques from information geometry, we construct a semi-Hamiltonian system modelling trader beliefs in a binary asset market and study the impact of inequality or asymmetry in beliefs, information, and power on price dynamics. We show that in a market with no inequality and $N$ completely symmetric traders, the resulting dynamics evolve on a $2N + 1$ dimensional manifold consisting of a $2N-2$ dimensional centre manifold, a $2$ dimensional stable manifold and a $1$ dimensional slow manifold. Introducing asymmetry into the traders has the potential to decrease the dimension of the centre manifold, which we prove using a parameter analysis. Using the belief model, we also study the impact of inter-agent communication, exogenous information and asymmetric purchasing power on price dynamics, showing that market bubbles can emerge when powerful traders produce outsize influence in the market, thus impacting other traders' beliefs as well as the price. This process is exacerbated when back-channel communication is permitted. The impact of areas of high curvature in belief space is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order interactions that nonlinearly couple more than two nodes are ubiquitous in networked systems. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of dynamical systems with higher-order interactions, and of the techniques which can be used to describe and analyze them. We focus in particular on new phenomena that emerge when nonpairwise interactions are considered. We conclude by discussing open questions and promising future directions on the collective dynamics of higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Critical thresholds in stochastic rumors on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vertices of a tree represent individuals in one of three states: ignorant, spreader, or stifler. A spreader transmits the rumor to any of its nearest ignorant neighbors at rate one. At the same rate, a spreader becomes a stifler after contacting nearest-neighbor spreaders or stiflers. The rumor survives if, at all times, there exists at least one spreader. We consider two extensions and prove phase transition results for rumor survival. First, we consider the infinite Cayley tree of coordination number $d+1$, with $d\geq 2$, and assume that as soon as an ignorant hears the rumor, the individual becomes spreader with probability $p$, or stifler with probability $1-p$. Using coupling with branching processes we prove that for any $d$ there is a phase transition in $p$ and localize the critical parameter. By refining this approach, we extend the study to an inhomogeneous tree with hubs of degree $d+1$ and other vertices of degree at most $k=o(d)$. The purpose of this extension is to illustrate the impact of the distance between hubs on the dissemination of rumors in a network. To this end, we assume that each hub is, on average, connected to $\alpha (d+1)$ hubs, with $\alpha\in (0,1]$, via paths of length $h$. We obtain a phase transition result in $\alpha$ in terms of $d,k,$ and $h$, and we show that in the case of $k=\Theta(\log d)$ phase transition occurs iff $h \lesssim \Theta( \log d / (\log \log d))$.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>

      <title>Emergent Directedness in Social Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An enduring challenge in contagion theory is that the pathways contagions follow through social networks exhibit emergent complexities that are difficult to predict using network structure. Here, we address this challenge by developing a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network pathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and nodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This yields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to adopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge often only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the more asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes canonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning network regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration - prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other. Emergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from the network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We demonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness accounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a recent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn. Lastly, we show that network evolution is biased toward growing directed paths, but that cultural factors (e.g., triadic closure) can curtail this bias, with strategic implications for network building and behavioral interventions.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and virality detection using early warning signals in rumor models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and intervention strategies of a rumor using the modified Maki-Thompson model. A key challenge in social networks is distinguishing between natural increases in transmissibility and artificial injections of rumor spreaders, such as through broadcast events or astroturfing. Using stochastic simulations, we compare two scenarios: one with organic growth in transmissibility, and another with externally injected spreaders. Although both lead to high autocorrelation, only the organic growth produces oscillatory patterns in autocorrelation at multiple lags, an effect we can analytically explain using the N-intertwined mean-field (NIMFA) approximation. This distinction offers a practical tool to identify the origin of rumor virality and also infer its transmissibility. Our approach is validated analytically and tested on real-world data from Twitter during the announcement of the Higgs boson discovery. In addition to detection, we also explore control strategies. We show that the average lifetime of a rumor can be manipulated through targeted interventions: placing spreaders at specific locations in the network. Depending on their placement, these interventions can either extend or shorten the lifespan of the rumor.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric study on mathematical oncology: interdisciplinarity, internationality, collaboration and trending topics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical oncology is an interdisciplinary research field where the mathematical sciences meet cancer research. Being situated at the intersection of these two fields makes mathematical oncology highly dynamic, as practicing researchers are incentivised to quickly adapt to both technical and medical research advances. Determining the scope of mathematical oncology is therefore not straightforward; however, it is important for purposes related to funding allocation, education, scientific communication, and community organisation. To address this issue, we here conduct a bibliometric analysis of mathematical oncology. We compare our results to the broader field of mathematical biology, and position our findings within theoretical science of science frameworks.
  Based on article metadata and citation flows, our results provide evidence that mathematical oncology has undergone a significant evolution since the 1960s marked by increased interactions with other disciplines, geographical expansion, larger research teams, and greater diversity in studied topics. The latter finding contributes to the greater discussion on which models different research communities consider to be valuable in the era of big data and machine learning. Further, the results presented in this study quantitatively motivate that international collaboration networks should be supported to enable new countries to enter and remain in the field, and that mathematical oncology benefits both mathematics and the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <title>HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.
