      <title>Defending the Quantum Reconstruction Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The program of reconstructing quantum theory based on information-theoretic principles enjoys much popularity in the foundations of physics. Surprisingly, this endeavor has only received very little attention in philosophy. Here I argue that this should change. This is because, on the one hand, reconstructions can help us to better understand quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, reconstructions are themselves in need of interpretation. My overall objective, thus, is to motivate the reconstruction program and to show why philosophers should care. My specific aims are threefold. (i) Clarify the relationship between reconstructing and interpreting quantum mechanics, (ii) show how the informational reconstruction of quantum theory puts pressure on standard realist interpretations, (iii) defend the quantum reconstruction program against possible objections.</description>

      <title>Un contributo al dibattito sui rapporti tra i cataloghi stellari di Tolomeo e Ipparco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty about the relationships between the star catalogue contained in the Almagest (books VII-VIII) and the catalogue of Hipparchus dates back to the origins of modern astronomy. The fact that Hipparchus' catalogue was lost and that his observations of a limited number of stars remained has favored the formulation of various hypotheses on the subject. The recent discovery of (at least) a part of Hipparchus' catalogue seems to indicate that there are various concordances between the two catalogues, but also differences sufficient to suggest that Ptolemy's catalogue also derives from sources independent of Hipparchus' catalogue. This article presents an additional element for the comparison between the two catalogues, based on the diversity of the observation locations of the two astronomers, which provides an argument against the originality of the Ptolemaic catalogue.</description>

      <title>Nanopore DNA Sequencing Technology: A Sociological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing, a next-generation sequencing technology, holds the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of life sciences, forensics, and healthcare. While previous research has focused on its technical intricacies and biomedical applications, this paper offers a unique perspective by scrutinizing the societal dimensions (ethical, legal, and social implications) of nanopore sequencing. Employing the lenses of Diffusion and Action Network Theory, we examine the dissemination of nanopore sequencing in society as a potential consumer product, contributing to the field of the sociology of technology. We investigate the possibility of interactions between human and nonhuman actors in developing nanopore technology to analyse how various stakeholders, such as companies, regulators, and researchers, shape the trajectory of the growth of nanopore sequencing. This work offers insights into the social construction of nanopore sequencing, shedding light on the actors, power dynamics, and socio-technical networks that shape its adoption and societal impact. Understanding the sociological dimensions of this transformative technology is vital for responsible development, equitable distribution, and inclusive integration into diverse societal contexts.</description>
