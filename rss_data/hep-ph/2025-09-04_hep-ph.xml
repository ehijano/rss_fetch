      <title>Neutrino masses from an alternative approach to the seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative approach to obtaining neutrino masses, distinct from the traditional seesaw mechanism, is proposed. This method relies on the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices derived from a twisted Lagrangian density of the neutrino matter sector. This approach avoids the need for introducing heavy Majorana neutrinos, thereby reducing the number of free parameters in the Standard Model (SM). We present numerical results for neutrino masses that align with experimental data, and we introduce a new parameter, $\alpha_\nu$, to fine-tune the mass differences $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$. The proposed framework connects the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the known masses of quarks and charged leptons, providing an unified perspective on the matter sector of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Flow between extremal one-point energy correlators in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy density generated by a vector current is characterized by a single parameter $a_{\mathcal{E}}$ bounded by unitarity to $-1/2 \leq a_{\mathcal{E}} \leq 1$, with extremal values saturated by free theories of different matter content. Through confinement, QCD transmutes fermionic matter into scalars, revealing a nontrivial flow between extremal correlators. We reconstruct this flow using perturbative QCD and chiral perturbation theory. The observable is accessible with currently available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Resonant Scattering of Boosted Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simulation within GENIE of the excitation of baryonic resonances by boosted dark matter. This work completes the simulation of all scattering modes for dark matter entering a detector at relativistic speeds. At some boosts, resonant scattering can contribute over 30% to the scattering rate. This channel offers a potentially powerful probe of the isospin structure of dark matter interactions via the relative prominence of the isospin-changing $\Delta$ resonance. We study the estimated sensitivity of large volume detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO to all dark matter scattering modes and demonstrate the expected improvement in sensitivity when resonant scattering is included.</description>

      <title>Multi-Higgs Amplitudes Bootstrapped: Dissecting SMEFT and HEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the Higgs boson properties requires a robust framework to parametrize possible deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions in the most model-independent way possible. The Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework has become the most widely used since it offers a broad scope and a consistent path to increase the precision of the computations. Two prominent EFTs are the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). While similar in many aspects, their phenomenological differences are nowhere more pronounced than in multi-Higgs production. To precisely chart the separation between both EFTs, we study gluon-fusion double and triple Higgs production using bootstrapped on-shell amplitudes. This allows us to get the kinematic dependence of the gauge-invariant amplitude without field-redefinition ambiguities. As part of our study, we develop a technique that allows to build tree-level five-point on-shell amplitudes from lower-point on-shell amplitudes and bootstrapped contact terms. We then match the bootstrapped on-shell scattering amplitudes to the amplitudes computed in SMEFT (up to order $1/\Lambda^4$) and HEFT (at NNLO) and analyze the EFT order at which each kinematic structure appears. We also show how certain structures in $gg\to hhh$ appear only at dimension-12 in SMEFT or N$^3$LO in HEFT.</description>

      <title>Burdening (or not) gravitational waves in the presence of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of primordial gravitational wave (GW) expected from the presence of primordial black holes (PBH) and inflaton in the early Universe. For the first time, we combine the waves produced by the PBH decay, with their density fluctuation counterpart, as well as their effects on the GW produced by the inflaton {\it after} (high frequency modes) and {\it before} (low frequency modes) the end of inflation. We generalize our study for a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^k$ during reheating. We also extend our study, taking into account a possible memory burden effect to see how it can affect the shape of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Analysis-ready Generative Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based unfolding methods have enabled high-dimensional and unbinned differential cross section measurements. While a suite of such methods has been proposed, most focus exclusively on the challenge of statistically removing resolution effects. In practice, unfolding methods must also account for impurities and finite acceptance and efficiency effects. In this paper, we extend a class of unfolding methods based on generative ML to include the full suite of effects relevant for cross section measurements. Our new methods include fully generative solutions as well as generative-discriminative hybrid approaches (GenFoldG and GenFoldC). We demonstrate these new techniques in both Gaussian and simulated LHC examples. Overall, we find that both methods are able to accommodate all effects, thus adding a complementary and analysis-ready method to the unfolding toolkit.</description>

      <title>Constraining axial non-standard neutrino interactions with MINOS and MINOS+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the neutral current data of the MINOS and MINOS+ experiments can provide information on the axial neutral current non-standard interactions of neutrinos with the $u$ and $d$ quarks; {\it i.e.,} on $\epsilon_{\alpha \beta}^{Aq}$. We derive bounds on the $ee$, $e\tau$ and $\tau \tau$ components of these couplings and show that the MINOS(+) bounds on $\epsilon^{Aq}_{e\tau}$ and $\epsilon^{Aq}_{\tau\tau}$ are currently the world leading ones. The bound on the isospin singlet case, $\epsilon^{Au}_{\tau\tau}=\epsilon^{Ad}_{\tau\tau}$ is of particular interest because while this isospin singlet NSI is theoretically motivated, it was practically unconstrained before these results.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter in the Presence of Scalar Leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extension of the vector-like lepton dark matter model by introducing scalar leptoquarks that modify the properties of the vector-like lepton dark matter candidate, helping it evade stringent direct detection constraints. In the minimal setup, the neutral component of a pure $SU(2)$ doublet vector-like lepton fails to simultaneously account for the observed relic abundance while remaining consistent with current direct detection limits. We show that the addition of the scalar leptoquarks can induce corrections to the mass of the vector-like lepton dark matter, splitting it into two non-degenerate pseudo-Dirac states. This mass splitting can help evade the direct detection bounds naturally. In addition, the extended setup also opens up a larger parameter space of the model that can accommodate the correct relic density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the vacuum-to-vacuum correlator of two quark tensor currents with two massive quarks, retaining full momentum dependence. For the first time, we include perturbative corrections up to next-to-leading order. Our fully analytical expressions are provided in machine-readable form. Furthermore, we present numerical results for various input parameters, including an estimate of the scale uncertainties. Our results are essential input for applications of dispersive methods, including unitarity bounds and QCD sum rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introduction to perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, focusing on a pedagogical description of concepts and methods to calculate cross sections measured at high energy colliders. After introducing basic concepts that allow for a perturbative expansion, such as factorisation and asymptotic freedom, we introduce loop integrals and the treatment of ultraviolet and infrared divergences in QCD. The definition of jets and event shape observables is also discussed. Finally, we give a brief overview of the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newton's law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are utterly negligible when considering the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop-induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newton's law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa-type deviations and inverse-square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth-force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and future experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. Our results provide a model-independent framework for confronting dark-sector scenarios with precision gravity data, and highlight the complementarity of particle physics and short-distance gravitational tests in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Pions with the MoEDAL-MAPP Detector at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for detecting pion-like dark matter within the framework of a Strongly Interacting Massive Particle (SIMP) model using the MoEDAL Apparatus for Penetrating Particles (MAPP) at the LHC. The model, motivated by Chiral Perturbation Theory, features milli-charged dark pions that couple to Standard Model particles via kinetic mixing with a dark photon. Production channels considered include Drell--Yan pair production and photon fusion via the Wess--Zumino--Witten term, the latter providing a distinctive three-body final state signature. Cross-sections are computed using MadGraph and WHIZARD for a range of dark pion masses, decay constants, and dark $Z$ boson masses. Sensitivity projections for MAPP-1 during the High-Luminosity LHC phase are presented under a background-free assumption, showing competitive reach into previously unexplored parameter space for milli-charged dark pseudoscalars. These results highlight the complementary role of MoEDAL-MAPP in probing dark sector models and motivate further detector-level simulations to refine exclusion limits.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large-$N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme (TRS) -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis (ICC). On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the first-order QCD phase transition in dense strong interaction matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which suggests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>Lee--Yang edge singularities in Nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase diagram and the associated Lee--Yang edge singularities using the two-flavor nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model extended to complex chemical potential. There exists a strong correlation between the chiral phase transition and the structure of the effective potential in the complex order parameter plane, serving as a criterion to differentiate crossover from first-order transitions. Typically, the Lee--Yang edge singularities can be understood as a generalization of the critical end-point (CEP) between crossover and first-order transitions, where the positive Nambu phase and the Wigner phase coalesce. We further analyze the scaling behavior near the CEP by extracting the critical exponent associated with the Lee--Yang singularities. Additionally, we confirm that the extrapolation of the Lee--Yang edge singularity trajectories provides an effective method of determining the CEP location, even at a small real chemical potential. This provides a viable method for exploring regions of the QCD phase diagram that remain inaccessible to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>The role of the soft scale for $J/\psi$ production in the transverse momentum dependent framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use vNRQCD to study power corrections in the ${\rm v}$ expansion due to soft gluon radiation during $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum. We categorize four new $J/\psi$ production operators that mediate the transition of perturbatively produced color-octet charm quark/anti-quark pairs to charm quarks in a $^3S_1^{[1]}$ state via soft gluon emission. We then use Soft Collinear Effective Theory and vNRQCD to derive a factorization theorem for $J/\psi$ production in SIDIS in terms of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs in the proton and new objects which we call TMD soft transition functions. We show that the TMD soft transition function leads in the ${\rm v}$ power-counting with respect to the color-octet TMD shape functions that have been used in previous studies of $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze neutrino oscillations from the perspective of quantum complementarity by extending the familiar wave-particle duality into a exact triality relation among visibility, predictability, and entanglement. Using a density-matrix approach, we construct explicit measures of these quantities in both two- and three-flavor frameworks and show that they satisfy an exact conservation-like identity throughout oscillation evolution. In this picture, visibility corresponds to interference strength, predictability to flavor imbalance, and entanglement to the reduction of purity due to flavor correlations. We demonstrate that neutrino oscillations naturally exhibit regimes of maximal entanglement, vanishing coherence, and entanglement monogamy constraining flavor correlations. Our results establish that long-baseline neutrino oscillations realize the triality relation in an energy-dependent way, with T2K probing vacuum-like coherence entanglement balance and DUNE revealing the decisive role of matter e ects in redistributing the quantum information budget.</description>

      <title>Confronting the production mechanisms of nuclei with deuteron and proton-triggered balance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultra high-energy collisions, nuclei with very low binding energies are not expected to survive the dense and hot final state environment. The traditional view has therefore been that nuclei form via coalescence after the hot environment has dissipated. However, statistical thermal models, where hadrons are produced from a fireball at thermal equilibrium, can describe the relative abundances of light nuclei in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC equally well. In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by protons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production mechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the statistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal-FIST package. We find that for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron triggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking difference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger particles is varied. This dependence offers a promising observable to discriminate between the two production scenarios that goes beyond nuclei production.</description>

      <title>Two-sector leptogenesis in a two-Higgs-doublet model with spontaneous CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the Standard Model (SM) field content with one inert Higgs doublet (IHD) and three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) is a well-motivated approach. The key advantages of the model include the appearance of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) like dark matter (DM) candidate from the neutral component of the IHD, along with the plausible explanation of the sub-eV mass range of SM neutrinos via the radiative seesaw mechanism. Additionally, the decay of RHNs can contextualize the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis and is intricately connected to CP violation. Also, given the ongoing searches for light scalars at various experimental facilities, the extended Higgs sector of the model continues to be at the forefront. However, this scotogenic framework encounters a deficiency in providing the observed amount of relic density for a particular mass range $\sim (80 - 500) $ GeV of its DM candidate, hence requiring further augmentation. Also, the WIMP scenarios have not yet resulted in conclusive hints at the direct detection experiments. In this context, our work is based on further extension of the above Scotogenic model by a dark sector. Additionally, considering the cosmic coincidence aspect, we operate within the framework of two-sector leptogenesis. To have a predictive flavor structure in the visible sector, we impose $A_4$ symmetry. Also, we adhere to spontaneous CP violation via complex vacuum expectation value of the falvon field, leading to a situation where there is only one CP-violating phase as a common connection between the visible and dark sectors. In our analysis, we find for the lightest RHN mass $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV, our results are in good agreement with the observational ratio of relic densities, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM}/\Omega_{\rm b} \sim 5$ for a few GeV range of mass of the dark sector DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Charge asymmetry in the process $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge asymmetry in the process $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\gamma$ is studied for photons with energies $\nu\ll\sqrt{s}$. The longitudinal polarization of electrons (positrons) is taken into account. The asymmetry arises due to interference of the amplitudes for production of pion states with opposite $C$ parities. The contribution of $a_1^0(1260)$ meson in the intermediate state to the charge asymmetry is discussed. This contribution is not the leading one, however it is not negligible. It is shown that the charge asymmetry can reach several tens of percent.</description>

      <title>A novel force from the curved field space: Lepton flavor violation and $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the nonzero curvature extension of the field space for the charged leptons induces a peculiar force, leading to an elegant and simple mechanism for generating the charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) and their anomalous magnetic moment, which has not been explored in the literature. This novel force corrects the electromagnetic vertex, leading to an effective coupling which is flavor off-diagonal at tree level. Consequently, it yields the CLFV decays with a very strongly amplified sensitivity, allowing for the CLFV probes in the small flavor-violating parameter region which is out of reach of the previous models. We point out a new type of contribution for the anomalous magnetic moment of the charged leptons, coming from the electric form factor corrected by the force emerging from the curved field space.</description>

      <title>Searching for HWW Anomalous Couplings with Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the source of the universe's asymmetry between matter and antimatter is one of the major open questions in particle physics. In this work, the sensitivity of novel machine-learning-based inference techniques to CP-odd and CP-even $HWW$ anomalous couplings is studied in the $\\WH \rightarrow \ell \nu b\bar{b}$ channel ($\ell = e, \mu$), within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Two machine-learning simulation-based inference (SBI) methods are explored: a per-event likelihood-ratio estimator, which directly approximates the ratio of probability densities between competing hypotheses, is benchmarked against a per-event optimal-observable estimator optimized for sensitivity to the parameters of interest. Both approaches are also compared to traditional summary statistics, in this case histograms of kinematic and angular observables, as commonly used in experimental analyses. SBI methods provide tighter constraints than one-dimensional summary statistics, though their performance is comparable to two-dimensional histogram analysis. The optimal-observable approach remains promising for its ability to probe multiple couplings simultaneously. Restricting the analysis to a region of high $S/B$ also enhances sensitivity to CP-odd operators while preserving sensitivity to CP-even operators, which histogram analyses often lose. Although the likelihood-ratio estimator sometimes struggles with likelihood minima and shapes, optimisations that target its robustness could make it more sensitive than both the optimal-observable estimator and the histogram method. These results underscore the potential of advanced simulation-based inference techniques, encouraging further exploration with LHC Run 3 data to surpass current ATLAS and CMS sensitivities.</description>

      <title>On the renormalization-group analysis of the SM: loops, uncertainties, and vacuum stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization-group equations (RGE) is one of the key tools in studying high-energy behavior of the Standard Model (SM). We begin by reviewing one-loop RGE for the dimensionless couplings of the SM and proceed to the state-of-the-art results. Our study focuses on the RGE solutions at different loop orders. We compare not only the standard (``diagonal'') loop counting, when one considers gauge, Yukawa, and scalar self-coupling beta functions at the same order, but also ``non-diagonal'' ones, inspired by the so-called Weyl consistency conditions. We discuss the initial conditions for RGE (``matching'') for different loop configurations, and study the uncertainties of running coupling both related to the limited precision of the experimental input (``parametric'') and to the missing high-order corrections (``theoretical''). As an application of our analysis we also estimate the electroweak vacuum decay probability and study how the uncertainties in the running parameters affect the latter. We argue that the ``non-diagonal'' beta functions, if coupled with more consistent ``non-diagonal'' matching lead to larger theoretical uncertainty than the ``diagonal'' ones.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Dark Matter in Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giants (RGs) provide a promising astrophysical environment for capturing dark matter (DM) via elastic scattering with stellar nuclei. Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \,{\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entropy production in Deep Inelastic Scattering using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the dominant contribution to entropy is due to soft gluons. This contribution is usually neglected in standard Monte Carlo approaches, since it does not affect hadronic spectra. However, it is relevant for entropy and multiplicity distributions, as we demonstrate with explicit calculations. We further show that, as one lowers the cutoff - i.e. includes soft gluons - thereby making the Monte Carlo parton distributions closer to inclusive PDFs, the resulting entropy is very close to that measured by the H1 collaboration, without the need to account for hadronization effects. This provides further evidence that the bulk of the measured entropy originates from initial-state effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a {\em boomerang mechanism} for the explanation of the excess radio background detected by ARCADE. In an early stage, at a temperature $T \sim 100\,{\rm keV}$, a fraction of relic neutrinos is resonantly converted into dark neutrinos by mixing induced by a pre-existing lepton asymmetry. Dark neutrinos decay much later into a dark photon, mixed with photon, and a dark fermion, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe, as required by a solution to the excess radio background. This scenario circumvents the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment but still implies a testable lower bound.</description>

      <title>Probing a Light Scalar Boson with a few-MeV Proton Beam Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the production of a light scalar boson $\phi$ in low-energy proton-nucleus interactions using the 3.5 MV accelerator of the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility, located in the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory. Nuclear reactions induced by a few-MeV proton beam on suitable target materials can act as a controlled source of $\phi$ particles. Owing to the deep-underground location, the facility benefits from substantial cosmic-ray shielding, enabling searches for rare processes with minimal background. The produced $\phi$ particles will be sought with large-volume, low-background detectors already operating or currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. This approach combines a tunable accelerator-based production mechanism with the exceptional sensitivity of underground rare-event searches, offering a novel avenue to probe light scalar bosons beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory has strong implications for cosmology: it tells us that we cannot have a cosmological constant, that single-field slow-roll inflation is ruled out, and that black holes decay. We elucidate the origin of these statements within the string-theoretical swampland programme. The swampland programme is generating a growing body of insights that have yet to be incorporated into cosmological models. Taking a cosmologist's perspective, we highlight the relevance of swampland conjectures to black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, including their implications for scalar fields such as quintessence and axions. Our goal is to inspire cosmological model builders to examine the compatibility of effective field theories with quantum gravitational UV completions and to address outstanding cosmological tensions such as the Hubble tension. This comprehensive literature review presents clear definitions, cosmological implications, and the current status - including evidence and counterexamples - of the following swampland conjectures: the anti-de Sitter distance conjecture (AdSDC), the completeness conjecture (CC), the cobordism conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture (dSC), the swampland distance conjecture (SDC), the emergence proposal (EP), the Festina Lente Bound (FLB), the finite number of massless fields conjecture (or finite flux vacua conjecture (FFV)), the no global symmetries conjecture, the no non-supersymmetric theories conjecture, the non-negative null energy condition conjecture, the positive Gauss-Bonnet term conjecture, the species scale conjecture, the gravitino swampland conjecture (GSC), the tadpole conjecture, the tameness conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (tPCC/TCC), the unique geodesic conjecture, and the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), including the repulsive force conjecture (RFC).</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) &gt; a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.</description>

      <title>Dark tranquility: Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. However, the behavior of wave propagation in such extreme habitats remains rich and nuanced. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that persist without ever reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-ordered multilayer integrals have long been cited as major challenges in the analytical study of cosmological correlators and wavefunction coefficients. The recently proposed family tree decomposition technique solved these time integrals in terms of canonical objects called family trees, which are multivariate hypergeometric functions with energies as variables and twists as parameters. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the analytical properties of family trees. By exploiting the great flexibility of Mellin representations of family trees, we identify and characterize all their singularities in both variables and parameters and find their exact series representations around all singularities with finite convergent domains. These series automatically generate analytical continuation of arbitrary family trees over many distinct regions in the energy space. As a corollary, we show the factorization of family trees at zero partial-energy singularities to all orders. Our findings offer essential analytical data for further understanding and computing cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: mapping cosmological collider models to weak-lensing observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are features in the initial density field that provide a window into the nonlinear dynamics of particles during the inflationary epoch. Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from "cosmological collider physics" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite.

      <title>Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: signatures of inflationary resonances, excitations, and scale dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are imprints in the initial density field sourced by the dynamics of inflation. These dynamics can induce scale dependence, oscillations, and other features in the primordial bispectrum. We analyze a suite of over thirty PNG templates, including those used in the _Planck_ analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and resolve their signatures in the deeply nonlinear regime of the late-time density field. Using simulations, we forecast results from a lensing analysis of the Year-10 data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that lensing achieves sensitivity comparable to the CMB for many models, and even surpasses it for templates whose features peak on smaller scales, $k \gtrsim 0.2 h/{\rm Mpc}$. Many templates generate non-monotonic behaviors in mass and length scales, providing a distinct phenomenology in the resulting late-time structure. We simulate, for the first time, resonant signatures consistently in both the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. The constraints on their amplitudes $(A_{\rm pk}, f_{\rm NL})$ are essentially independent, as each affects structure formation in distinct ways. Overall, we find that lensing data can provide competitive and complementary constraints on these models, and can deliver leading constraints when the primordial features are predominantly on smaller scales. The data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite. Our initial conditions generator is publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Aarambam.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>The 2020 Superburst of 4U 1608-522 and its impact on the accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superbursts are rare events observed from bursting neutron star low mass X-ray binaries. They are thought to originate from unstable burning of the thick layer of Carbon on the surface of the neutron star, causing the observed X-ray flashes to last several hours. Given their fluence it has long been thought that superbursts may have significant effects on the accretion flow around the neutron star. In this paper, we first present evidence for a new superburst observed from 4U 1608-522 by MAXI during the 2020 outburst, around 00:45 UTC on 16 July 2020. We compare some of the properties of this superburst and the underlying outburst with the events recorded on May 5 2005 by RXTE and most recently in 2025 by MAXI. We then present our spectral analysis of NICER and Insight-HXMT data obtained before and after the 2020 superburst event. Our results indicate that the inner disk temperature and the radius show a systematic evolution in the following few days, which may be related to the superburst. We show that the timescale of the observed evolution can not be governed by viscous timescales unless the viscosity parameter is unrealistically low.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of neutron properties, like its permanent electric dipole moment, rely on understanding complex experimental setups in detail. We show how the properties of stored and transported ultracold neutron ensembles can be simulated reliably. In a second step, we illustrate how they can be used for simulation-based inference of the parameters associated with underlying physics processes such as neutron capture or beta decay. Our proof of principle for simulation-based inference confronts a longstanding challenge with ultracold neutrons: low measurement statistics coupled with a complex apparatus.</description>

      <title>Observational challenges to holographic and Ricci dark energy paradigms: Insights from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w&gt;-1$ at early times to $w&lt;-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w&gt;-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.</description>

      <title>The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.</description>

      <title>Origin of nucleon mass in the light of PSR J0614-3329 with quark-hadron crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent NICER observation of PSR J0614-3329, revealing the smallest reliably measured neutron star radius of $R = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km at mass $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_\odot$, provides an unprecedented constraint on the equation of state of dense matter. We investigate the implications of this measurement for the origin of nucleon mass within the parity doublet model framework, which naturally incorporates both chiral variant and chiral invariant mass components. We construct unified equations of state by employing the parity doublet model with isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ for hadronic matter up to twice nuclear saturation density, smoothly connected to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type quark model at higher densities through a crossover transition. By systematically varying the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ and quark matter parameters, we determine which values simultaneously satisfy all current astrophysical constraints, including gravitational wave observations from GW170817, NICER measurements of several pulsars, and the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars. The inclusion of PSR J0614-3329 dramatically refines the allowed range of the chiral invariant mass from the previous constraint of $580~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$ to $800~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$, raising the lower bound by approximately 220 MeV. This result indicates that the chiral invariant mass must constitute at least 85\% of the nucleon mass, challenging the traditional picture of nucleon mass generation through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking alone and highlighting the importance of gluon condensation and other non-chiral mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the Black Hole Interior Volume and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent investigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper entitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole interior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior volume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a space-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$. Using this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is proportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this formulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of infalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the charged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical analysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the volume linearly increases with advancing time.
  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black hole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black hole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality constant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy is less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note that these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than the Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand the uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Suppression of dynamical momentum-space shell by chiral symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of quark degrees of freedom in dense isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. We employ the parity doublet model to incorporate chiral dynamics. Specifically, we contrast quarkyonic matter, in which quarks occupy states above the nucleon Fermi surface, with baryquark matter, in which quarks populate states inside the nucleonic Fermi sea. We find that while baryquark matter is generally energetically favored over quarkyonic matter, the self-consistent treatment of the momentum-space shell reveals that purely hadronic matter provides the lowest free energy up to densities well beyond nuclear saturation. Consequently, the contribution of quarks is not relevant within the model's domain of applicability, even though chiral symmetry becomes restored. This demonstrates that the onset of quark degrees of freedom and the restoration of chiral symmetry need not coincide.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in charmed hadron physics, driven by numerous experimental discoveries of exotic states such as $T^+_{cc}$ and $P_c$. These findings have highlighted the importance of understanding charmed hadron interactions. With significant advances in theory and computation, lattice QCD has become a reliable tool for studying nonperturbative dynamics of low-energy QCD. In this talk, I review recent lattice QCD studies of charmed hadron interactions, focusing on three representative systems: $D^*$-$D$, $N$-$c\bar c$, and $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$.</description>

      <title>Amplified capture rate of dark matter in compact binaries and constraints on bosonic dark matter from GW170817</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion of dark matter (DM) onto compact objects and the potential gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to this accretion has become a promising indirect probe of DM properties, complementing terrestrial experiments. We show that the accretion flux of DM on stellar objects is amplified in binary systems due to the complex gravitational interaction of said particles with the binary. We perform few-body Monte Carlo simulations to show that this amplification factor is $\sim4-5$ for circular binaries, small DM velocity dispersions and mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.3$. We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817. We also show that the maximally accretable mass fraction of DM by binary NSs is $\lesssim10^{-3}$, even for extreme DM densities only possible in DM spikes, due to the dynamical friction exerted by the ambient DM.</description>

      <title>Two-loop vacuum polarization in a Coulomb field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading-order two-loop vacuum-polarization potential, linear in the Coulomb field of a nucleus, was first derived in the seminal 1955 work of K\"all\'en-Sabry. The higher-order two-loop vacuum-polarization corrections, however, have remained unknown until now. In this work, we compute Coulomb corrections to the K\"all\'en-Sabry potential, specifically those involving three, five, and seven Coulomb interactions inside the vacuum-polarization loop. The potentials are evaluated in momentum space and subsequently used to calculate one-electron energy shifts. Our results drastically reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the two-loop vacuum-polarization contribution to transition energies, which is required for next-generation tests of bound-state QED in heavy one and few-electron ions as well as for the determination of nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Structure of renormalization constants for theories with multiple couplings in the MS-like subtraction schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For theories with multiple couplings we construct simple expressions for the four-dimensional (or, in general, integer-dimensional) renormalization constants assuming that all divergences are logarithmical. These expressions allow relating all coefficients at $\varepsilon$-poles, logarithms, and (if exist) mixed terms to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in any order of the perturbation theory for MS-like renormalization prescriptions. The result admits such a formulation in that $\varepsilon$-poles and $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ enter on the same footing. For theories with two and three couplings we present explicit expressions for the pole/logarithm structure of renormalization constants in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory. They are verified by comparisons with the three-loop explicit calculations made previously for the $\varphi^4$-theory with two couplings.</description>

      <title>Wigner function of a rigidly rotating and magnetized QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Wigner function of a rigidly rotating quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma in the presence of a constant magnetic field by utilizing the Riemannian normal coordinate approximation, which has been previously proposed in the literature. In this approach, the angular velocity appears only in a specific phase factor, allowing us to compute the point-split fermion two-point correlation function in flat spacetime. To ensure that the fermion correlation function is gauge invariant, we introduce a background gauge field that is fixed to produce a constant magnetic field. Using this Wigner function, we derive the energy-momentum tensor for this medium, which consists of both diagonal and off-diagonal components. By comparing our results with the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal spinful and vortical magnetized fluid, we establish a connection between these components and thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and different types of pressure. We demonstrate that rigid rotation leads to pressure anisotropy in plasma. Additionally, we compute the associated vector and axial vector currents for this medium, utilizing the previously presented Wigner function. Our results are consistent with existing literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Color-superconducting quarkyonic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

      <title>Probing an ultralight QCD axion with electromagnetic quadratic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-gluon coupling is the defining feature of the QCD axion. This feature induces additional and qualitatively different interactions of the axion with standard model particles -- quadratic couplings. Previously, hadronic quadratic couplings have been studied and experimental implications have been explored especially in the context of atomic spectroscopy and interferometry. We investigate additional quadratic couplings to the electromagnetic field and electron mass. These electromagnetic quadratic couplings are generated at the loop level from threshold corrections and are expected to be present in the absence of fine-tuning. While they are generally loop-suppressed compared to the hadronic ones, they open up new ways to search for the QCD axion, for instance via optical atomic clocks. Moreover, due to the velocity spread of the dark matter field, the quadratic nature of the coupling leads to low-frequency fluctuations in any detector setup. These distinctive low-frequency fluctuations offer a way to search for heavier axions. We provide an analytic expression for the power spectral density of this low-frequency background and briefly discuss experimental strategies for a low-frequency background search.</description>

      <title>A generalized statistical model for fits to parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) form an essential part of particle physics calculations. Currently, the most precise predictions for these non-perturbative functions are generated through fits to global data. A problem that several PDF fitting groups encounter is the presence of tension in data sets that appear to pull the fits in different directions. In other words, the best fit depends on the choice of data set. Several methods to capture the uncertainty in PDFs in presence of seemingly inconsistent fits have been proposed and are currently in use. These methods are important to ensure that uncertainty in PDFs are not underestimated. Here we propose a novel method for estimating the uncertainty by introducing a generalized statistical model based on Bayesian Hierarchical models which is implemented via the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The methodology is inspired by unsupervised machine learning techniques and is closely related to the statistical methods of Ensemble learning and Bayesian model averaging. Using a toy model of PDFs, we demonstrate how the GMM can be used to faithfully reconstruct the likelihood associated with PDF fits, which can in turn be used to accurately determine the uncertainty on PDFs, especially in the presence of tension in the fitted data sets. We further show how this statistical model reduces to the usual chi-squared likelihood function for a consistent data set and provide measures to optimize the number of Gaussians in the GMM.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr) yields state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of machine learning tasks at the Large Hadron Collider. L-GATr represents data in a geometric algebra over space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations. The underlying architecture is a versatile and scalable transformer, which is able to break symmetries if needed. We demonstrate the power of L-GATr for amplitude regression and jet classification, and then benchmark it as the first Lorentz-equivariant generative network. For all three LHC tasks, we find significant improvements over previous architectures.</description>

      <title>RI-(S)MOM to $\overline{\rm MS}$ conversion for $B_K$ at two-loop order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kaon bag parameter $ {\hat{B}}_K $ plays a critical role in constraining the parameters of the CKM matrix and in probing physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we improve the precision of $ \hat{B}_K $ to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and provide world averages for both $3$- and $4$-flavour theories. In the course of this, as our main technical development, we carry out the two-loop matching between the RI-(S)MOM and $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ schemes. Our world averages combine all available lattice data, including conversion between the 3- and 4-flavour theories as appropriate. We obtain the result $\hat B_{K}^{(f=3)} = 0.7627(60)$, which comprises the complete set of $3$- and $4$-flavour lattice results and can be used directly in phenomenological applications. The error is dominated by lattice uncertainties and missing higher-order corrections (residual scale dependence). Our averages include a PDG rescaling factor of 1.28 reflecting a mild tension among the lattice inputs after inclusion of NNLO corrections in the scheme conversion and matching across flavour thresholds. Our averages imply an updated value $|\epsilon_K|=2.171(65)_\text{pert.}(71)_\text{non-pert.}(153)_\text{param.} \times 10^{-3}$. We briefly discuss applications of our results to $D$-meson mixing.</description>

      <title>Realization of electroweak baryogenesis by fourth generation fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the electroweak baryogenesis can be realized in the extended Standard Model with sequential fourth generation fermions (SM4). The solution to the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the fermion and Higgs masses indicates that fourth generation quarks $t'$ and $b'$ with the Yukawa couplings above the threshold $g_Q^c\approx 9.1$ form condensates. This critical coupling, greater than the value $g_Y^f\approx 7$ at the ultraviolet fixed point of the renormalization-group evolution in the SM4, implies the existence of an electroweak symmetric phase at a high energy. The $t'$ and $b'$ Yukawa couplings evolve as the energy decreases, and exceed $g_Q^c$ at a lower scale. The Higgs potential with the dynamical symmetry breaking effect from heavy quark condensates plus the one-loop temperature-dependent correction from the heavy scalars formed by $t'$ and $b'$ quarks allow the first-order phase transition characterized by the ratio $\phi_c/T_c\approx 0.9$, where $\phi_c$ is the location of the Higgs potential minimum at the critical temperature $T_c$. Together with the baryon number violating sphaleron interaction inherent in the Standard Model and the enhanced $CP$ violation source from fourth generation quarks, the baryon asymmetry in the Universe can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than the marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively present a model-independent inequality for the $95\%$ upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when the resonance peaks during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>

Abstract: We present a discovery-era strategy for Intensity Frontier experiments based on ``di-decay'' events, in which feebly interacting particles (FIPs) are produced in pairs and then both decay inside the detector. This signature may exist in broad classes of models with FIPs decaying in the same way as minimal ``portal'' particles. The two displaced vertices allow reconstruction of the pair invariant mass and hence reveal the production channel, information normally inaccessible at these facilities. This, in turn, lets one discriminate between FIP models that share identical decay signatures. As a case study, we consider the model of Higgs-like scalars and show that SHiP, Belle II, and the Downstream@LHCb can each cover wide domains of viable parameter space using di-decays.</description>

      <title>Probes of Anomalous Events at LHC with Self-Organizing Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), built on a neural network architecture, for the probe of a rare top decay, mediated by Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC), to charm and the Higgs boson, with the Higgs boson further decaying to a pair of b-quarks or a pair of gauge bosons ($W^{\pm}/Z$) in a boosted regime. Ideally, the particles originating from the decay of the boosted top lead to the reconstruction of a large-R jet, comprising three-prong substructures, with b- and c-tagged subjets. The SOM algorithm has been demonstrated as a model-agnostic anomaly-finder for probing the rare decay at the LHC, by mapping distinct signal and background regions to separate non-overlapping clusters on the Kohnen map. This helps to identify signal regions with higher signal significances. We also discuss the robustness of this algorithm, especially for other BSM probes with model-agnostic and model-dependent searches.</description>

Abstract: Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter (BBDM) is a novel mechanism whereby dark matter (DM) particles are accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies through interactions with blazar jets. Focusing on a vector portal DM model, we systematically investigate both elastic and inelastic scattering processes between DM and protons. By analyzing multi-messenger data from ground- and space-based observatories, we derive stringent constraints on the DM-proton scattering cross section $\sigma_{\chi p}$. Our results improve upon previous limits from the constant cross section and pure elastic scattering scenarios by several orders of magnitude. The distinctive high-energy gamma ray and neutrino fluxes produced through deep inelastic scattering provide powerful signatures for BBDM indirect detection, enabling constraints that significantly surpass those from traditional direct detection experiments. Notably, our results suggest that DM could be a new source of high-energy neutrinos from blazars, potentially offering an explanation for IceCube's observation of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>New physics particles mixing with mesons: production in the fragmentation chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of extensions to the Standard Model adds hypothetical long-lived particles (LLPs) that have mass- or kinetic-mixing with neutral mesons, such as pions or rho mesons. The mixing can contribute significantly to the production of LLPs at proton accelerator experiments, and no consistent description of these production modes exists in the literature. In this paper, we develop a framework for studying different LLPs - dark photons, vector mediators coupled to the baryon current, and axion-like particles with different coupling patterns. In particular, we implement the production mechanisms in \texttt{PYTHIA8}, study how the overall flux and kinematic distributions depend on the LLP's mass, and compare various sub-processes where the mixing contributes - proton bremsstrahlung, meson decay, and production in the fragmentation chain. We find that our new description of LLP production predicts an integrated flux that differs from current approaches by one to two orders of magnitude, and highlight the unavoidable theoretical uncertainties coming from poor knowledge of the properties of heavy mesons.</description>

      <title>Probing fluctuating protons using forward neutrons in soft and hard inelastic proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model for the distribution of the number of forward neutrons emitted in soft (minimum bias) and hard inelastic proton-nucleus ($pA$) scattering at the LHC. It is based on the Gribov-Glauber model for the distribution over the number of inelastic collisions (wounded nucleons) combined with a parametrization of cross section (color) fluctuations in the projectile proton, which depend on the parton momentum fraction $x_p$, and the assumption of independent neutron emissions. We observe that while the effect of soft color fluctuations is modest, a reduction of the interaction strength with increasing $x_p$ provides the dominant effect. It allows us to qualitatively describe the trend of the ATLAS data on the ZDC energy spectra of forward neutrons emitted in dijet production in inelastic $pA$ scattering at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Antinuclei from Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) may have originated in the early Universe, and could contribute to the dark matter in the Universe. Their Hawking evaporation into particles could eventually lead to the production of antinuclei, which propagate and arrive at Earth as cosmic rays with a flux peaked at GeV energies. We revisit here the antiproton and antideuteron signatures from PBH evaporation, relying on a lognormal PBH mass distribution, state-of-the-art propagation models, and an improved coalescence model for fusion into antideuterons. Our predictions are then compared with AMS-02 data on the antiproton flux. We find that the AMS-02 antiproton data severely constrain the Galactic PBH density, setting bounds that depend significantly on the parameters of the lognormal mass distribution, and that are comparable to or slightly stronger than bounds set from diverse messengers. We also discuss prospects for future detection of antideuterons. Given the bounds from AMS-02 antiproton data, we predict that if antideuterons were to be measured by AMS-02 or GAPS, since the secondary contribution is subdominant, they would clearly be a signal of new physics, only part of which could, however, be explained by PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic grand unification in SO(10) with one extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification provides an alternative approach to gradually unify gauge couplings in the UV limit, where they reach a non-trivial UV fixed point. Using an economical and realistic particle content setup, we demonstrate that asymptotic grand unification can be achieved in a 5D SO(10) model with one extra dimension. The top, bottom and tau masses are split, and the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained via inverse seesaw. One intermediate scale, the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale, is included below the compactification scale. Due to the absence of large-dimensional Higgs representations, gauge couplings exhibit asymptotic safety and are thus asymptotically unified, regardless of their initial values. In contrast, Yukawa couplings can achieve asymptotic freedom if the negative gauge contributions dominate over the positive Yukawa terms, requiring exact unification at the compactification scale. The widely-used 126-dimensional Higgs is not recommended in this 5D asymptotic SO(10) GUT, as it tends to drive the gauge beta function positive, compromising asymptotic safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future lepton colliders, such as those based on linear $e^+e^-$ or circular $\mu^+\mu^-$ accelerators, are expected to attain centre-of-mass energies in the multi-TeV range. In this regime the impact of QED and of weak radiation, in both the initial and the final state, can become a leading effect. By employing a general framework presented in a companion paper - suitable for any flavour of colliding leptons - we improve next-to-leading order electroweak predictions by including higher-order contributions, which encompass, but are not limited to, vector-boson-fusion processes. We apply this approach to the study of $t\bar{t}$ and $W^+W^-$ production at a muon collider operating at centre-of-mass energies up to 10 TeV. We show that such an approach, where both QED and weak contributions are included at fixed order, in addition to the all-order resummation of initial-state QED effects, can provide predictions for arbitrary observables in all of the phase space which are precise at the percent level.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings via $ZZ$ Production at $e^+e^-$ Colliders with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) first arise from the dimension-8 operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), rather than the dimension-4 SM Lagrangian and dimension-6 SMEFT operators, opening up a unique window for probing new physics at the dimension-8 level. In this work, we formulate the nTGC form factors of $ZZV^*$ ($V\!\!=\!Z,\gamma$) that are compatible with the spontaneous breaking of the SU(2)$\otimes$U(1) electroweak gauge symmetry and consistently match the dimension-8 nTGC operators in the broken phase. We study the sensitivities for probing both the $ZZV^*$ form factors and the corresponding new physics scales through $ZZ$ production (with visible/invisible fermionic $Z$ decays) at high energy $e^+e^-$ colliders including CEPC, FCC-ee, ILC and CLIC. In particular, we identify the dimension-8 operator that contributes to the pure triple $Z$ boson coupling $ZZZ^*$ alone, but not the mixed $ZZ\gamma^*$ coupling. We further study the correlations between probes of the $ZZZ^*$ and $ZZ\gamma^*$ couplings. Using machine learning, we show that angular distributions of the final-state fermions can play key roles in suppressing the SM backgrounds. The sensitivities can be further improved by using polarized $e^\mp$ beams. We demonstrate that machine learning is advantageous for handling the 4-body final states from $ZZ$ decays and improves significantly the sensitivity reaches of probes of nTGCs in $e^+e^-$ collisions. We find that nTGC new physics scales can be probed up to the multi-TeV scale at the proposed $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino energy reconstruction is crucial for reducing systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments and improving cross-section measurements. Kaon-Decays-At-Rest (KDAR) neutrinos provide a unique opportunity to probe neutrino-nucleus interactions at low energies with a precisely known energy of 235.5 MeV. This work presents Monte Carlo predictions of missing energy due to nuclear effects in the KDAR $\nu_\mu$ charged-current scattering on the carbon nucleus for JSNS$^2$. The predictions from GENIE, NuWro, and GiBUU show a significant impact of nuclear and final state interaction (FSI) models, as well as nucleon removal energy, on missing energy reconstruction. Tuning the hA FSI model improves the predictions from GENIE. It is also observed that the nucleon elastic component of FSI leads to better predictions in NuWro compared to GENIE. NuWro shows the best agreement with data among the generators considered; however, the observed discrepancies with data across all generators highlight the limitations of current theoretical descriptions in the low-energy regime and the need for improvements in Monte Carlo modeling.</description>

Abstract: Precise predictions for Higgs decays are a crucial ingredient of the search for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a valuable tool for quantifying deviations from the Standard Model (SM). We present the complete set of predictions for the 2- and 3- body Higgs decays at next-to-leading order (NLO), considering QCD and electroweak corrections and including all contributions from the dimension-6 SMEFT operators and with an arbitrary flavor structure. Including the NLO SMEFT results for Higgs decays greatly increases the sensitivity to BSM physics of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow Zh$ process at FCC-ee, as compared with that obtained using only the total cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative neutrino mass matrix $m^\nu$ in the Zee model depends on leptonic Yukawa couplings $F$ to a singlet scalar and $Y^\ell$ to a new Higgs doublet. Leveraging the skew-symmetric structure of $F$, we derive a unique identity linking $F$ and $m^\nu$ that is explicitly independent of $Y^\ell$. This relation implies that five entries of $Y^\ell$ can, in principle, be determined directly from $m^\nu$ and $F$, while the remaining four can be selected based on phenomenological assumptions. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the two-zero texture $B2$, highlighting its enhancement of the muon $g-2$.</description>

Abstract: Investigation of neutrino spin oscillation in the gravitational fields of black holes (BHs) is one of the interesting topics in neutrino physics. On the other hand, in recent years, many studies have been devoted to the exploration of different physical phenomena in higher dimensions. Non-commutative geometry has also been focus of researchers in recent years to explore the structure of space-time more deeply and accurately. In this work, the neutrino spin oscillation in the non-commutative higher dimensional gravitational fields of Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstrom metrics is studied. The effects of noncommutativity of space are calculated and its role in different dimensions is discussed. Considering the fact that in the non-commutative space, for certain values of eta, no event horizon exists and consequently, there will be no BH, some upper bounds for the non-commutative parameter are obtained.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Gamma-ray and Neutrino Production Following from the Physics of Photon-Nucleon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a more complete consideration of the theoretical concepts and experimental aspects of the physics of photoproduction interactions involving nuclei. This treatment is based in large part on the most recent and extensive empirical data on particle photoproduction interactions with protons. The implications of photoproduction involving helium nuclei are also treated and compared with photoproduction involving protons. It is found that photoproduction interactions with helium nuclei produce approximately 10% of the number of pions as compared with photoproduction interactions involving protons in astrophysical sources, assuming the cosmological abundance of He. In addition to the production of pions, we also demonstrate the relative effect of excited nucleon p-pi and p-2pi resonances and rho, eta, omega, and K meson production and decay channels that result in neutrino and gamma-ray production. The production of mesons other than pions is shown not to be significant for calculations of astrophysical gamma-ray and neutrino production. It is further shown that, for astrophysical purposes, the Delta(1232) resonance channel clearly dominates. However, a blend of nucleon resonances at 1400 GeV can contribute as much as 20% to the neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of $\alpha$-attractors in Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>A new approach to quark mass determination using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine quark masses using ratios of the vacuum-expectation values (VEVs) of flowed quark bilinear operators. They can be expressed as functions of the flow time $t$ and the ${\overline {\rm MS}}$ quark mass $\overline{m}$, which can then be determined by matching with the corresponding lattice results. Motivated by this, we evaluate these VEVs perturbatively through next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We provide the results as expansions in the limits of small and large $\overline{m}^2 t$. To this end, we develop a new expansion technique based on the Laplace transform. Additionally, we present numerical results with the exact mass dependence over a wide range of $\overline{m}^2t$. We discuss the expected perturbative precision for the mass determination based on our next-to-leading order perturbative calculations, and possible non-perturbative corrections.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electron-neutrino lepton number crossings in core-collapse supernovae: A comparison of methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossing. Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$ and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state, while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to be unbound.</description>

      <title>Electron-neutrino lepton number crossings: Variations with the supernova core physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.</description>
