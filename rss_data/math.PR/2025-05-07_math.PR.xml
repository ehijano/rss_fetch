      <title>Convergence rate of Euler-Maruyama scheme to the invariant probability measure under total variation distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article shows the geometric decay rate of Euler-Maruyama scheme for one-dimensional stochastic differential equation towards its invariant probability measure under total variation distance. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of invariant probability measure and the uniform geometric ergodicity of the chain are studied through introduction of non-atomic Markov chains. Secondly, the equivalent conditions for uniform geometric ergodicity of the chain are discovered, by constructing a split Markov chain based on the original Euler-Maruyama scheme. It turns out that this convergence rate is independent with the step size under total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro population dynamics models of benthic algae with long-memory decay and generic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benthic algae, as a primary producer in riverine ecosystems, develop biofilms on the riverbed. Their population dynamics involve growth and decay processes, the former owing to the balance between biological proliferation and mortality, while the latter results from mechanical abrasion because of the transport of sediment particles, such as sand and gravel. The decay has experimentally been identified to exhibit long memory behavior, where the population decreases at an algebraic rate. However, the origin and mathematical theory of this phenomenon remain unresolved. This study introduces a novel mathematical model employing spin processes to describe microscopic biofilm dynamics. The continuum limit of these spin processes captures the long-memory decay and generates generic growth curves. A spin process is defined as a continuous-time stochastic process transitioning between states 0 and 1. The proposed framework leverages heterogeneous spin rates, achieved by superposing spin processes with distinct rates, to reproduce the long-memory decay. Computational simulations demonstrate the behavior of the model, particularly emphasizing rate-induced tipping phenomena. This mathematical model provides a computationally tractable interpretation of benthic algae dynamics, relevant to applications in mathematical modelling.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations and the Peano Phenomenon in Stochastic Differential Equations with Homogeneous Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion equation in $\R^d$ with drift equal to the gradient of a homogeneous potential of degree $1+\gamma$, with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$, and local variance equal to $\ve^2$ with $\ve\to0$. The associated deterministic system for $\ve=0$ has a potential that is not a Lipschitz function at the origin. Therefore, an infinite number of solutions exist, known as the Peano phenomenon. In this work, we study large deviations of first and second order for the system with noise, generalizing previous results for the particular potential $b(x)=x |x|^{\gamma-1}$. For the first-order large deviations, we recover the rate function from the well-known Freidlin-Wentzell work. For the second-order large deviation, we use a refinement of Carmona-Simon bounds for the eigenfunctions of a Schr\"odinger operator and prove that the exponential behavior of the process depends only on the ground state of such an operator. Moreover, a refined study of the ground state allows us to obtain the large deviation rate function explicitly and to deduce that the family of diffusions converges to the set of extreme solutions of the deterministic system.</description>

      <title>A new architecture of high-order deep neural networks that learn martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new deep-learning neural network architecture based on high-order weak approximation algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is proposed. The architecture enables the efficient learning of martingales by deep learning models. The behaviour of deep neural networks based on this architecture, when applied to the problem of pricing financial derivatives, is also examined. The core of this new architecture lies in the high-order weak approximation algorithms of the explicit Runge--Kutta type, wherein the approximation is realised solely through iterative compositions and linear combinations of vector fields of the target SDEs.</description>

      <title>Comparing statistical and deep learning techniques for parameter estimation of continuous-time stochastic differentiable equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process have long been used to model realworld probablistic events such as stock prices and temperature fluctuations. While statistical methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Kalman Filtering, Inverse Variable Method, and more have historically been used to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations, the recent explosion of deep learning technology suggests that models such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) could produce more precise estimators. We present a series of experiments that compare the estimation accuracy and computational expensiveness of a statistical method (MLE) with a deep learning model (RNN) for the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the dynamics of the infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with multiplicative white noise. We derive the effective equation on the approximate slow manifold in detail by utilizing a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) describing the motion of interfaces. In particular, we verify the equivalence between the full SPDE and the coupled system under small stochastic perturbations. Moreover, we apply our results to effective dynamics of stochastic models with multiplicative white noise, illustrated with four examples on the stochastic damped wave equation, the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the stochastic Swift-Hohenberg equation.</description>

      <title>Extended states for the Random Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 5$) with decaying Bernoulli potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the delocalization property of the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_\omega=-\Delta+v_n\omega_n\delta_{n,n'}$, where $v_n=\kappa |n|^{-\alpha}$ and $\omega=\{\omega_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d}\in \{\pm 1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. Under the assumptions of $d\geq 5$, $\alpha&gt;\frac14$ and $0&lt;\kappa\ll1$, we construct the extended states for a deterministic renormalization of $H_\omega$ for most $\omega$. This extends the work of Bourgain [{\it Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis}, LNM 1807: 70--98, 2003], where the case $\alpha&gt;\frac13$ was handled. Our proof is based on Green's function estimates via a $6$th-order renormalization scheme. Among the main new ingredients are the proof of a generalized Khintchine inequality via Bonami's lemma, and the application of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to control a new type of non-random operators arising from the $6$th-order renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study expansion problems on countable structures in the setting of descriptive combinatorics. We consider both expansions on countable Borel equivalence relations and on countable groups, in the Borel, measure and category settings, and establish some basic correspondences between the two notions. We also prove some general structure theorems for measure and category. We then explore in detail many examples, including finding spanning trees in graphs, finding monochromatic sets in Ramsey's Theorem, and linearizing partial orders.</description>

      <title>Time-lagged marginal expected shortfall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marginal expected shortfall (MES) is an important measure when assessing and quantifying the contribution of the financial institution to a systemic crisis. In this paper, we propose time-lagged marginal expected shortfall (TMES) as a dynamic extension of the MES, accounting for time lags in assessing systemic risks. A natural estimator for the TMES is proposed, and its asymptotic properties are studied. To address challenges in constructing confidence intervals for the TMES in practice, we apply the stationary bootstrap method to generate confidence bands for the TMES estimator. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to investigate the asymptotic properties of empirical and bootstrapped TMES. Two practical applications of TMES, supported by real data analyses, effectively demonstrate its ability to account for time lags in risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Modelling the effects of biological intervention in a dynamical gene network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular response to environmental and internal signals can be modeled by dynamical gene regulatory networks (GRN). In the literature, three main classes of gene network models can be distinguished: (i) non-quantitative (or data-based) models which do not describe the probability distribution of gene expressions; (ii) quantitative models which fully describe the probability distribution of all genes coexpression; and (iii) mechanistic models which allow for a causal interpretation of gene interactions. We propose two rigorous frameworks to model gene alteration in a dynamical GRN, depending on whether the network model is quantitative or mechanistic. We explain how these models can be used for design of experiment, or, if additional alteration data are available, for validation purposes or to improve the parameter estimation of the original model. We apply these methods to the Gaussian graphical model, which is quantitative but non-mechanistic, and to mechanistic models of Bayesian networks and penalized linear regression.</description>

Abstract: Let $Q^d$ be the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube. We form a random subgraph $Q^d_p\subseteq Q^d$ by retaining each edge of $Q^d$ independently with probability $p$. We show that, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C=C(\varepsilon)&gt;0$ such that, if $p\ge C/d$, then with high probability $Q^d_p$ contains a cycle of length at least $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$. This confirms a long-standing folklore conjecture, stated in particular by Condon, Espuny D\'iaz, Gir\~ao, K\"uhn, and Osthus [Hamiltonicity of random subgraphs of the hypercube, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 305 (2024), No. 1534].</description>

      <title>Accelerated escape dynamics in non-Markovian stochastic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximation of the Burgers and Keller-Segel equations by moderately interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.03177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we obtain rates of convergence for two moderately interacting stochastic particle systems with singular kernels associated to the viscous Burgers and Keller-Segel equations.
  The main novelty of this work is to consider a non-locally integrable kernel. Namely for the viscous Burgers equation in $\mathbb{R}$, we obtain almost sure convergence of the mollified empirical measure to the solution of the PDE in some Bessel space with a rate of convergence of order $N^{-1/6}$, on any time interval. With the same rate, convergence also holds for the genuine empirical measure in Wasserstein distance, and at the level of the trajectories of the particles with the standard coupling to McKean-Vlasov particles.
  In the case of the Keller-Segel equation on a $d$-dimensional torus, we obtain almost sure convergence of the mollified empirical measure to the solution of the PDE in some $L^q$ space with a rate of order $N^{-\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$. The result holds up to the maximal existence time of the PDE, for any value of the chemo-attractant sensitivity $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Competing types in preferential attachment graphs with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the two-type preferential attachment model of Antunovi\'c, Mossel and R\'acz, where each new vertex takes its type according to a defined rule based on the types of its neighbours, to incorporate community structure, and investigate whether the proportions of vertices of each type synchronise between communities. The behaviour depends both on the choice of community structure and on the type assignment rule.
  For essentially all cases where the single community model has more than one possible limit, communities may fail to synchronise for weakly interacting communities. Even when the single community model almost surely converges to a deterministic limit, synchronisation is not guaranteed. However, we give natural conditions on the assignment rule and, for two communities, on the structure, either of which will imply synchronisation to this limit, and each of which is essentially best possible.
  We also give an example where the proportions of types almost surely do not converge, which is impossible in the single community model.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called polynomial ensembles and its subclass P\'olya ensembles. This latter subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the eigenvalue (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>

      <title>Boundary behavior at infinity for simple exchangeable fragmentation-coagulation process in critical slow regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a critical simple exchangeable fragmentation-coagulation process in slow regime where the coagulation rate and fragmentation rate are of the same order, we show that there exist phase transitions for its boundary behavior at infinity depending on the asymptotics of the difference between the two rates, and find rather sharp conditions for different boundary behaviors.</description>

      <title>Extremal negative dependence and the strongly Rayleigh property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a geometrical characterization of extremal negative dependence as a convex polytope in the simplex of multidimensional Bernoulli distributions, and we prove that it is an antichain that satisfies some minimality conditions with respect to the strongest negative dependence orders. We study the strongly Rayleigh property within this class and explicitly find a distribution that satisfies this property by maximizing the entropy. Furthermore, we construct a chain for the supermodular order starting from extremal negative dependence to independence by mixing the maximum entropy strongly Rayleigh distribution with independence.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of tempered stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>A Resolution of the McCarty Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The McCarty Conjecture states that any McCarty Matrix (an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with positive integer entries and each of the $2n$ row and column sums equal to $n$), can be additively decomposed into two other matrices, $B$ and $C$, such that $B$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{1, 2,... n\}$, and $C$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{0, 1,... n-1\}$. The problem can also be formulated in terms of bipartite graphs. In this paper we use probabilistic methods to resolve this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.</description>
