      <title>Machine Learning-based Search of High-redshift Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning search for high-redshift ($5.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.5$) quasars using the combined photometric data from the DESI Imaging Legacy Surveys and the WISE survey. We explore the imputation of missing values for high-redshift quasars, discuss the feature selections, compare different machine learning algorithms, and investigate the selections of class ensemble for the training sample, then we find that the random forest model is very effective in separating the high-redshift quasars from various contaminators. The 11-class random forest model can achieve a precision of $96.43\%$ and a recall of $91.53\%$ for high-redshift quasars for the test set. We demonstrate that the completeness of the high-redshift quasars can reach as high as $82.20\%$. The final catalog consists of 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates with 476 high probable ones in the entire Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, and we make the catalog publicly available. Using MUSE and DESI-EDR public spectra, we find that 14 true high-redshift quasars (11 in the training sample) out of 21 candidates are correctly identified for MUSE, and 20 true high-redshift quasars (11 in the training sample) out of 21 candidates are correctly identified for DESI-EDR. Additionally, we estimate photometric redshift for the high-redshift quasar candidates using random forest regression model with a high precision.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy clusters CARLA J0950+2743 at z=2.363, and CARLA-Ser J0950+2743 at z=2.243</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, being the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, are a powerful tool to study mass assembly at different epochs. At z$&gt;$2 they give an unique opportunity to put solid constraints not only on dark matter halo growth, but also on the mechanisms of galaxy quenching and morphological transformation when the Universe was younger than 3.3 Gyr. However, the currently available sample of confirmed $z&gt;2$ clusters remains very limited. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy cluster CARLA J0950+2743 at $z=2.363\pm0.005$ and a new serendipitously discovered cluster, CARLA-Ser J0950+2743 at $z=2.243\pm0.008$ in the same region. We confirm eight star-forming galaxies in the first cluster, and five in the second by detecting [OII], [OIII] and $H\alpha$ emission lines. The analysis of a serendipitous X-ray observation of this field from Chandra reveals a counterpart with a total luminosity of $L_{0.5-5 keV} = 2.9\pm0.6\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Given the limited depth of the X-ray observations, we cannot distinguish the 1-D profile of the source from a PSF model, however, our statistical analysis of the 2-D profile favors an extended component that could be associated to a thermal contribution from the intra-cluster medium (ICM). If the extended X-ray emission is due to the hot ICM, the total dark matter mass for the two clusters would be $M_{200}=3.30 ^{+0.23}_{-0.26 (\mathrm{stat})}$ $^{+1.28}_{-0.96 (\mathrm{sys})} \times10^{14} M_{\odot}$. This makes our two clusters interesting targets for studies of the structure growth in the cosmological context. However, future investigations would require deeper high-resolution X-ray and spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>The structural properties of nearby dwarf galaxies in low density environments -- size, surface brightness and colour gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a complete sample of 211 nearby (z&lt;0.08) dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; Mstar &lt; 10^9.5 Msun) galaxies in low-density environments, to study their structural properties: effective radii (R_e), effective surface brightnesses (mu_e) and colour gradients. We explore these properties as a function of stellar mass and the three principal dwarf morphological types identified in a companion paper (Lazar et al.) -- early-type galaxies (ETGs), late-type galaxies (LTGs) and featureless systems. The median R_e of LTGs and featureless galaxies are factors of ~2 and ~1.2 larger than the ETGs. While the median mu_e of the ETGs and LTGs is similar, the featureless class is ~1 mag arcsec^-2 fainter. Although they have similar median R_e, the featureless and ETG classes differ significantly in their median mu_e, suggesting that their evolution is different and that the featureless galaxies are not a subset of the ETGs. While massive ETGs typically exhibit negative or flat colour gradients, dwarf ETGs generally show positive colour gradients (bluer centres). The growth of ETGs therefore changes from being `outside-in' to `inside-out' as we move from the dwarf to the massive regime. The colour gradients of dwarf and massive LTGs are, however, similar. Around 46 per cent of dwarf ETGs show prominent, visually-identifiable blue cores which extend out to ~1.5 R_e. Finally, compared to their non-interacting counterparts, interacting dwarfs are larger, bluer at all radii and exhibit similar median mu_e, indicating that interactions typically enhance star formation across the entire galaxy.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter profiles in FIRE dwarfs: black holes, cosmic rays and the cusp-core enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies have historically posed challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model and, while many of the so-called 'dwarf galaxy problems' have been mitigated by incorporating baryonic processes, the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves remains a contentious topic. Meanwhile, the growing observational samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies have prompted a paradigm shift in our understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution, traditionally thought to be regulated by stellar feedback. In this study, we explore the potential role of AGN feedback in shaping dark matter distributions and increasing the diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves, using a new suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the FIRE-3 model. Our findings indicate that the presence of active black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can lead to diverse outcomes, ranging from cuspier to more core-like profiles. This variability arises from the dual role of BHs in providing additional feedback and regulating the extent of stellar feedback. Consistent with previous research, we find that AGN feedback is most impactful when cosmic ray (CR) modelling is included, with CRs from any source significantly influencing dark matter profiles. Overall, our results highlight that the interplay between stellar feedback, BHs, and CRs produces a broad spectrum of dark matter density profiles, which align with observed correlations between rotation curve shapes and baryonic dominance. This underscores the importance of including the full range of baryonic processes in dwarf galaxy simulations to address the persistent 'small-scale challenges' to the CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Metal line emission around z&lt;1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize, for the first time, the average extended emission in multiple lines ([OII], [OIII], and Hbeta) around a statistical sample of 560 galaxies at z~0.25-0.85. By stacking the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) 3D data from two large surveys, the MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) and the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), we detect significant [OII] emission out to ~40 kpc, while [OIII] and Hbeta emission is detected out to ~30 kpc. Via comparisons with the nearby average stellar continuum emission, we find that the line emission at 20-30 kpc likely arises from the disk-halo interface. Combining our results with that of our previous study at z~1, we find that the average [OII] surface brightness increases independently with redshift over z~0.4-1.3 and with stellar mass over M* ~10^{6-12} Msun, which is likely driven by the star formation rate as well as the physical conditions of the gas. By comparing the observed line fluxes with photoionization models, we find that the ionization parameter declines with distance, going from log q (cm/s) ~7.7 at &lt;=5 kpc to ~7.3 at 20-30 kpc, which reflects a weaker radiation field in the outer regions of galaxies. The gas-phase metallicity shows no significant variation over 30 kpc, with a metallicity gradient of ~0.003 dex/kpc, which indicates an efficient mixing of metals on these scales. Alternatively, there could be a significant contribution from shocks and diffuse ionized gas to the line emission in the outer regions.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Growth of Bright Central Galaxies and Intracluster Light as Traced by the Magnitude Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a sample of 2800 galaxy clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey across the redshift range $0.20 &lt; z &lt; 0.60$, we characterize the hierarchical assembly of Bright Central Galaxies (BCGs) and the surrounding intracluster light (ICL). To quantify hierarchical formation we use the stellar mass - halo mass (SMHM) relation for the BCG+ICL system and incorporate the magnitude gap (M14), the difference in brightness between the BCG (measured within 30kpc) and 4th brightest cluster member galaxy within 0.5 $R_{200,c}$. The inclusion of M14, which traces BCG hierarchical growth, increases the slope and decreases the intrinsic scatter in the SMHM relation, highlighting that it is a latent variable within the BCG+ICL SMHM relation. Moreover, the correlation with M14 decreases at large radii from the BCG's centre. However, the stellar light within the BCG+ICL transition region (30kpc - 80kpc) most strongly correlates with the dark matter halo mass and has a statistically significant correlation with M14. As the light in the transition region and M14 are independent measurements, the transition region may grow as a result of the BCG's hierarchical two-phase formation. Additionally, as M14 and ICL result from hierarchical growth, we use a stacked sample and find that clusters with large M14 values are characterized by larger ICL and BCG+ICL fractions, which illustrates that the merger processes that build the BCG stellar mass also grow the ICL. Furthermore, this may suggest that M14 combined with the ICL fraction can be used as a method to identify dynamically relaxed clusters.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clustering in a new implementation of the GAEA semi-analytical galaxy formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation coupled with merger trees extracted from the P-Millennium Simulation (PMS), which provides a better mass resolution, a larger volume and assumes cosmological parameters consistent with latest results from the Planck mission. The model includes, at the same time, a treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular (H$_2$) components; a better treatment for environmental processes acting on satellite galaxies; an updated modelling of cold gas accretion on Super-Massive Black Hole and relative AGN feedback on the host galaxy. We compare GAEA predictions based on the PMS, with model realizations based on other simulations in the Millennium Suite at different resolution, showing that the new model provides a remarkable consistency in the statistical properties of galaxy populations. We interpret this as due to the interplay between AGN feedback and H$_2$-based SFR (both acting as regulators of the cold gas content). We then compare model predictions with available data for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF) in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;3. We show that GAEA runs are able to correctly recover the main dependencies of the 2pCF as a function of stellar mass (M$_\star$), star formation activity, HI-content and redshift for M$_\star$ &lt; 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies. Our model correctly captures both the distribution of galaxy populations in the Large Scale Structure and the interplay between the main physical processes regulating their baryonic content, both for central and satellite galaxies. At larger stellar masses GAEA underpredicts the 2pCF amplitude, suggesting that model massive galaxies live in less massive dark matter haloes. The model predicts a rather small redshift evolution of the clustering amplitude up to z$\sim$3, consistent with available observational evidence.</description>

      <title>A Physically Motivated Framework to Compare Merger Timescales of Isolated Low- and High-Mass Galaxy Pairs Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger timescales of isolated low-mass pairs ($\rm 10^8&lt;M_*&lt;5\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$) on cosmologically motivated orbits have not yet been studied in detail, though isolated high-mass pairs ($\rm 5\times10^9&lt;M_*&lt;10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) have been studied extensively. It is common to apply the same separation criteria and expected merger timescales of high-mass pairs to low-mass systems, however, it is unclear if their merger timescales are similar, or if they evolve similarly with redshift. We use the Illustris TNG100 simulation to quantify the merger timescales of isolated low-mass and high-mass major pairs as a function of cosmic time, and explore how different selection criteria impact the mass and redshift dependence of merger timescales. In particular, we present a physically-motivated framework for selecting pairs via a scaled separation criteria, wherein pair separations are scaled by the virial radius of the primary's FoF group halo ($r_{\mathrm{sep}}&lt; 1 R_{vir}$). Applying these scaled separation criteria yields equivalent merger timescales for both mass scales at all redshifts. Alternatively, static physical separation selections applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs at all redshifts leads to a difference in merger rates of up to $\rm \sim 1\, Gyr$ between low- and high-mass pairs, particularly for $\rm r_{sep}&lt;150\, kpc$. As a result, applying the same merger timescales to physical separation-selected pairs will lead to a bias that systematically over-predicts low-mass galaxy merger rates.</description>

      <title>Internal Dynamics of Multiple Populations in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters: A Wide-Field study with Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) across a wide field of view, extending from the innermost regions to the clusters' outskirts. Using astro-photometric catalogs from ground-based observations, Gaia, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify first- (1P) and second-population (2P) stars, and study the internal dynamics of MPs using high-precision Gaia DR3 and HST proper motions. Our results reveal that while the 1P transitions from isotropy to slight tangential anisotropy toward the outer regions, 2P stars become increasingly radially anisotropic beyond the half-light radius. We also explore the connection between the dynamics of MPs and the clusters' structural and dynamical properties, finding statistically significant differences in the anisotropy profiles of dynamically young and non-relaxed clusters, particularly beyond the 1-2 half-light radii. In these regions, 1P stars transition from isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic motion, while 2P stars become more radially anisotropic. In contrast, dynamically older clusters, with mixed MPs, exhibit weaker relative differences. Furthermore, clusters with orbits closer to the Galactic center exhibit larger dynamical differences between 1P and 2P stars than those with larger peri-Galactic radii. These findings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars form in a more centrally concentrated environment, where the interaction with the Milky Way tidal field plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of MPs, especially of 1P.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Open Cluster Chemical Homogeneity using APOGEE and Milky Way Mapper Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about ISM pollution and gas-mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV APOGEE DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3${\sigma}$ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ~0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.</description>

      <title>The redshift evolution of galactic bar pattern speed in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the redshift evolution of the galactic bar properties, like the bar length, pattern speed, and bar fraction, has been investigated for simulated galaxies at stellar masses $M_*&gt;10^{10}\, M_{\odot}$ in the cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation TNG50. We focus on the redshift evolution of the bar pattern speeds and \textit{the fast bar tension}. We show that the median value of the pattern speed of the bars increases as the redshift grows. On the other hand, although the median value of the bar length increases over time, the ratio between the corotation radius and the bar radius, namely the $\mathcal{R}=R_{\text{CR}}/R_{\text{bar}}$ parameter, increases as well. In other words, the corotation radius increases with a higher rate compared to the bar length. This directly means that galactic bars slow down with time, or equivalently as the redshift declines. We discuss the possible mechanisms that reduce the pattern speeds in TNG50. We demonstrate that while mergers can have a significant impact on a galaxy's pattern speed, they do not play a crucial role in the overall evolution of mean pattern speed within the redshift range $z\leq 1.0$. Furthermore, we show that the $\mathcal{R}$ parameter does not correlate with the gas fraction. Consequently, the existence of gas in TNG50 does not alleviate the fast bar tension. We show that the mean value of the pattern speed, computed for all the galaxies irrespective of their mass, at $z=1.0$ is $\Omega_p=70.98\pm 2.34$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and reduces to $\Omega_p=33.65 \pm 1.07$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.0$. This is a direct prediction by TNG50 that bars at $z=1.0$ rotate faster by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared to bars at $z=0.0$.</description>

      <title>Astrochemistry on Galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of observations towards different environments in the Milky Way, as well as theoretical and experimental works, are improving our knowledge of the astrochemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this chapter we report some of the main projects to study the chemical complexity and isotopic ratios across the Galaxy. High-sensitivity spectral surveys covering broad bandwidths towards Galactic Center molecular clouds (e.g. G+0.693-0.027) and star-forming regions (e.g. the hot core G31.41+0.31) are revealing very rich astrochemical reservoirs, which include molecules of prebiotic interest. At the same time, isotopic ratios (e.g. $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N) can give important information on the Galactic chemical evolution, as well as on chemical local processes due to the physical conditions of the molecular clouds. We also highlight the role of cosmic rays as a key agent affecting the interstellar chemistry described above.</description>

      <title>Accretion vs. Core-Filament Collision: Implications for Streamer Formation in Per-emb-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.</description>

      <title>Reply to Comment on "A slightly oblate dark matter halo revealed by a retrograde precessing Galactic disk warp"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this reply, we present a comprehensive analysis addressing the concerns raised by Dehnen et al. (2024) regarding our recent measurement of the disk warp precession using the `motion-picture' method (Huang et al. 2024). We carefully examine the impact of ignoring the twist of the disk warp and the so-called $R$-$\tau$ correlation on the estimation of the precession rate. The results indicate that the effect is minor and does not exceed the systematic and statistical uncertainties. Using N-body+SPH simulation data, we confirm that the `motion-picture' technique is effective in measuring retrograde precession of disk warp in stellar populations younger than 170 Myr, similar to classical Cepheids. Therefore, the overall conclusions of Huang et al. (2024) remain robust.</description>

      <title>Properties of Central Regions of the Dark Matter Halos in the Model with a Bump in the Power Spectrum of Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surprisingly large number of galaxies with masses of $\sim10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z\geq9$ are discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope. A possible explanation for the increase in the mass function can be the presence of a local maximum (bump) in the power spectrum of density perturbations on the corresponding scale. In this paper, it is shown that simultaneously with the growth of the mass function, galaxies from the bump region must have a higher density (compactness) compared to cosmological models without a bump. These more compact galaxies have been partially included in larger galaxies and have been subjected to tidal gravitational disruption. They have been less destructed than ``ordinary'' galaxies of the same mass, and some of them could survive to $z = 0$ and persist on the periphery of some galaxies. The formation and evolution of compact halos in a cube with a volume of $(47 \,\text{Mpc})^3$ with $(1024)^3$ dark matter particles in the redshift range from 120 to 0 have been numerically simulated and observational implications of the presence of such galaxies in the current Universe have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the origin of early-type dwarfs: The spectrophotometric study of CGCG014-074</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type dwarf galaxies constitute a prevalent population in the central regions of rich groups and clusters in the local Universe. These low-luminosity and low-mass stellar systems play a fundamental role in the assembly of the luminous galaxies observed today, according to the $\Lambda$CDM hierarchical theory. The origin of early-type dwarfs has been linked to the transformation of disk galaxies interacting with the intracluster medium, especially in dense environments. However, the existence of low-luminosity early-type galaxies in low-density environments presents a challenge to this scenario. This study presents a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the early-type dwarf galaxy CGCG014-074 using deep GEMINI+GMOS data, focusing on its peculiarities and evolutionary implications. CGCG014-074 exhibits distinct features, including a rotating inner disk, an extended stellar formation with a quiescent phase since about 2 Gyr ago, and the presence of boxy isophotes. From the kinematic analysis, we confirm CGCG014-074 as a nucleated early-type dwarf galaxy with embedded disk. The study of its stellar population parameters using different methods provides significant insights into the galaxy's evolutionary history. These results show an old and metal-poor nucleus ($\sim 9.3$ Gyr and $\mathrm{[Z/H]}\sim-0.84$ dex), while the stellar disk is younger ($\sim4.4$ Gyr) with a higher metallicity ($\mathrm{[Z/H]}\sim-0.40$ dex). These distinctive features collectively position CGCG014-074 as a likely building block galaxy that has evolved passively throughout its history.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition regime: Spatially-segregated structure of compressive MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process that emerges in multiple areas of modern physics, and in ionized environments such as interstellar gas, the magnetic field can be dynamically important. However, the exact function of the magnetic field in the ionized gas remains unclear. We use the $M_{\rm A} = \sqrt{E_{\rm k}/E_B}
  $ to describe the importance of the magnetic field measured to the turbulent motion, and reveal diverse ways of mutual interaction. At low $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic regime), the magnetic field is well-described as force-free. Despite the strong magnetic field, the motion of gas does not stay aligned with the magnetic field. At the regime of intermediate $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), the velocity field and the magnetic field exhibit the highest degree of alignment, which is likely the result of a rapid relaxation. At high $M_{\rm A}$ (kinetic regime), both the magnetic field and the velocity field are irregular, with no alignment. We find observational counterparts to these regimes in observations of interstellar gas. The results highlight the diverse behavior of gas in MHD turbulence and guide future interpretations of the role of the magnetic field in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>High resolution observations of 12CO and 13CO(3--2) toward the NGC 6334 extended filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 6334 is a giant molecular cloud complex with elongated filamentary structure, harbouring OB-stars, HII regions and star forming clumps. To study the emission and velocity structure of the gas in the extended NGC 6334 region, we made observations of the 12CO and 13CO (J=3-2) lines with the APEX telescope. The data provides a spatial resolution of 20 arcsec (~0.16 pc) and sensitivity of ~0.4 K at a spectral resolution of 0.25 km/s. Our observations reveal in the extended NGC 6334 region a connected velocity coherent structure of ~-3.9 km/s over ~80 pc parallel to the galactic plane. The NGC 6334 complex has two connected velocity structures at velocities ~ -9.2 km/s (the bridge features) and ~-20 km/s (the Northern Filament, NGC 6334-NF). We observed local velocity fluctuations at smaller spatial scales along the filament tracing local density enhancement and infall. We investigated the 13CO emission and velocity structure around HII regions and found that most HII regions show signs of molecular gas dispersal from the center and intensity enhancement at their outer radii. Overall NGC 6334 exhibits sequential star formation from west to east. Located in the west, the GM-24 region exhibits bubbles within bubbles and is at a relatively evolved stage of star formation. The NGC 6334 central ridge is undergoing global gas infall and exhibits two gas bridge features possibly connected to the cloud-cloud collision scenario of the NGC 6334-NF and the NGC 6334 main gas component. The relatively quiescent eastern filament (EF1 - G352.1) is a hub-filament in formation which shows the kinematic signature of global gas infall onto the filament. Our observations highlight the important role of H II regions in shaping the molecular gas emission and velocity structure as well as the overall evolution of the molecular filaments in NGC 6334.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in NGC 1399 using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range $10^2-10^5$ solar masses in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3-hour observation of 77 globular cluster candidates using the Square Kilometer Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from $2.93 \times 10^{3.0\pm 0.39}$ to $7.43 \times 10^{4.0 \pm 0.39}$ solar masses, and the empirical fundamental-plane relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with $3.41\times 10^{5.0 \pm 0.96}$ solar masses. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in globular clusters, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. We now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions years after a nearby tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), undergoing instabilities or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs, and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 hours from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically-selected TDE. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet and optical emission from the accretion disk, and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.</description>

Abstract: This study outlines a detailed investigation using CCD {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia} DR3 data sets of the two open clusters Ruprecht 1 (Rup-1) and Ruprecht 171 (Rup-171). Fundamental astrophysical parameters such as color excesses, photometric metallicities, ages, and isochrone distances were based on {\it UBV}-data analyses, whereas membership probability calculations, structural and astrophysical parameters, as well as the kinematic analyses were based on {\it Gaia} DR3-data. We identified 74 and 596 stars as the most probable cluster members with membership probabilities over 50\% for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. The color excesses $E(B-V)$ were obtained as $0.166\pm0.022$ and $0.301\pm0.027$ mag for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Photometric metallicity analyses were performed by considering F-G type main-sequence member stars and found to be [Fe/H]=$-0.09\pm 0.16$ and [Fe/H]=$-0.20\pm 0.20$ dex for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Ages and distances were based on both {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia}-data analyses; according to isochrone-fitting these values were estimated to be $t=580\pm60$ Myr, $d=1469\pm57$ pc for Rup-1 and $t=2700\pm200$ Myr, $d=1509\pm69$ pc for Rup-171. The present-day mass function slope of Rup-1 was estimated as $1.26\pm0.32$ and Rup-171 as $1.53\pm1.49$. Galactic orbit integration analyses showed that both of the clusters might be formed outside the solar circle.</description>

      <title>FLORAH: A generative model for halo assembly histories</title>

Abstract: The mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos plays a crucial role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies. MAHs are used extensively in semi-analytic and empirical models of galaxy formation, yet current analytic methods to generate them are inaccurate and unable to capture their relationship with the halo internal structure and large-scale environment. This paper introduces FLORAH, a machine-learning framework for generating assembly histories of ensembles of dark matter halos. We train FLORAH on the assembly histories from the GUREFT and VSMDPL N-body simulations and demonstrate its ability to recover key properties such as the time evolution of mass and concentration. We obtain similar results for the galaxy stellar mass versus halo mass relation and its residuals when we run the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model on FLORAH-generated assembly histories and halo formation histories extracted from an N-body simulation. We further show that FLORAH also reproduces the dependence of clustering on properties other than mass (assembly bias), which is not captured by other analytic methods. By combining multiple networks trained on a suite of simulations with different redshift ranges and mass resolutions, we are able to construct accurate main progenitor branches (MPBs) with a wide dynamic mass range from $z=0$ up to an ultra-high redshift $z \approx 20$, currently far beyond that of a single N-body simulation. FLORAH is the first step towards a machine learning-based framework for planting full merger trees; this will enable the exploration of different galaxy formation scenarios with great computational efficiency at unprecedented accuracy.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Modeling of Barred S0 Galaxy NGC 4371</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the barred Schwarzschild method developed by Tahmasebzadeh et al. (2022) to a barred S0 galaxy, NGC 4371, observed by IFU instruments from the TIMER and ATLAS3D projects. We construct the gravitational potential by combining a fixed black hole mass, a spherical dark matter halo, and stellar mass distribution deprojected from $3.6$ $\mu$m S$^4$G image considering an axisymmetric disk and a triaxial bar. We independently modelled kinematic data from TIMER and ATLAS3D. Both models fit the data remarkably well. We find a consistent bar pattern speed from the two sets of models with $\Omega_{\rm p} = 23.6 \pm 2.8 \hspace{.08cm} \mathrm{km \hspace{.04cm} s^{-1} \hspace{.04cm} kpc^{-1} }$ and $\Omega_{\rm p} = 22.4 \pm 3.5 \hspace{.08cm} \mathrm{km \hspace{.04cm} s^{-1} \hspace{.04cm} kpc^{-1} }$, respectively. The dimensionless bar rotation parameter is determined to be $ 1.88 \pm 0.37$, indicating a likely slow bar in NGC 4371. Additionally, our model predicts a high amount of dark matter within the bar region ($M_{\rm DM}/ M_{\rm total}$ $\sim 0.51 \pm 0.06$), which, aligned with the predictions of cosmological simulations, indicates that fast bars are generally found in baryon-dominated disks. Based on the best-fitting model, we further decompose the galaxy into multiple 3D orbital structures, including a BP/X bar, a classical bulge, a nuclear disk, and a main disk. The BP/X bar is not perfectly included in the input 3D density model, but BP/X-supporting orbits are picked through the fitting to the kinematic data. This is the first time a real barred galaxy has been modelled utilizing the Schwarzschild method including a 3D bar.</description>

      <title>EIGER VI. The Correlation Function, Host Halo Mass and Duty Cycle of Luminous Quasars at $z\gtrsim6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect luminous ($M_{1450}\lesssim-26.5$) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest density peaks in the early universe. Here, we present observations of four $z\gtrsim6$ quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in imaging and widefield slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [OIII]-emitting galaxies in the quasars' environments, ranging between a density enhancement of $\delta\approx65$ within a $2$ cMpc radius - one of the largest proto-clusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date - to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy auto-correlation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at $\langle z\rangle=6.25$ of $r_0^{\rm QQ}=22.0^{+3.0}_{-2.9}~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$, while we obtain a correlation length of the [OIII]-emitting galaxies of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.1\pm0.3~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$. By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars' host dark matter halos to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}/M_\odot)=12.43^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$ (and $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}^{\rm [OIII]}/M_\odot) = 10.56^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ for the [OIII]-emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is $f_{\rm duty}\ll1$. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.</description>

      <title>The effect of local photoionization on the galaxy properties and the circumgalactic medium in simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of local stellar radiation in cosmological zoom simulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. We include the radiation field as an additional feedback component that is computed alongside gravity with a tree code in an optically thin approximation. We resimulate the initial conditions of five Milk Way-like systems taken from the Auriga project with and without stellar radiation, and study the effects of local stellar radiation on several properties of the galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Similar to previous findings, we observe with our current model that local stellar radiation can modify gas cooling in the CGM and thus suppress star formation and the surface densities of young stars and HI gas, while having little impact on the total gas content. In particular, it also suppresses the peak of the rotation curve and reduces the mass of the stellar bulge. In the CGM region, the young stellar radiation exceeds the external UVB and dominates the radiation field within the virial halo at all redshifts. Nevertheless, we find that the local stellar radiation, as implemented in the current study, has overall little impact on the radial density and temperature profile of the CGM gas. However, for the ion species HI and MgII the column densities within $\sim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$ are reduced, while the OVI column density is hardly impacted by the radiation field due to a lack of soft X-ray components in our current model. Additional effects can be expected from the radiation of the central AGN during phases of quasar activity and from soft X-ray sources, which have not yet been included in the simulations of the present study.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluated the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Not-so-little Red Dots: Two massive and dusty starbursts at z~5-7 pushing the limits of star formation discovered by JWST in the COSMOS-Web survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the properties of two candidate massive ($M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) and dusty ($A_{\rm v}&gt;2.5$ mag) galaxies at $z=5-7$ in the first 0.28 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. One object is spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a robust $z_{\rm phot}=6.7\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors ($F277W-F444W\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection for the widely-studied ``little red dot" (LRD) population with the exception of their spatially-resolved morphologies. The morphology of our targets allows us to conclude that their red continuum is dominated by highly obscured stellar emission and not by reddened nuclear activity. Using a variety of SED-fitting tools and star formation histories, we estimate the stellar masses to be $\log(M_\star)=11.32^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$ $M_\odot$ and $\log(M_\star)=11.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_\odot$, respectively, with a red continuum emission dominated by a recent episode of star formation. We then compare their number density to the halo mass function to infer stellar baryon fractions of $\epsilon_\star\sim0.25$ and $\epsilon_\star\sim0.5$. Both are significantly higher than what is commonly observed in lower-z galaxies or more dust-obscured galaxies at similar redshifts. With very bright ultra-high-z Lyman-Break Galaxies and some non-AGN dominated LRDs, such ``extended" LRDs represent another population that may require very efficient star formation at early times.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Between Dust and Gas Contents in Molecular Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular clouds are regions of dense gas and dust in space where new stars and planets are born. There is a strong correlation between the distribution of dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds. The present work focuses on the three-dimensional morphological comparisons between dust and gas within 567 molecular clouds identified in previously published catalog. We confirm a sample of 112 molecular clouds, where the cloud morphology based on CO observations and dust observations displays good overall consistency. There are up to 334 molecular clouds whose dust distribution might be related to the distribution of gas. We are unable to find gas structures that correlate with the shape of the dust distribution in 24 molecular clouds. For the 112 molecular clouds where the dust distribution correlates very well with the distribution of gas, we use CO observational data to measure the physical properties of these molecular clouds and compare them with the results derived from dust, exploring the correlation between gas and dust in the molecular clouds. We found that the gas and dust in the molecular clouds have a fairly good linear relationship, with a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) of $\mathrm{GDR}=(2.80_{-0.34}^{+0.37})\times10^{21}\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\, mag^{-1}}$. The ratio varies considerably among different molecular clouds. We measured the scale height of dust-CO clouds exhibiting strong correlations, finding $h_{Z} = 43.3_{-3.5}^{+4.0}\mathrm{\,pc}$.</description>

      <title>Identification of Gravitational-waves from Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>

Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors like TianQin or LISA could observe extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals (EMRIs) at millihertz frequencies. The accurate identification of these EMRI signals from the data plays a crucial role in enabling in-depth study of astronomy and physics. We aim at the identification stage of the data analysis, with the aim to extract key features of the signal from the data, such as the evolution of the orbital frequency, as well as to pinpoint the parameter range that can fit the data well for the subsequent parameter inference stage. In this manuscript, we demonstrated the identification of EMRI signals without any additional prior information on physical parameters. High-precision measurements of EMRI signals have been achieved, using a hierarchical search. It combines the search for physical parameters that guide the subsequent parameter inference, and a semi-coherent search with phenomenological waveforms that reaches precision levels down to $10^{-4}$ for the phenomenological waveform parameters $\omega_{0}$, $\dot{\omega}_{0}$, and $\ddot{\omega}_{0}$. As a result, we obtain measurement relative errors of less than 4% for the mass of the massive black hole, while keeping the relative errors of the other parameters within as small as 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Examining the effects of dark matter spikes on eccentric intermediate mass ratio inspirals using N-body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that dark matter (DM) spikes around intermediate-mass black holes could cause observable dephasing in gravitational wave (GW) signals from Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs). Previous research primarily used non-self-consistent analytic methods to estimate the impact of DM spikes on eccentric IMRIs. Our study provides the first self-consistent treatment of this phenomenon using $N$-body simulations, incorporating Post-Newtonian effects up to the 2.5 order for accurate and robust results. Contrary to prior works, which posited that the cumulative effect of two-body encounters (dynamical friction; DF) is the primary mechanism for energy dissipation, we reveal that a three-body effect (slingshot mechanism) plays a more significant role in driving the binary system's energy loss and consequent orbital shrinkage. We find that binaries counter-rotating with respect to the DM spike merge faster, while co-rotating binaries merge slower, contrary to expectations from the DF theory. Using Fokker-Planck methods, we also assess the presence and detectability of spikes in realistic environments. When interacting with surrounding materials, DM spikes can have shallower slopes and lower densities than previously considered, leading to smaller signals and lower detection prospects via dephasing. Our results suggest that `deshifting' rather than dephasing might be a more optimistic signature, as it is more robust even in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. I. A Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance to the Fornax Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. Earlier studies have provided compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in SN~2023ixf revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radii and explosion energy of 2e51 erg, along with 0.06 solar mass of 56-Ni, though these properties are not unique due to modeling degeneracies. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to at least 1e16cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year, both assuming a wind-velocity of 10 km/s. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI], red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, and flattening in the Ks-band, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Scaleable inference of galaxy properties and redshifts with a data-driven population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pre-trained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$\alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $\sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($\sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=7\times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6\%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r&lt;25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $\gtrsim3\times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>
