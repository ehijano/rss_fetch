      <title>Finding quantum partial assignments by search-to-decision reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computer science, many search problems are reducible to decision problems, which implies that finding a solution is as hard as deciding whether a solution exists. A quantum analogue of search-to-decision reductions would be to ask whether a quantum algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle can construct $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses as quantum states. By a result from Irani, Natarajan, Nirkhe, Rao, and Yuen (CCC '22), it is known that this does not hold relative to a quantum oracle, unlike the cases of $\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{MA}$, and $\mathsf{QCMA}$ where search-to-decision relativizes. We prove that if one is not interested in the quantum witness as a quantum state but only in terms of its partial assignments, i.e. the reduced density matrices, then there exists a classical polynomial-time algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle that outputs approximations of the density matrices of a near-optimal quantum witness, for any desired constant locality and inverse polynomial error. Our construction is based on a circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping that approximately preserves near-optimal $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses and a new $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem, Low-energy Density Matrix Verification, which is called by the $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle to adaptively construct approximately consistent density matrices of a low-energy state.</description>

      <title>QBF Merge Resolution is powerful but unnatural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.
  Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) M-Res is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that M-Res is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</description>

      <title>Capacity Planning in Stable Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the shortage of seats that the Chilean school choice system is facing, we introduce the problem of jointly increasing school capacities and finding a student-optimal assignment in the expanded market. Due to the theoretical and practical complexity of the problem, we provide a comprehensive set of tools to solve the problem, including different mathematical programming formulations, a cutting plane algorithm, and two heuristics that allow obtaining near-optimal solutions quickly. On the theoretical side, we show the correctness of our formulations, different properties of the objective and feasible region that facilitate computation, and also several properties of the underlying mechanism to find a student-optimal matching under capacity expansions. On the computational side, we use data from the Chilean school choice system to demonstrate the impact of our framework and derive insights that could help alleviate the problem. Our results show that each additional seat can benefit multiple students and that we can effectively target the assignment of previously unassigned students or improve the assignment of several students through improvement chains. Nevertheless, our results show that the marginal effect of each additional seat is decreasing and that simply adding seats is insufficient to ensure every student gets assigned to some school. Finally, we discuss several extensions of our framework, showcasing its flexibility to accommodate different needs.</description>
