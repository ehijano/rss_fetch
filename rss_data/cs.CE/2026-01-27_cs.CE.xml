      <title>Dynamic brittle fracture using Lip-field approach in an explicit dynamics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the dynamic response of a material body undergoing fracture subjected to high strain rate loading conditions such as impact or explosion. In particular, our focus is limited to softening elastic damage models using Lip-field regularization. The Lip-field approach is a new technique to introduce length scale into the softening damage models. It was first presented for the quasi-static case and then extended to a one-dimensional dynamic case. This paper extends the application of the Lip-field approach to dynamic fracture in two-dimensional cases. Lip-field approach is a variational approach, in which the potential to be minimized is a non-regularized one. A potential without regularization can result in spurious strain localization, but the Lip-field approach resolves this issue by imposing Lipschitz constraints on the damage field. Our focus is limited to utilizing an explicit staggered scheme to determine the displacement and damage fields. Numerical studies are conducted for two-dimensional cases to assess the dynamic behavior of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Informed Machine Learning in Electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation techniques such as the finite element method are essential for designing electrical devices, but their computational cost can be prohibitive for repeated or real-time computations. Projection-based model order reduction techniques mitigate this by reducing the model size and complexity, yet face challenges when extended to nonlinear or non-affine parametric models. In this work, Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is combined with proper orthogonal decomposition and Gaussian process regression to construct a non-intrusive surrogate model of a parametric nonlinear model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The differentiable nature of IGA allows for computationally efficient extraction of parametric sensitivities, which are leveraged for gradient-enhanced surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Calibration and Simulation of Thermo-Chemical Curing of Epoxy Resins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curing of epoxy resins poses a particular challenge in terms of modeling, experimental investigation, and numerical implementation, as it is a thermo-chemo-mechanical process. Several constitutive relations are required to model these processes, yielding numerous material parameters. The calibration of the constitutive relations must be performed using multiple steps, wherein uncertainties unavoidably propagate. In this study, we investigate the propagation of uncertainties during both the multi-step calibration procedure and the numerical simulation of curing processes with the identified parameters. For both, we employ the first-order second-moment method, which is carefully evaluated through coverage tests and by comparing it to the Monte Carlo method as a reference. It is demonstrated that the first-order second-moment method efficiently yields reasonable results, although providing only a first-order approximation of the highly nonlinear stochastic model response.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Hub Discovery in MDD Methylome: Hypotheses for Molecular Subtypes via Computational Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome with diverse etiological pathways. Traditional Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) have successfully identified risk loci based on differential methylation magnitude. As a complementary perspective, effect-size-based ranking alone may not fully capture regulatory nodes that exhibit modest methylation changes but occupy critical upstream positions in biological networks. Here, we report findings and hypotheses from a two-tier computational analysis of DNA methylation data (GSE198904; \(n=206\) ), combining conventional statistical approaches with machine learning-assisted regulatory inference.</description>

      <title>SpecBridge: Bridging Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Representations via Cross-Modal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17204v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) remains a bottleneck in untargeted settings where spectral libraries are incomplete. While deep learning offers a solution, current approaches typically fall into two extremes: explicit generative models that construct molecular graphs atom-by-atom, or joint contrastive models that learn cross-modal subspaces from scratch. We introduce SpecBridge, a novel implicit alignment framework that treats structure identification as a geometric alignment problem. SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings. Across MassSpecGym, Spectraverse, and MSnLib benchmarks, SpecBridge improves top-1 retrieval accuracy by roughly 20-25% relative to strong neural baselines, while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. These results suggest that aligning to frozen foundation models is a practical, stable alternative to designing new architectures from scratch. The code for SpecBridge is released at https://github.com/HassounLab/SpecBridge.</description>

      <title>FinMetaMind: A Tech Blueprint on NLQ Systems for Financial Knowledge Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Query (NLQ) allows users to search and interact with information systems using plain, human language instead of structured query syntax. This paper presents a technical blueprint on the design of a modern NLQ system tailored to financial knowledge search. The introduction of NLQ not only enhances the precision and recall of the knowledge search compared to traditional methods, but also facilitates deeper insights by efficiently linking disparate financial objects, events, and relationships. Using core constructs from natural language processing, search engineering, and vector data models, the proposed system aims to address key challenges in discovering, relevance ranking, data freshness, and entity recognition intrinsic to financial data retrieval. In this work, we detail the unique requirements of NLQ for financial datasets and documents, outline the architectural components for offline indexing and online retrieval, and discuss the real-world use cases of enhanced knowledge search in financial services. We delve into the theoretical underpinnings and experimental evidence supporting our proposed architecture, ultimately providing a comprehensive analysis on the subject matter. We also provide a detailed elaboration of our experimental methodology, the data used, the results and future optimizations in this study.</description>

      <title>Warp Quantification Analysis: A Framework For Path-based Signal Alignment Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely used to align time series evolving on mismatched timescales, yet most applications reduce alignment to a scalar distance. We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</description>

      <title>ManuRAG: Multi-modal Retrieval Augmented Generation for Manufacturing Question Answering (Early Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of digital manufacturing requires intelligent Question Answering (QA) systems that can seamlessly integrate and analyze complex multi-modal data, such as text, images, formulas, and tables. Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods often fall short in handling this complexity, resulting in subpar performance. We introduce ManuRAG, an innovative multi-modal RAG framework designed for manufacturing QA, incorporating specialized techniques to improve answer accuracy, reliability, and interpretability. To benchmark performance, we evaluate ManuRAG on three datasets comprising a total of 1,515 QA pairs, corresponding to mathematical, multiple-choice, and review-based questions in manufacturing principles and practices. Experimental results show that ManuRAG consistently outperforms existing methods across all evaluated datasets. Furthermore, ManuRAG's adaptable design makes it applicable to other domains, including law, healthcare, and finance, positioning it as a versatile tool for domain-specific QA.</description>

      <title>CoBRA: Programming Cognitive Bias in Social Agents Using Classic Social Science Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behavior through implicit natural-language descriptions often do not yield consistent behavior across models, and the resulting behavior does not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA introduces a model-agnostic way to control agent behavior that lets researchers explicitly specify desired nuances and obtain consistent behavior across models. At the heart of CoBRA is a novel closed-loop system primitive with two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the demonstrated cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classic social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to exhibit controlled cognitive bias. Through CoBRA, we show how to operationalize validated social science knowledge (i.e., classical experiments) as reusable "gym" environments for AI -- an approach that may generalize to richer social and affective simulations beyond bias alone.</description>

      <title>Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a consistent shared spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulates coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Through an information bottleneck objective, this framework prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations-an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further utilized by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to collective intelligence.</description>
