      <title>A High Throughput Virtual Screening Approach for Identifying Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence-Based Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers the promise of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), without the heavy metals requirement of the previous generation of OLEDs. However, the design of new TADF emitters is complicated by competing requirements, which require opposing design strategies. High throughput virtual screening (HTVS) approaches, however, offer the possibility of identifying new TADF emitters without necessarily relying on existing design rules. In this work the STONED algorithm [A. Nigam et al., Chem. Sci., 2021, 12, 7079] is used to impose random structural mutations starting from a set of twenty parent molecules, composed of both traditional donor-acceptor and multiresonant TADF emitters. Following this, successive filters are applied based on features of the atomic structure through to time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Although the randomised approach proves to be ill-suited to rediscovering existing TADF emitters, the resulting workflow leads to the identification of a number of molecules with promising properties for TADF, across a range of emission colours.</description>

      <title>Weighted Active Space Protocol for Multireference Machine-Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) offer an effective means of capturing electronic correlation in systems with significant multiconfigurational character. However, their application to train machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLPs) for catalytic dynamics has been challenging due to the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the underlying active space, which complicates achieving consistent energies and gradients across diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Weighted Active-Space Protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrate the method on the TiC+-catalyzed C-H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn-Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a new paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03332v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Strontium I, III, IV and V: Electron Impact Excitation Data for Kilonovae and White Dwarf Diagnostic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the role of LiBr as redox mediator in Li-O2 Aprotic Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-oxygen batteries are among the most promising energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density, but their practical implementation is hindered by poor reversibility and parasitic reactions. Redox mediators such as LiBr have emerged as a strategy to enhance reaction kinetics and reduce overpotentials. In this study, we explore the impact of three different solvents, dimethoxyethane (DME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on the electrochemical performance and reaction pathways of LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cells. Our results reveal that a 1O2 evolution channel that leads to singlet oxygen-induced cell degradation is active only in the TEGDME-based electrolyte. Both DME and DMSO allow singlet oxygen-free Oxygen Evolution Reaction, but only DME is found chemically stable in the LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cell working conditions. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent-mediator interactions in determining the performance of Li-O2 cells.</description>

      <title>Shift of nanodroplet and nanocluster size distributions induced by dopant pick-up statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pick-up experiments using nanodroplet and nanocluster beams, the size distribution of hosts carrying a specified number of dopants changes when the vapor density in the pick-up region is altered. This change, analyzed here, has quantitative consequences for the interpretation of data that are sensitive to host size, such as mass spectrometric, spectroscopic, and deflection measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic data on alkali-atom dimers residing on the surface of liquid helium nanodroplets have revealed that they are detected primarily in the weakly bound, metastable, spin-triplet state. Here, by measuring the magnetic Stern-Gerlach deflection of a sodium-doped nanodroplet beam, we transparently demonstrate the abundance of high-magnetic-moment dimers. Their electron spins thermalize with the cryogenic superfluid droplets and become fully oriented by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Catalysis With In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can perform accurate classification with zero or few examples through in-context learning. We extend this capability to regression with uncertainty estimation using frozen LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, Gemini), enabling Bayesian optimization (BO) in natural language without explicit model training or feature engineering. We apply this to materials discovery by representing experimental catalyst synthesis and testing procedures as natural language prompts. A key challenge in materials discovery is the need to characterize suboptimal candidates, which slows progress. While BO is effective for navigating large design spaces, standard surrogate models like Gaussian processes assume smoothness and continuity, an assumption that fails in highly non-linear domains such as heterogeneous catalysis. Our task-agnostic BO workflow overcomes this by operating directly in language space, producing interpretable and actionable predictions without requiring structural or electronic descriptors. On benchmarks like aqueous solubility and oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), BO-ICL matches or outperforms Gaussian processes. In live experiments on the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, BO-ICL identifies near-optimal multi-metallic catalysts within six iterations from a pool of 3,700 candidates. Our method redefines materials representation and accelerates discovery, with broad applications across catalysis, materials science, and AI.

      <title>Exploiting a Shortcoming of Coupled-Cluster Theory: The Extent of non-Hermiticity as a Diagnostic Indicator of Computational Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental non-Hermitian nature of the forms of coupled-cluster (CC) theory widely used in quantum chemistry has usually been viewed as a negative, but the present letter shows how this can be used to advantage. Specifically, the non-symmetric nature of the reduced one-particle density matrix (in the molecular orbital basis) is advocated as a diagnostic indicator of computational quality. In the limit of full coupled-cluster theory (which is equivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI)), the electronic wavefunction and correlation energy are exact within a given one-particle basis set and the symmetric character of the exact density matrix is recovered. The extent of the density matrix asymmetry is shown to provide a measure of ``how difficult the problem is'' (like the well-known T$_1$ diagnostic), but its variation with level of theory also gives information about ``how well this particular method works'', irrespective of the difficulty of the problem at hand. The proposed diagnostic is described and applied to a select group of small molecules, and an example of its overall utility for the practicing quantum chemist is illustrated through its application to the beryllium dimer (Be$_2$). Future applications of this idea to excited states, open-shell systems, symmetry-breaking problems and extension of the method to the two-particle density are then proposed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallelization of Message Passing Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular. However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Aligning Transformers with Continuous Feedback via Energy Rank Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.</description>

      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear optical probe for cavity-dressed vibrational mode mixing: multidimensional double-quantum coherence and photon-echo signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</description>
