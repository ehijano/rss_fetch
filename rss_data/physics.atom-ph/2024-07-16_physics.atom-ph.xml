      <title>Analytical Expression for Continuum-continuum Transition Amplitude of Hydrogen-like Atoms with Angular-momentum Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond chronoscopy typically utilises interfering two-photon transitions to access the phase information. Simulating these two-photon transitions is challenging due to the continuum-continuum transition term. The hydrogenic approximation within second-order perturbation theory has been widely used due to the existence of analytical expressions of the wave functions. So far, only (partially) asymptotic results have been derived, which fail to correctly describe the low-kinetic-energy behaviour, especially for high angular-momentum states. Here, we report an analytical expression that overcome these limitations. They are based on the Appell's F1 function and use the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind as the intermediate states. We show that the derived formula can be applied to arbitrarily high angular momenta and quantitatively agrees with the numerical simulations using the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we give an angular-momentum-dependent asymptotic form of the outgoing wavefunction and their continuum-continuum dipole transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Cooling of gold cluster anions, Au$_N^-$, $N=2-13,15$, in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the spontaneous and photo-induced decays of anionic gold clusters, Au$_N^-$, with sizes ranging from $N = 2$ to 13, and 15. After production in a sputter ion source, the size-selected clusters were stored in the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE and their neutralization decays were measured for storage times between 0.1 and 100 s. The dimer was observed to decay by electron emission in parallel to neutral atom emission at long times, analogously to the behavior of copper and silver dimers, implying a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Radiative cooling is observed for all cluster sizes except for the dimer. The decay rates of clusters $N=3,6,8-13,15$ show only a single radiative cooling time. For $N=6-13$ the cooling times have a strong odd-even oscillation with an amplitude that decrease with cluster size, and with the even $N$ having the fast cooling. We compare our results with previous measurements of radiative cooling rates of the corresponding cationic gold clusters, Au$_N^+$, which also show an odd-even effect with a similar oscillation amplitude but at orders of magnitude shorter time scales, and out of phase with the anions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Emission of Strontium in a Cryogenic Buffer Gas Beam Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate production of cold atomic strontium (Sr) and strontium-containing molecules (SrOH) in a cryogenic buffer gas beam source via direct heating of strontium oxide (SrO) with 30 mJ laser pulses several milliseconds long. $3.7(2)\times10^{14}$ Sr atoms are released, which represents a factor of 7 increase in atomic production per pulse compared to nanosecond-scale ablation laser pulses. A peak atomic density of $1.93(6) \times 10^{12}$ atoms/cm$^3$ is achieved, which corresponds to a factor of 2 increase relative to ablation. We further propose methods of extending this method to other atomic and molecular species.</description>

      <title>Dressing trapped ions with integrated wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss dressing trapped ions with the near field of a trap integrated wire. Ramping a dressing field on/off adiabatically before/after an operation changes its effective Hamiltonian. The amplitude and detuning of the dressing field act as tunable degrees of freedom we can use to `customize' the properties of any operation. We propose three use cases for this general tool. First, we can generate `artificial' clock states, where we eliminate the (assumed to be small) linear sensitivity of a qubit. Second, we can break the degeneracies that often complicate shelving at low quantization fields\textemdash allowing us to implement operations with linearly polarized microwaves that would, otherwise, require circular polarization. Finally, we can implement laser-free single qubit gates on a set of `target' ions using fields that are separated from the rest of the computer in frequency space.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction and its various reduced ones as well as the relativistic corrections. Examples are such as the electron-phonon interaction, the Heisenberg exchange spin interaction, the superexchange interaction, the van der Waals interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, the Breit interaction, {\it etc}. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical or chemical properties of the matters or the biological activity of the living organisms on Earth at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Coulomb interaction relevant Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>

      <title>Controllable interatomic interaction mediated by diffractive coupling in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-mediated interaction can be used for simulating complex many-body phenomena with ultracold atoms coupled to electromagnetic modes of an optical resonator. We theoretically study a method of producing controllable interatomic interaction mediated by forward-diffracted photons circulating inside a ring cavity. One example of such a system is the three-mode cavity, where an on-axis mode can coexist with two diffracted sidebands. We demonstrate how the self-organized stripe states of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) occurring in this cavity geometry can exhibit supersolid properties, due to spontaneous breaking of the Hamiltonian's continuous translational symmetry. A numerical study of the collective excitation spectrum of these states demonstrates the existence of massles and finite-gap excitations, which are identified as phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) atomic density modes. We further demonstrate how judicious Fourier filtering of intracavity light can be used to engineer the effective atom-atom interaction profile for many cavity modes. The numerical results in this configuration show the existence of droplet array and single droplet BEC states for commensurate and incommensurate cavity modes, respectively. Diffractive coupling in a cavity is thereby introduced as a novel route towards tailoring the photon-mediated interaction of ultracold atoms. Spatial features of the self-organized optical potentials can here be tuned to scales several times larger than the pump laser wavelength, such that the corresponding atomic density distributions could be imaged and manipulated using low numerical aperture optics. These calculations and insights pave the way towards quantum simulation of exotic nonequilibrium many-body physics with condensates in a cavity.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval in positronium using field-ionization of Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new 40 ppb measurement of the positronium $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval using pulsed two-photon optical spectroscopy. The transition is detected via field-ionization of atoms excited from the 2S to the 20P Rydberg state. Precise Monte-Carlo line-shape simulations allow for the accounting of effects such as Doppler and AC Stark shifts, while an optical heterodyne measurement of the excitation laser pulse is used to correct for laser frequency chirp. A value of $1\,233\,607\,210.5\pm 49.6\, \mathrm{MHz}$ was obtained. This scheme allows for the measurement of the velocity distribution of positronium atoms to correct for the second-order Doppler effect. This is the major source of systematic uncertainty expected for future measurements of this transition with a CW laser, thus, our technique paves the way toward a new generation of a high precision determination of this interval in positronium.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Silicon Photonic Single-Sideband Modulators for Cold Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most complicated and challenging system within a light-pulse atom interferometer (LPAI) is the laser system, which controls the frequencies and intensities of multiple laser beams over time to configure quantum gravity and inertial sensors. The main function of an LPAI laser system is to perform cold-atom generation, state-preparation, state-selective detection and to generate coherent two-photon process for the light-pulse sequence. Substantial miniaturization and ruggedization of the laser system can be achieved by bringing most key functions of the laser system onto photonic integrated circuit (PIC). We demonstrate a high-performance silicon photonic suppressed-carrier single-sideband (SC-SSB) modulator at 1560 nm, which can dynamically frequency shift within the LPAI. With independent RF-channel control, we study the imbalances in both the optical and RF phases/amplitudes to reach 30 dB carrier-suppression, unprecedented 47.8 dB sideband-suppression at peak conversion-efficiency: -6.846 dB (20.7 %). Using a silicon photonic SSB-modulator, we demonstrate cold-atom generation, state-selective detection, and atom interferometer fringes to estimate gravitational acceleration, $g \approx 9.77 \pm 0.01 \,\rm{m/s^2}$, in a Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atom system.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing from Finite Temperature Easy-plane Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezing is a form of entanglement that reshapes the quantum projection noise to improve measurement precision. Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite temperature, easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin-squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies in between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states.</description>

      <title>Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward: Laser Phase Noise Suppression beyond Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser frequency stabilization is a powerful technique widely used for building narrow-linewidth lasers. This technique is however ineffective in suppressing high-frequency (&gt;100~kHz) laser phase noise detrimental for many applications. Here, we introduce an effective method which can greatly enhance its high-frequency performance. The idea is to recycle the residual PDH signal of a laser locked to a cavity, by feedforwarding it directly to the laser output field after a delay fiber. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrate a phase noise suppression capability about 4 orders of magnitude better than just using usual PDH feedback for phase noise around a few MHz. We further find that this method exhibits noise suppression performance equivalent to cavity filtering. The new method holds great promise for applications demanding highly stable lasers with diminished phase noise up to tens of MHz, e.g. precise and high-speed control of atomic and molecular quantum states.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Atom-Molecule Superfluids Near a Narrow Feshbach Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of a stable molecular condensate emerging from a condensate of bosonic atoms and related "super-chemical" dynamics have raised an intriguing set of questions. Here we provide a microscopic understanding of this unexpected stability and dynamics in atom-molecule superfluids; we show one essential element behind these phenomena is an extremely narrow Feshbach resonance in $^{133}$Cs at 19.849G. Comparing theory and experiment we demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\textit{i.e.}, Bose enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the formation of Cooper-like pairs of bosonic atoms that have opposite momenta. Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>
