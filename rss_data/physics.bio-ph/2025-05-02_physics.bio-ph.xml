      <title>Large Language Models as AI Agents for Digital Atoms and Molecules: Catalyzing a New Era in Computational Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational biophysics, where molecular data is expanding rapidly and system complexity is increasing exponentially, large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems are fundamentally reshaping the field. This perspective article examines the recent advances at the intersection of LLMs, intelligent agents, and scientific computation, with a focus on biophysical computation. Building on these advancements, we introduce ADAM (Agent for Digital Atoms and Molecules), an innovative multi-agent LLM-based framework. ADAM employs cutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular design. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines LLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover, its ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool orchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the significant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in establishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents, and building an open collaborative ecosystem. ADAM is accessible at https://sidereus-ai.com.</description>

      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of mRNA Molecules in a General Transcription Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gene expression is a fundamental yet complicated problem in biophysics, aiming to quantitatively describe the central dogma. Lack of thorough analysis and computationally efficient approach for fine-grained transcription models has confined relevant research to canonical Telegraph model. We study a general model of transcription and exactly solve the time-dependent chemical master equation. An approach highlighting computational efficiency is presented and analyzed for stationary distribution of mRNA molecules. Distribution of mRNA copy number is found to be upper-bounded by a constant multiple of Poisson distribution. Our result features generality, profundity and outstanding computational performance, unifying existing theoretical results on transcription kinetics and exhibiting broader applicability in practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Structure of Bifurcations during Spatial Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals must constantly make decisions on the move, such as when choosing among multiple options, or "targets", in space. Recent evidence suggests that this results from a recursive feedback between the (vectorial) neural representation of the targets and the resulting motion defined by this consensus, which then changes the egocentric neural representation of the the options, and so on. Here we employ a simple model of this process to both explore how its dynamics account for the experimentally-observed abruptly-branching trajectories exhibited by animals during spatial decision-making, and to provide new insights into spatiotemporal computation. Essential neural dynamics, notably local excitation and long-range inhibition, are captured in our model via spin-system dynamics, with groups of Ising-spins representing neural "activity bumps" corresponding to target directions. Analysis, employing a novel "mean-field trajectory" approach, reveals the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking - bifurcations in the model that result in literal bifurcations in trajectory space and how it results in new geometric principles for spatiotemporal decision-making. We find that all bifurcation points, beyond the very first, fall on a small number of "bifurcation curves". It is the spatial organization of these curves that is shown to be key to determining the shape of the trajectories, such as self-similar or space filling, exhibited during decision-making, irrespective of the trajectory's starting point. Furthermore, we find that a non-Euclidean representation of space considerably reduces the number of bifurcation points in many geometrical configurations, preventing endless indecision and promoting effective spatial decision-making. This suggests that a non-Euclidean neural representation of space may be expected to have evolved across species in order to facilitate spatial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Integrating Dynamical Systems Modeling with Spatiotemporal scRNA-seq Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of biological systems is fundamental to deciphering cellular behavior, developmental processes, and disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>
