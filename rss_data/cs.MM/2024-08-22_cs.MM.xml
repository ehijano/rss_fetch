      <title>Exploring the Role of Audio in Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of deepfake technology, especially the deep audio fake technology, misinformation detection on the social media scene meets a great challenge. Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</description>

      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor controllability and alignment, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as a temporal event condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope feature closely related to audio semantics, ensures high controllability and synchronization. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Code, model weights, and demonstrations are available on the accompanying website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>AIM 2024 Challenge on Compressed Video Quality Assessment: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a crucial task in the development of video compression standards, as it directly impacts the viewer experience. This paper presents the results of the Compressed Video Quality Assessment challenge, held in conjunction with the Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop at ECCV 2024. The challenge aimed to evaluate the performance of VQA methods on a diverse dataset of 459 videos, encoded with 14 codecs of various compression standards (AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, AV1, and VVC/H.266) and containing a comprehensive collection of compression artifacts. To measure the methods performance, we employed traditional correlation coefficients between their predictions and subjective scores, which were collected via large-scale crowdsourced pairwise human comparisons. For training purposes, participants were provided with the Compressed Video Quality Assessment Dataset (CVQAD), a previously developed dataset of 1022 videos. Up to 30 participating teams registered for the challenge, while we report the results of 6 teams, which submitted valid final solutions and code for reproducing the results. Moreover, we calculated and present the performance of state-of-the-art VQA methods on the developed dataset, providing a comprehensive benchmark for future research. The dataset, results, and online leaderboard are publicly available at https://challenges.videoprocessing.ai/challenges/compressed-video-quality-assessment.html.</description>

      <title>Let Community Rules Be Reflected in Online Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content moderation is a widely used strategy to prevent the dissemination of irregular information on social media platforms. Despite extensive research on developing automated models to support decision-making in content moderation, there remains a notable scarcity of studies that integrate the rules of online communities into content moderation. This study addresses this gap by proposing a community rule-based content moderation framework that directly integrates community rules into the moderation of user-generated content. Our experiment results with datasets collected from two domains demonstrate the superior performance of models based on the framework to baseline models across all evaluation metrics. In particular, incorporating community rules substantially enhances model performance in content moderation. The findings of this research have significant research and practical implications for improving the effectiveness and generalizability of content moderation models in online communities.</description>

      <title>MaVEn: An Effective Multi-granularity Hybrid Visual Encoding Framework for Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MaVEn, an innovative Multi-granularity Visual Encoding framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in multi-image reasoning. Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts.</description>

      <title>DreamCinema: Cinematic Transfer with Free Camera and 3D Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are living in a flourishing era of digital media, where everyone has the potential to become a personal filmmaker. Current research on cinematic transfer empowers filmmakers to reproduce and manipulate the visual elements (e.g., cinematography and character behaviors) from classic shots. However, characters in the reimagined films still rely on manual crafting, which involves significant technical complexity and high costs, making it unattainable for ordinary users. Furthermore, their estimated cinematography lacks smoothness due to inadequate capturing of inter-frame motion and modeling of physical trajectories. Fortunately, the remarkable success of 2D and 3D AIGC has opened up the possibility of efficiently generating characters tailored to users' needs, diversifying cinematography. In this paper, we propose DreamCinema, a novel cinematic transfer framework that pioneers generative AI into the film production paradigm, aiming at facilitating user-friendly film creation. Specifically, we first extract cinematic elements (i.e., human and camera pose) and optimize the camera trajectory. Then, we apply a character generator to efficiently create 3D high-quality characters with a human structure prior. Finally, we develop a structure-guided motion transfer strategy to incorporate generated characters into film creation and transfer it via 3D graphics engines smoothly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for creating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</description>

      <title>SZTU-CMU at MER2024: Improving Emotion-LLaMA with Conv-Attention for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents our winning approach for the MER-NOISE and MER-OV tracks of the MER2024 Challenge on multimodal emotion recognition. Our system leverages the advanced emotional understanding capabilities of Emotion-LLaMA to generate high-quality annotations for unlabeled samples, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. To enhance multimodal fusion while mitigating modality-specific noise, we introduce Conv-Attention, a lightweight and efficient hybrid framework. Extensive experimentation vali-dates the effectiveness of our approach. In the MER-NOISE track, our system achieves a state-of-the-art weighted average F-score of 85.30%, surpassing the second and third-place teams by 1.47% and 1.65%, respectively. For the MER-OV track, our utilization of Emotion-LLaMA for open-vocabulary annotation yields an 8.52% improvement in average accuracy and recall compared to GPT-4V, securing the highest score among all participating large multimodal models. The code and model for Emotion-LLaMA are available at https://github.com/ZebangCheng/Emotion-LLaMA.</description>

      <title>Generalized Face Forgery Detection via Adaptive Learning for Pre-trained Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of generative models, the current challenge in face forgery detection is how to effectively detect realistic manipulated faces from different unseen domains. Though previous studies show that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) based models can achieve some promising results after fully fine-tuning on the Deepfake dataset, their generalization performances are still unsatisfactory. One possible reason is that fully fine-tuned ViT-based models may disrupt the pre-trained features [1, 2] and overfit to some data-specific patterns [3]. To alleviate this issue, we present a \textbf{F}orgery-aware \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Vi}sion \textbf{T}ransformer (FA-ViT) under the adaptive learning paradigm, where the parameters in the pre-trained ViT are kept fixed while the designed adaptive modules are optimized to capture forgery features. Specifically, a global adaptive module is designed to model long-range interactions among input tokens, which takes advantage of self-attention mechanism to mine global forgery clues. To further explore essential local forgery clues, a local adaptive module is proposed to expose local inconsistencies by enhancing the local contextual association. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained adaptive learning module that emphasizes the common compact representation of genuine faces through relationship learning in fine-grained pairs, driving these proposed adaptive modules to be aware of fine-grained forgery-aware information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FA-ViT achieves state-of-the-arts results in the cross-dataset evaluation, and enhances the robustness against unseen perturbations. Particularly, FA-ViT achieves 93.83\% and 78.32\% AUC scores on Celeb-DF and DFDC datasets in the cross-dataset evaluation.

      <title>Lighthouse: A User-Friendly Library for Reproducible Video Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Lighthouse, a user-friendly library for reproducible video moment retrieval and highlight detection (MR-HD). Although researchers proposed various MR-HD approaches, the research community holds two main issues. The first is a lack of comprehensive and reproducible experiments across various methods, datasets, and video-text features. This is because no unified training and evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly design. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up individual environments. In addition, most works release only the training codes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD. Lighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible codebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In addition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods easily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate that Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference papers. The code is available at https://github.com/line/lighthouse.</description>

      <title>Concept Conductor: Orchestrating Multiple Personalized Concepts in Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The customization of text-to-image models has seen significant advancements, yet generating multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. Current methods struggle with attribute leakage and layout confusion when handling multiple concepts, leading to reduced concept fidelity and semantic consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free framework, Concept Conductor, designed to ensure visual fidelity and correct layout in multi-concept customization. Concept Conductor isolates the sampling processes of multiple custom models to prevent attribute leakage between different concepts and corrects erroneous layouts through self-attention-based spatial guidance. Additionally, we present a concept injection technique that employs shape-aware masks to specify the generation area for each concept. This technique injects the structure and appearance of personalized concepts through feature fusion in the attention layers, ensuring harmony in the final image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Concept Conductor can consistently generate composite images with accurate layouts while preserving the visual details of each concept. Compared to existing baselines, Concept Conductor shows significant performance improvements. Our method supports the combination of any number of concepts and maintains high fidelity even when dealing with visually similar concepts. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Nihukat/Concept-Conductor.</description>
