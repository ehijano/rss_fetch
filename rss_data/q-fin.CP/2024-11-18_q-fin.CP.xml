      <title>Deep Hedging Bermudan Swaptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a novel approach to Bermudan swaption hedging by applying the deep hedging framework to address limitations of traditional arbitrage-free methods. Conventional methods assume ideal conditions, such as zero transaction costs, perfect liquidity, and continuous-time hedging, which often differ from real market environments. This discrepancy can lead to residual profit and loss (P&amp;L), resulting in two primary issues. First, residual P&amp;L may prevent achieving the initial model price, especially with improper parameter settings, potentially causing a negative P&amp;L trend and significant financial impacts. Second, controlling the distribution of residual P&amp;L to mitigate downside risk is challenging, as hedged positions may become curve gamma-short, making them vulnerable to large interest rate movements. The deep hedging approach enables flexible selection of convex risk measures and hedge strategies, allowing for improved residual P&amp;L management. This study also addresses challenges in applying the deep hedging approach to Bermudan swaptions, such as efficient arbitrage-free market scenario generation and managing early exercise conditions. Additionally, we introduce a unique "Option Spread Hedge" strategy, which allows for robust hedging and provides intuitive interpretability. Numerical analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Optimization with Feedback Strategies Based on Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN) are starting to play an increasingly important role in quantitative finance. Dynamic portfolio optimization is among many problems that have significantly benefited from a wider adoption of deep learning (DL). While most existing research has primarily focused on how DL can alleviate the curse of dimensionality when solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, some very recent developments propose to forego derivation and solution of HJB in favor of empirical utility maximization over dynamic allocation strategies expressed through ANN. In addition to being simple and transparent, this approach is universally applicable, as it is essentially agnostic about market dynamics. To showcase the method, we apply it to optimal portfolio allocation between a cash account and the S&amp;P 500 index modeled using geometric Brownian motion or the Heston model. In both cases, the results are demonstrated to be on par with those under the theoretical optimal weights assuming isoelastic utility and real-time rebalancing. A set of R codes for a broad class of stochastic volatility models are provided as a supplement.</description>

      <title>Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand price trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We extract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language model (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of consumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services by utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of respondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified price-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a general purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives on consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to achieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM for classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs suggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The use of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an index with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We demonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a larger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation based on the industry of the survey respondents.</description>

      <title>Realised Volatility Forecasting: Machine Learning via Financial Word Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops a financial word embedding using 15 years of business news. Our results show that this specialised language model produces more accurate results than general word embeddings, based on a financial benchmark we established. As an application, we incorporate this word embedding into a simple machine learning model to enhance the HAR model for forecasting realised volatility. This approach statistically and economically outperforms established econometric models. Using an explainable AI method, we also identify key phrases in business news that contribute significantly to volatility, offering insights into language patterns tied to market dynamics.</description>
