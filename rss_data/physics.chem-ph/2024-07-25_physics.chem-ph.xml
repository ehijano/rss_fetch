      <title>Application of the Digital Annealer Unit in Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions for Enhanced Production Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding appropriate reaction conditions that yield high product rates in chemical synthesis is crucial for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However, due to the vast chemical space, conducting experiments for each possible reaction condition is impractical. Consequently, models such as QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) or ML (Machine Learning) have been developed to predict the outcomes of reactions and illustrate how reaction conditions affect product yield. Despite these advancements, inferring all possible combinations remains computationally prohibitive when using a conventional CPU. In this work, we explore using a Digital Annealing Unit (DAU) to tackle these large-scale optimization problems more efficiently by solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Two types of QUBO models are constructed in this work: one using quantum annealing and the other using ML. Both models are built and tested on four high-throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets and selected Reaxys datasets. Our results suggest that the performance of models is comparable to classical ML methods (i.e., Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)), while the inference time of our models requires only seconds with a DAU. Additionally, in campaigns involving active learning and autonomous design of reaction conditions to achieve higher reaction yield, our model demonstrates significant improvements by adding new data, showing promise of adopting our method in the iterative nature of such problem settings. Our method can also accelerate the screening of billions of reaction conditions, achieving speeds millions of times faster than traditional computing units in identifying superior conditions. Therefore, leveraging the DAU with our developed QUBO models has the potential to be a valuable tool for innovative chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Molecular Structure: A Multimodal Spectroscopic Dataset for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential tools for determining the structure of molecules. Different spectroscopic techniques, such as Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Infrared spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry, provide insight into the molecular structure, including the presence or absence of functional groups. Chemists leverage the complementary nature of the different methods to their advantage. However, the lack of a comprehensive multimodal dataset, containing spectra from a variety of spectroscopic techniques, has limited machine-learning approaches mostly to single-modality tasks for predicting molecular structures from spectra. Here we introduce a dataset comprising simulated $^1$H-NMR, $^{13}$C-NMR, HSQC-NMR, Infrared, and Mass spectra (positive and negative ion modes) for 790k molecules extracted from chemical reactions in patent data. This dataset enables the development of foundation models for integrating information from multiple spectroscopic modalities, emulating the approach employed by human experts. Additionally, we provide benchmarks for evaluating single-modality tasks such as structure elucidation, predicting the spectra for a target molecule, and functional group predictions. This dataset has the potential automate structure elucidation, streamlining the molecular discovery pipeline from synthesis to structure determination. The dataset and code for the benchmarks can be found at https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/multimodal-spectroscopic-dataset.</description>

      <title>Ab initio treatment of molecular Coster-Kronig decay using complex-scaled equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancies in the L1 shell of atoms and molecules can decay non-radiatively via Coster-Kronig decay whereby the vacancy is filled by an electron from the L2,3 shell while a second electron is emitted into the ionization continuum. This process is akin to Auger decay, but in contrast to Auger electrons, Coster-Kronig electrons have rather low kinetic energies of less than 50 eV. In the present work, we extend recently introduced methods for the construction of molecular Auger spectra that are based on complex-scaled equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory to Coster-Kronig decay. We compute ionization energies as well as total and partial decay widths for the 2s-1 states of argon and hydrogen sulfide and construct the L1L2,3M Coster-Kronig and L1MM Auger spectra of these species. Whereas our final spectra are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data, substantial disagreements are found for various branching ratios suggesting that spin-orbit coupling makes a major impact on Coster-Kronig decay already in the third period of the periodic table.</description>

      <title>Simulating Passage through a Cascade of Conical Intersections with Collapse-to-a-Block Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ehrenfest with collapse-to-a-block (TAB) molecular dynamics approach was recently introduced to allow accurate simulation of nonadiabatic dynamics on many electronic states. Previous benchmarking work has demonstrated it to be highly accurate for modeling dynamics in one-dimensional analytical models, but nonadiabatic dynamics often involves conical intersections, which are inherently two-dimensional. In this report, we assess the performance of TAB on two-dimensional models of cascades of conical intersections in dense manifolds of states. Several variants of TAB are considered, including TAB-w, which is based on the assumption of a Gaussian rather than exponential decay of the coherence, and TAB-DMS, which incorporates an efficient collapse procedure based on approximate eigenstates. Upon comparison to numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations, it is found that all TAB variants provide a suitable description of the dynamical passage through a cascade of conical intersections. The TAB-w approach is found to provide a somewhat more accurate description of population dynamics than the original TAB method, with final absolute population errors $\leq$0.013 in all cases. Even when only four approximate eigenstates are computed, the use of approximate eigenstates was found to introduce minimal additional error (absolute population error $\leq$0.018 in all models).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Potential for Electrochemical Interfaces with Hybrid Representation of Dielectric Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding electrochemical interfaces at a microscopic level is essential for elucidating important electrochemical processes in electrocatalysis, batteries and corrosion. While \textit{ab initio} simulations have provided valuable insights into model systems, the high computational cost limits their use in tackling complex systems of relevance to practical applications. Machine learning potentials offer a solution, but their application in electrochemistry remains challenging due to the difficulty in treating the dielectric response of electronic conductors and insulators simultaneously. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework of machine learning potentials that is capable of simulating metal/electrolyte interfaces by unifying the interfacial dielectric response accounting for local electronic polarisation in electrolytes and non-local charge transfer in metal electrodes. We validate our method by reproducing the bell-shaped differential Helmholtz capacitance at the Pt(111)/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we apply the machine learning potential to calculate the dielectric profile at the interface, providing new insights into electronic polarisation effects. Our work lays the foundation for atomistic modelling of complex, realistic electrochemical interfaces using machine learning potential at \textit{ab initio} accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lead Free Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most viable renewable energies is solar power because of its versatility, reliability, and abundance.In the market, a majority of the solar panels are made from silicon wafers.These solar panels have an efficiency of 26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years.The perovskite solar cell is a relatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency and much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the most efficient type uses lead.The name perovskite refers to the crystal structure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell.All materials possess a property called a band gap.The smaller the band gap the more conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the smaller the band gap the better the solar cell.The Shockley-Queisser limit provides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction solar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells.This research focuses on tuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement. Through this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites were re-established.However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with existing DFT calculations.Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in this experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction.</description>

      <title>Simulating open-system molecular dynamics on analog quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions of molecules with their environment influence the course and outcome of almost all chemical reactions. However, classical computers struggle to accurately simulate complicated molecule-environment interactions because of the steep growth of computational resources with both molecule size and environment complexity. Therefore, many quantum-chemical simulations are restricted to isolated molecules, whose dynamics can dramatically differ from what happens in an environment. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can simulate open molecular systems by using the native dissipation of the simulator and injecting additional controllable dissipation. By exploiting the native dissipation to simulate the molecular dissipation -- rather than seeing it as a limitation -- our approach enables longer simulations of open systems than are possible for closed systems. In particular, we show that trapped-ion simulators using a mixed qudit-boson (MQB) encoding could simulate molecules in a wide range of condensed phases by implementing widely used dissipative processes within the Lindblad formalism, including pure dephasing and both electronic and vibrational relaxation. The MQB open-system simulations require significantly fewer additional quantum resources compared to both classical and digital quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>Basis set extrapolation from the vanishing counterpoise correction condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basis set extrapolations are typically rationalized either from analytical arguments involving the partial-wave or principal expansions of the correlation energy in helium-like systems, or from fitting extrapolation parameters to reference energetics for a small(ish) training set. Seeking to avoid both, we explore a third alternative: extracting extrapolation parameters from the requirement that the BSSE (basis set superposition error) should vanish at the complete basis set limit. We find this to be a viable approach provided that the underlying basis sets are not too small and reasonably well balanced. For basis sets not augmented by diffuse functions, BSSE minimization and energy fitting yield quite similar parameters.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within approximate or locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>

      <title>Unified Implementation of Relativistic Wave Function Methods: 4C-iCIPT2 as a Showcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In parallel to the unified construction of relativistic Hamiltonians based solely on physical arguments [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 084111 (2024)], a unified implementation of relativistic wave function methods is achieved here via programming techniques (e.g., template metaprogramming and polymorphism in C++). That is, once the code for constructing the Hamiltonian matrix is made ready, all the rest can be generated automatically from existing templates used for the nonrelativistic counterparts. This is facilitated by breaking a second-quantized relativistic Hamiltonian down to diagrams that are topologically the same as those required for computing the basic coupling coefficients between spin-free configuration state functions (CSF). Moreover, both time reversal and binary double point group symmetries can readily be incorporated into molecular integrals and Hamiltonian matrix elements. The latter can first be evaluated in the space of (randomly selected) spin-dependent determinants and then transformed to that of spin-dependent CSFs, thanks to simple relations in between. As a showcase, we consider here the no-pair four-component relativistic iterative configuration interaction with selection and perturbation correction (4C-iCIPT2), which is a natural extension of the spin-free iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17, 949 (2021)], and can provide near-exact numerical results within the manifold of positive energy states (PES), as demonstrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exist an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a principled approach to molecular design tasks. In this paper we explain three pitfalls of BO which can cause poor empirical performance: an incorrect prior width, over-smoothing, and inadequate acquisition function maximization. We show that with these issues addressed, even a basic BO setup is able to achieve the highest overall performance on the PMO benchmark for molecule design (Gao et al 2022). These results suggest that BO may benefit from more attention in the machine learning for molecules community.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited states of carbon dioxide molecule using time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutral ground state carbon dioxide is excited to $nd\sigma_g$ Henning sharp Rydberg states with an attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse train. A time delayed near infrared probe pulse is used to photoionize these states to their corresponding ionization limit $B^2\Sigma_u^+$. We obtain differential kinetic energy spectrograms and angular distributions for photoionization and autoionization channels. We model the competition between predissociation and autoionization in the Rydberg state dynamics and analyze differential photoelectron yield as a function of the time delay to extract previously unknown autoionization and predissociation lifetimes for three Henning sharp states (n = 4, 5, 6).</description>
