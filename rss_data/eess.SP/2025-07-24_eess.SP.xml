      <title>Time and Frequency Synchronization for Multiuser OTFS in Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for uplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work focuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for locating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances channel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an existing multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot (IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix (PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via correlation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a correlation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot structure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is proposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the delay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO estimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users' signals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical threshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major peak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest peak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the proposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into multiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO estimates for all the users.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Fluid Antennas: from Electromagnetics to Communications Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a popular topic in the wireless community as an effective yet simple means of exploiting spatial diversity. Due to the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically reconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs, since changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically moving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a challenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave simulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits the extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by these difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a complete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs. Specifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to rewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices accounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model is validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further illustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and provide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal covariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve similar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible antennas.</description>

      <title>Multiple Active STAR-RIS-Assisted Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication via Cooperative Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network empowered by multiple active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). A base station (BS) furnishes downlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a sensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the reflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to maximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an upper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual hardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The resulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating optimization (AO) framework. First, the original formulation is reformulated into an equivalent yet more tractable representation and partitioned into subproblems. The BS beamformer is updated in closed form via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, whereas the STAR-RIS reflection and transmission vectors are refined through successive convex approximation (SCA), yielding a semidefinite program that is then solved via semidefinite relaxation. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers substantial sum-rate gains over passive-RIS and single STAR-RIS baselines, all the while rigorously meeting the prescribed sensing and security constraints.</description>

      <title>Geometrical portrait of Multipath error propagation in GNSS Direct Position Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a method that directly estimate position, velocity, and time (PVT) information from cross ambiguity function (CAF) of the GNSS signals, significantly enhancing receiver robustness in urban environments. However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on multipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight the unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal noise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the theoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this paper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying the deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative to the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB) model is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite channels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established through discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness of the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo simulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT bias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite channels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles, influenced by the CAF multipath bias projection. This serves as a reference for selecting DPE satellites from a geometric standpoint, underscoring the importance of choosing a balanced combination of high and low elevation angles to achieve an optimal satellite geometry configuration.</description>

      <title>Envelope Control Enabled Probabilistic Shaping for Peak Power Constrained IM DD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic shaping (PS) has attracted significant attention in intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) systems. However, due to the unique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the PS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in systems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored for peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies in strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced impairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio enhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping (DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol mapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits pattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory length. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR algorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by DSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the proposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km single-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been demonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work opens a new sight for the application of the PS technique in PPC IM-DD systems with memory effects.</description>

      <title>GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system under spoofing and jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training, ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.</description>

      <title>Quantized Signal Recovery with Interference via Parametrized Look-Up Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient all-digital post-correction of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters can be achieved by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The performance of a LUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input signal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical estimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications to low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several approximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for Phase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference signals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the instantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree of accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases into the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power out-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant gain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to changes in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant interference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a fixed 12-tap model order we achieve $&gt;$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error and $&gt;$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.</description>

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for material characterization. However, careful preprocessing is required for the identification and handling of noise, baseline drift, and random spikes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to generating and preprocessing Raman spectra. Additionally, we describe methods for fitting Voigt peaks to the spectrum to determine peak parameters. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using both synthetic and real Raman spectra, with code provided in an open-source GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.</description>

      <title>Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem, noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth requirements.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications in MEC-Based Networked ISAC Systems Towards Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing (MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE systems.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-frame Detection via Graph Neural Networks: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-frame detection algorithms can effectively utilize the correlation between consecutive echoes to improve the detection performance of weak targets. Existing efficient multi-frame detection algorithms are typically based on three sequential steps: plot extraction via a relative low primary threshold, track search and track detection. However, these three-stage processing algorithms may result in a notable loss of detection performance and do not fully leverage the available echo information across frames. As to applying graph neural networks in multi-frame detection, the algorithms are primarily based on node classification tasks, which cannot directly output target tracks. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-frame detection problem as a link prediction task in graphs. First, we perform a rough association of multi-frame observations that exceed the low threshold to construct observation association graphs. Subsequently, a multi-feature link prediction network is designed based on graph neural networks, which integrates multi-dimensional information, including echo structure, Doppler information, and spatio-temporal coupling of plots. By leveraging the principle of link prediction, we unifies the processes of track search and track detection into one step to reduce performance loss and directly output target tracks. Experimental results indicate that, compared with traditional single-frame and multi-frame detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves the detection performance of weak targets while suppressing false alarms. Additionally, interpretable analysis shows that the designed network effectively integrates the utilized features, allowing for accurate associations between targets and false alarms.</description>

      <title>Learning Wideband User Scheduling and Hybrid Precoding with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User scheduling and hybrid precoding in wideband multi-antenna systems have never been learned jointly due to the challenges arising from the massive user combinations on resource blocks (RBs) and the shared analog precoder among RBs. In this paper, we strive to jointly learn the scheduling and precoding policies with graph neural networks (GNNs), which have emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing resource allocation thanks to their potential in generalizing across problem scales. By reformulating the joint optimization problem into an equivalent functional optimization problem for the scheduling and precoding policies, we propose a GNN-based architecture consisting of two cascaded modules to learn the two policies. We discover a same-parameter same-decision (SPSD) property for wireless policies defined on sets, revealing that a GNN cannot well learn the optimal scheduling policy when users have similar channels. This motivates us to develop a sequence of GNNs to enhance the scheduler module. Furthermore, by analyzing the SPSD property, we find when linear aggregators in GNNs impede size generalization. Based on the observation, we devise a novel attention mechanism for information aggregation in the precoder module. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves satisfactory spectral efficiency with short inference time and low training complexity, and is generalizable to the numbers of users, RBs, and antennas at the base station and users.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Scalability of Binary and Ternary CNN Workloads on RRAM-based Compute-in-Memory Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing computational demand of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) necessitates energy-efficient acceleration strategies. Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures based on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) offer a promising solution by reducing data movement and enabling low-power in-situ computations. However, their efficiency is limited by the high cost of peripheral circuits, particularly Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Large crossbars and low ADC resolutions are often used to mitigate this, potentially compromising accuracy. This work introduces novel simulation methods to model the impact of resistive wire parasitics and limited ADC resolution on RRAM crossbars. Our parasitics model employs a vectorised algorithm to compute crossbar output currents with errors below 0.15% compared to SPICE. Additionally, we propose a variable step-size ADC and a calibration methodology that significantly reduces ADC resolution requirements. These accuracy models are integrated with a statistics-based energy model. Using our framework, we conduct a comparative analysis of binary and ternary CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the ternary CNNs exhibit greater resilience to wire parasitics and lower ADC resolution but suffer a 40% reduction in energy efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for optimising RRAM-based CIM accelerators for energy-efficient deep learning.</description>

Abstract: Future 6G networks envisions to blur the line between communication and sensing, leveraging ubiquitous OFDM waveforms for both high throughput data and environmental awareness. In this work, we do a thorough analysis of Communication based Sensing (CommSense) framework that embeds lightweight, PCA based detectors into standard OFDM receivers; enabling real-time, device free detection of passive scatterers (e.g. drones, vehicles etc.) without any extra transmitters. Starting from a realistic three link Rician channel model (direct Tx to Rx, cascaded Tx to Scatterer and Scatterer to Rx), we compare four detectors: the full dimensional Likelihood Ratio Test (Full LRT), PCA based LRT, PCA-SVM with linear and RBF kernels. By projecting N-dimensional CSI onto a P (very less than N) principal component subspace, inference time gets reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the full LRT, while achieving optimal error rates i.e. empirical errors align tightly with the Bhattacharyya error bound and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) approx. equal to 1 for P approx. equal to 10. From the simulated result we have shown LRT based techniques are susceptible to the parameter estimation error, where as SVM is resilient to that. Our results demonstrate that PCA driven detection when paired with lightweight SVMs can deliver fast, accurate, and robust scatterer sensing, paving the way for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</description>

Abstract: A novel procedure for the determination of the optimal group-delay of a Linearly-Constrained Minimum-Variance (LCMV) beamformer is proposed. Two ways of selecting the optimal delay are recommended: the first is the solution that minimizes the noise power; the second is the solution that minimizes the processing delay. The potential of this hitherto unexplored degree of design freedom is explored using simulated Very-High-Frequency (VHF) communication, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) bistatic radar, applications.</description>

      <title>SA-WiSense: A Blind-Spot-Free Respiration Sensing Framework for Single-Antenna Wi-Fi Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing offers a promising technique for contactless human respiration monitoring. A key challenge, however, is the blind spot problem caused by random phase offsets that corrupt the complementarity of respiratory signals. To address the challenge, we propose a single-antenna-Wi-Fi-sensing (SA-WiSense) framework to improve accuracy of human respiration monitoring, robust against random phase offsets. The proposed SA-WiSense framework is cost-efficient, as only a single antenna is used rather than multiple antennas as in the previous works. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable to Internet of Thing (IoT), where most of sensors are equipped with a single antenna. On one hand, we propose a cross-subcarrier channel state information (CSI) ratio (CSCR) based blind spot mitigation approach for IoT, where the ratios of two values of CSI between subcarriers are leveraged to mitigate random phase offsets. We prove that the random phase offsets can be cancelled by the proposed CSCR approach, thereby restoring the inherent complementarity of signals for blind-spot-free sensing. On the other hand, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based subcarrier selection (GASS) approach by formulating an optimization problem in terms of the sensing-signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of CSCR between subcarriers. GA is utilized to solve the formulated optimization problem. We use commodity ESP32 microcontrollers to build an experiment test. The proposed works are validated to achieve an detection rate of 91.2% for respiration monitoring at distances up to 8.0 meters, substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods with a single antenna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As emerging applications demand increasingly higher throughput, IEEE standard 802.11be -- Extremely High Throughput (EHT), also known as Wi-Fi 7, was published on July 22, 2025. It can be used to meet the demand for the throughput of 4K/8K videos up to tens of Gbps and low-latency video applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Wi-Fi 7 not only scales Wi-Fi 6 with doubled bandwidth, but also supports real-time applications, which brings revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi. In this article, we start by introducing the main objectives and timeline of Wi-Fi 7 and then list the latest key techniques which promote the performance improvement of Wi-Fi 7. Finally, we validate the most critical objectives of Wi-Fi 7 -- the potential up to 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency. System-level simulation results suggest that by combining the new techniques, Wi-Fi 7 achieves 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency than Wi-Fi 6.</description>

      <title>Private Counterfactual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two extremely important aspects to be considered when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications. Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of fulfilling this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of both the institution that is providing the explanation as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we propose multiple schemes inspired by private information retrieval (PIR) techniques which ensure the \emph{user's privacy} when retrieving counterfactual explanations. We present a scheme which retrieves the \emph{exact} nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect (information-theoretic) privacy for the user. While the scheme achieves perfect privacy for the user, some leakage on the database is inevitable which we quantify using a mutual information based metric. Furthermore, we propose strategies to reduce this leakage to achieve an advanced degree of database privacy. We extend these schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Since our schemes rely on finite field arithmetic, we empirically validate our schemes on real datasets to understand the trade-off between the accuracy and the finite field sizes. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Edge AI: Realizing Intelligent Perception in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned as two essential and interconnected functions in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. On the one hand, sensing-empowered applications rely on powerful AI models to extract features and understand semantics from ubiquitous wireless sensors. On the other hand, the massive amount of sensory data serves as the fuel to continuously refine edge AI models. This deep integration of sensing and edge AI has given rise to a new task-oriented paradigm known as integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), which features a holistic design approach to communication, AI computation, and sensing for optimal sensing-task performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey for ISEA. We first provide technical preliminaries for sensing, edge AI, and new communication paradigms in ISEA. Then, we study several use cases of ISEA to demonstrate its practical relevance and introduce current standardization and industrial progress. Next, the design principles, metrics, tradeoffs, and architectures of ISEA are established, followed by a thorough overview of ISEA techniques, including digital air interface, over-the-air computation, and advanced signal processing. Its interplay with various 6G advancements, e.g., new physical-layer and networking techniques, are presented. Finally, we present future research opportunities in ISEA, including the integration of foundation models, convergence of ISEA and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), ultra-low-latency ISEA, and practicality issues.</description>

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</description>

      <title>RadioDUN: A Physics-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>
