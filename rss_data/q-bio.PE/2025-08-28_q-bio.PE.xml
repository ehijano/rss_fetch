      <title>Spatiotemporal Determinants of Vector-Borne Disease Outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-borne diseases arise from the coupled dynamics of human mobility and mosquito ecology, producing outbreaks shaped by both spatial distributions and temporal patterns of movement. Here we develop a coarse-grained hub--leaf reduction that isolates the universal principles governing epidemic vulnerability in interconnected populations. By deriving and analyzing the epidemic vulnerability equation, we show how human and vector population ratios, together with mobility parameters that regulate time spent in hub and leaf locations, jointly determine the conditions for outbreak persistence. The analysis reveals that balanced flows of individuals between patches consistently minimize vulnerability, whereas disproportionate concentrations of vectors can shift the dominant risk to specific locations. Across parameter regimes, compensatory mobility emerges as a stabilizing mechanism, while skewed host--vector ratios elevate epidemic risk. These results establish general principles for the spatiotemporal determinants of vector-borne disease spread and provide a theoretical foundation for extending minimal models to more complex epidemiological settings.</description>

      <title>Identifiability, Sensitivity, and Genetic Algorithms in Bacterial Biofilm Selection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress. In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions, they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation. We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Tumorigenesis as a trauma response: the fragmentation of morphogenetic memory drives neoplastic dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.</description>

      <title>Multicritical Infection Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Activity propagation with Hebbian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model including telomerase activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer. In this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of the process. We study theoretical properties of this model, including its long-term behaviour. In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model parameters on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the population of cells.</description>
