      <title>Phase and amplitude modes in the anisotropic Dicke model with matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase and amplitude modes are emergent phenomena that manifest across diverse physical systems, from condensed matter and particle physics to quantum optics. Also called polariton modes, we study their behavior in an anisotropic Dicke model that includes collective matter interactions. We study the low-lying spectrum in the thermodynamic limit via the Holstein-Primakoff transformation and contrast the results with the semiclassical energy surface obtained via coherent states. We also explore the geometric phase for both boson and spin contours in the parameter space as a function of the phases in the system. We unveil novel phenomena due to the unique critical features provided by the interplay between the anisotropy and matter interactions. We expect our results to serve for the observation of phase and amplitude modes in current quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>A photon-interfaced ten qubit quantum network node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We entangle each individual matter-qubit in a register of ten to a separate travelling photon. The qubits are encoded in a string of cotrapped atomic ions. By switching the trap confinement, ions are brought one at a time into the waist of an optical cavity and emit a photon via a laser-driven cavity-mediated Raman transition. The result is a train of photonic-qubits, each near-maximally entangled by their polarisation with a different ion-qubit in the string. An average ion-photon Bell state fidelity of 92(1)% is achieved, for an average probability for detecting each single photon of 9.1(8)%. The technique is directly scalable to larger ion-qubit registers and opens up the near-term possibility of entangling distributed networks of trapped-ion quantum processors, sensing arrays and clocks.</description>

      <title>Topologically Robust Quantum Network Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss quantum network Bell nonlocality in a setting where the network structure is not fully known. More concretely, an honest user may trust their local network topology, but not the structure of the rest of the network, involving distant (and potentially dishonest) parties. We demonstrate that quantum network nonlocality can still be demonstrated in such a setting, hence exhibiting topological robustness. Specifically, we present quantum distributions obtained from a simple network that cannot be reproduced by classical models, even when the latter are based on more powerful networks. In particular, we show that in a large ring network, the knowledge of only a small part of the network structure (involving only 2 or 3 neighbouring parties) is enough to guarantee nonlocality over the entire network. This shows that quantum network nonlocality can be extremely robust to changes in the network topology. Moreover, we demonstrate that applications of quantum nonlocality, such as the black-box certification of randomness and entanglement, are also possible in such a setting.</description>

      <title>Correlating two qubits via common cavity environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of quantum entanglement between a pair of qubits is studied in a cavity-QED platform. The qubit pair is placed inside a common cavity environment. We show that the relative strength of qubit-photon couplings is crucial for establishing inter-qubit entanglement. Resonance as well as off-resonance between the qubits and photon are considered . For off-resonant case we detect a threshold value of coupling ratio, beyond which maximally entangled state is always available. The resonant case displays interesting non-monotonic behavior, where the maximum entanglement peaks at an intermediate coupling ratio. The driven-dissipative dynamics of our model exhibits non-trivial dependence of steady-state entanglement on the drive strength.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Steady-state work extraction from two coupled qubits embedded within equilibrium and non-equilibrium reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work extraction is a fundamental aspect in thermodynamics. In the context of quantum physics, ergotropy quantifies the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from quantum system through cyclic unitary process. In this work, the steady-state ergotropy of two coupled qubit, each interacting locally with its individual boson or fermion reservoir, will be examined. In this work, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios for bosonic and fermionic environments interacting with the qubits will be considered. In scenarios where two coupled qubits embedded within equilibrium boson reservoirs, it has been observed that the temperature of the reservoirs and the inter-qubits interaction strangth act as detrimental factors in work extraction. In the case of fermionic equilibrium reservoirs, it will be observed that ergotropy grows monotonically with the reservoirs chemical potential. In the non-equilibrium boson reservoirs, the temperature difference between the two reservoirs is a destructive factor for ergotropy. In non-equilibrium fermion reservoirs, the situation is somewhat more complicated. For r base chemical potential values that are smaller than the qubit transition frequency, the behavior of ergotropy is non-monotonic. However, for base chemical potential values that are larger than the transition frequency, ergotropy grows monotonically with the reservoirs chemical potential difference. Also, we study the situation in which the coupled qubits are asymmetric. It is observed that the maximum work will be extracted in the situation where the coupled qubits within both boson and fermion reservoirs be symmetric .</description>

      <title>Trainability issues in quantum policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the trainability of Parameterized Quantum circuit-based policies in Reinforcement Learning, an area that has recently seen a surge in empirical exploration. While some studies suggest improved sample complexity using quantum gradient estimation, the efficient trainability of these policies remains an open question. Our findings reveal significant challenges, including standard Barren Plateaus with exponentially small gradients and gradient explosion. These phenomena depend on the type of basis-state partitioning and mapping these partitions onto actions. For a polynomial number of actions, a trainable window can be ensured with a polynomial number of measurements if a contiguous-like partitioning of basis-states is employed. These results are empirically validated in a multi-armed bandit environment.</description>

      <title>Contextuality in anomalous heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such effect can happen due to entanglement, but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios where anomalous heat flow \emph{does} have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined to be the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup where sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by time intervals $(0,\tau_c)$ for a given critical time $\tau_c$, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time $\tau_c$ based on their experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two qutrit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid atom-photon entangling gates via Gaussian soft control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid atom-photon gates play an important role for the realization of a quantum interface capable of mapping atomic states to photons for communication across quantum networks. Here, we propose a feasible theoretical scheme for implementing a hybrid atom-photon controlled-Z gate between an atom and a microwave photon in a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator based on the Gaussian soft control technique. The gate protocol employs a classical auxiliary field that induces an atomic transition between one state of the atomic qubit and Rydberg states for obtaining strong coupling of the atom and microwave resonator. By tailoring the amplitude of this field with Gaussian temporal modulation, the gate performances are improved in various aspects. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the controlled-Z gate based on Gaussian soft control is resilient to the variation of the atom-photon coupling strength, deviation in the gate time, and less sensitive to the Rydberg level shifts caused by stray electric fields.</description>

      <title>Nonclassicality in Two-Mode New Generalized Binomial State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of nonclassical properties of two-mode quantum states is particularly useful in quantum information theory because of the possibilities of obtaining entanglement and other two-mode quantum correlations in these states. Here we have investigated the possibilities of the existence of nonclassicality in a two-mode New generalized binomial state (TMNGBS). Specifically two-mode antibunching, Quadrature squeezing, sum \&amp; difference squeezing, and various entanglement criteria e.g Shchukin-Vogel entanglement criterion, the uncertainty relation of SU(1,1) Algebra and EPR entanglement criterion are explored in two mode particular example of quantum state named as New generalized binomial state. Earlier we studied nonclassicality in single-mode NGBS, here we are extending our study toward the two-mode version of a quantum state. Here we provide the general expressions of moments for a two-mode quantum state (Fock basis) and explore the quantification in a particular example NGBS. It is found that antibunching, squeezing, and SV entanglement are possible with different limits of depending parameters but the entanglement criteria (EPR, SU (1,1) algebra and Cauchy - Schwarz inequality based)for NGBS are not possible. This study opens up the possibility of exploring the two-mode nonclassicality in other states too.</description>

      <title>Approximate Contraction of Arbitrary Tensor Networks with a Flexible and Efficient Density Matrix Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Impact of Measurement Noise on Escaping Saddles in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a frequently used optimization technique in classical machine learning and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). For the implementation of VQE on quantum hardware, the results are always affected by measurement shot noise. However, there are many unknowns about the structure and properties of the measurement noise in VQE and how it contributes to the optimization. In this work, we analyze the effect of measurement noise to the optimization dynamics. Especially, we focus on escaping from saddle points in the loss landscape, which is crucial in the minimization of the non-convex loss function. We find that the escape time (1) decreases as the measurement noise increases in a power-law fashion and (2) is expressed as a function of $\eta/N_s$ where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $N_s$ is the number of measurements. The latter means that the escape time is approximately constant when we vary $\eta$ and $N_s$ with the ratio $\eta/N_s$ held fixed. This scaling behavior is well explained by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is obtained by the continuous-time approximation of the discrete-time SGD. According to the SDE, $\eta/N_s$ is interpreted as the variance of measurement shot noise. This result tells us that we can learn about the optimization dynamics in VQE from the analysis based on the continuous-time SDE, which is theoretically simpler than the original discrete-time SGD.</description>

      <title>Does the full configuration interaction method based on quantum phase estimation with Trotter decomposition satisfy the size consistency condition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09830v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of atoms and molecules are expected to be a promising application for quantum computers, and two important algorithms, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), have been widely studied. The condition that the energy of the dimer consisting of two monomers separated by a large distance should be twice of the energy of the monomer, known as a size consistency, is very important in quantum chemical calculations. Recently, we reported that the size consistency condition can be broken by the Trotterization in the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz in VQE, when the molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer are used (K. Sugisaki et al., J. Comput. Chem., published online; DOI: 10.1002/jcc.27438). It is well known that the full configuration interaction (full-CI) energy is invariant with arbitrary rotations of molecular orbitals, and therefore the QPE-based full-CI in principle satisfies the size consistency. However, Trotterization of the time evolution operator has a chance to break the size consistency conditions. In this work, we investigated whether or not the size consistency condition can be maintained by the Trotterization of the time evolution operator in the QPE-based full-CI calculations. Our numerical simulations revealed that the size consistency of the QPE-based full-CI is not automatically violated by using the molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer, but the use of an appropriate Trotter decomposition condition is crucial to satisfy the size consistency condition. Acceleration of the QPE simulations with sequential addition of ancillary qubits is also reported.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of ultrafast singlet fission in 1D rings towards unit efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is an electronic transition that in the last decade has been under the spotlight for its applications in optoelectronics, from photovoltaics to spintronics. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical advancements, optimising SF in extended solids remains a challenge, due to the complexity of its analysis beyond perturbative methods. Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods. By optimising over a parameter space relevant to organic molecular materials, we identify two classes of solutions that can take SF efficiency beyond 85% in the non-dissipative (coherent) regime, and to 99% when exciton-phonon interactions can be tuned. After discussing the experimental feasibility of the optimised solutions, we conclude by proposing that this approach can be extended to a wider class of optoelectronic optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Three-Receiver Quantum Broadcast Channels: Classical Communication with Quantum Non-unique Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In network communication, it is common in broadcasting scenarios for there to exist a hierarchy among receivers based on information they decode due, for example, to different physical conditions or premium subscriptions. This hierarchy may result in varied information quality, such as higher-quality video for certain receivers. This is modeled mathematically as a degraded message set, indicating a hierarchy between messages to be decoded by different receivers, where the default quality corresponds to a common message intended for all receivers, a higher quality is represented by a message for a smaller subset of receivers, and so forth. We extend these considerations to quantum communication, exploring three-receiver quantum broadcast channels with two- and three-degraded message sets. Our technical tool involves employing quantum non-unique decoding, a technique we develop by utilizing the simultaneous pinching method. We construct one-shot codes for various scenarios and find achievable rate regions relying on various quantum R\'enyi mutual information error exponents. Our investigation includes a comprehensive study of pinching across tensor product spaces, presenting our findings as the asymptotic counterpart to our one-shot codes. By employing the non-unique decoding, we also establish a simpler proof to Marton's inner bound for two-receiver quantum broadcast channels without the need for more involved techniques. Additionally, we derive no-go results and demonstrate their tightness in special cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Gaussian States of Superfluid Helium Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states of phononic systems coupled to light are essential for fundamental studies of single-phonon mechanics and direct applications in quantum technology. Although nonclassical mechanical states have already been demonstrated, more challenging quantum non-Gaussianity of such states remains limited. Using photon counting detection, we propose the quantum non-Gaussian generation of few-phonon states of low-temperature vibrating superfluid Helium. We predict the quantum non-Gaussian depth of such phononic states and investigate their robustness under relevant mechanical heating. As the quality of such phononic states is very high, we confirm a single-phonon bunching capability to further classify such states for future mechanical experiments. Moreover, we predict increasing capability for force sensing and thermometry for increasing heralded phonon numbers.</description>

      <title>Integration of through-sapphire substrate machining with superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate-scale quantum processors. The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, we present a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits. This technique immediately provides a means to scale QPUs with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <title>Genons, Double Covers and Fault-tolerant Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A great deal of work has been done developing quantum codes with varying overhead and connectivity constraints. However, given the such an abundance of codes, there is a surprising shortage of fault-tolerant logical gates supported therein. We define a construction, such that given an input $[[n,k,d]]$ code, yields a $[[2n,2k,\ge d]]$ symplectic double code with naturally occurring fault-tolerant logical Clifford gates. As applied to 2-dimensional $D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$-topological codes with genons (twists) and domain walls, we find the symplectic double is genon free, and of possibly higher genus. Braiding of genons on the original code becomes Dehn twists on the symplectic double. Such topological operations are particularly suited for architectures with all-to-all connectivity, and we demonstrate this experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Graph States by the Properties of Their Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of multi-partite entangled quantum states that are ubiquitous in many networking applications; the study of equivalence relations between graph states under local operations aims to provide methods to relate graph states in networked settings. The problem of determining local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states is in NP, and it remains an open question if efficient general methods are possible. We introduce a family of easy-to-compute LU-invariants based on the marginal structure of the graphs that allow to rule out equivalence of graph states. We show that these invariants can uniquely identify all LU-orbits and entanglement classes of every graph state of 8 qubits or less and discuss how reliable the methods are for more qubit graph states. We also discuss examples of entanglement classes with more nodes, where their marginal structure does not allow us to tell them apart. Additionally, we generalise tools to test local clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states that work by condensing graphs into other graphs of smaller size. We show that statements on the equivalence of the smaller graphs (which are easier to compute) can be used to infer statements on the equivalence of the original, larger graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic symmetries of physical systems have been employed to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of systems, thereby simplifying computations. In this work, we investigate the properties of $\mathcal{M}SU(2^N)$, $\mathcal{M}$-invariant subspaces of the special unitary Lie group $SU(2^N)$ acting on $N$ qubits, for some $\mathcal{M}\subseteq M_{2^N}(\mathbb{C})$. We demonstrate that for certain choices of $\mathcal{M}$, the subset $\mathcal{M}SU(2^N)$ inherits many topological and group properties from $SU(2^N)$. We then present a combinatorial method for computing the dimension of such subspaces when $\mathcal{M}$ is a representation of a permutation group acting on qubits $(GSU(2^N))$, or a Hamiltonian $(H^{(N)}SU(2^N))$. The Kronecker product of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ matrices is employed to construct the Lie algebras associated with different permutation-invariant groups $GSU(2^N)$. Numerical results on the number of dimensions support the the developed theory.</description>

      <title>Intra-QLAN Connectivity: beyond the Physical Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near to mid future, Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) -- the fundamental building block of the Quantum Internet -- will unlike exhibit physical topologies characterized by densely physical connections among the nodes. On the contrary, it is pragmatic to consider QLANs based on simpler, scarcely-connected physical topologies, such as star topologies. This constraint -- if not properly tackled -- will significantly impact the QLAN performance in terms of communication delay and/or overhead. Thankfully, it is possible to create on-demand links between QLAN nodes, without physically deploying them, by properly manipulating a shared multipartite entangled state. Thus, it is possible to build an overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one. In this paper, we address the fundamental issue of engineering the artificial topology of a QLAN to bypass the limitations induced by the physical topology. The designed framework relays only on local operations, without exchanging signaling among the QLAN nodes, which, in turn, would introduce further delays in a scenario very sensitive to the decoherence. Finally, by exploiting the artificial topology, it is proved that the troubleshooting is simplified, by overcoming the single point of failure, typical of classical LAN star topologies.</description>

      <title>Characterizing out-of-distribution generalization of neural networks: application to the disordered Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a promising tool for the detection of phases of matter. However, ML models are also known for their black-box construction, which hinders understanding of what they learn from the data and makes their application to novel data risky. Moreover, the central challenge of ML is to ensure its good generalization abilities, i.e., good performance on data outside the training set. Here, we show how the informed use of an interpretability method called class activation mapping (CAM), and the analysis of the latent representation of the data with the principal component analysis (PCA) can increase trust in predictions of a neural network (NN) trained to classify quantum phases. In particular, we show that we can ensure better out-of-distribution generalization in the complex classification problem by choosing such an NN that, in the simplified version of the problem, learns a known characteristic of the phase. We show this on an example of the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with and without disorder, which turned out to be surprisingly challenging for NNs trained in a supervised way. This work is an example of how the systematic use of interpretability methods can improve the performance of NNs in scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Purcell effect in chiral environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the modification of the spontaneous decay rate in the presence of electromagnetic media and bodies. In this work, we shed light on the dependencies and magnitude of this effect for chiral materials. Using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and Fermi's golden rule, we study a chiral bulk medium with and without local-field corrections, an idealised chiral mirror and a chiral surface. The results imply that the chiral effect is greatest for large transition frequencies, molecules with large optical rotatory strength and media with a strong cross-susceptibility. In the case of a half space, short distances from the molecule to the interface additionally enhance the effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformed coherent states of the Arik-Coon harmonic oscillator as the quantum resource in the post-selected weak measurement. First, we show how the precision of weak measurement is improved significantly due to $q$-deformation. Next, we focus on the role of the interplay between the deformation parameter and the interaction strength on the nonclassical nature of light. In particular, we show that sub-Poissonian photon distribution as characterized by Mandel parameter, photon antibunching effect, and quadrature squeezing are greatly enhanced by $q$-deformation. Our results not only advance the understanding of the fundamentals of $q$-deformed quantum mechanics, but also raise the potential to contribute to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decoherence effects on local quantum Fisher information and quantum coherence in a spin-1/2 Ising-XYZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the effects of decoherence on local quantum Fisher information and quantum coherence dynamics in a spin-1/2 Ising-XYZ chain model with independent reservoirs at zero temperature. Contrasting these effects with those in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XYZ model reveals intricate interactions among quantum coherence, entanglement, and environmental decoherence in spin systems. Analysis of coherence dynamics highlights differences between the original and hybrid models, showcasing increased entanglement due to Ising interactions alongside reduced coherence from environmental redistribution. The local quantum Fisher information proves more resilient than coherence in specific scenarios, emphasizing decoherence is varying impacts on quantum correlations. This research underscores the complexity of quantum coherence dynamics and the crucial role of environmental factors in shaping quantum correlations, providing insights into entanglement and coherence behavior under environmental influences and guiding future studies in quantum information processing and correlation dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) is vital to the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and an algorithm that solves it on a quantum computer could potentially grant exponential space and time complexity speedups. However, the DPEM in 1D has been shown to have trouble being represented as a decomposition in the Pauli basis. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have large numbers of parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an $O(n)$ scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence, providing an exponential speedup over their classical computing counterparts. This project shows that the future of computational fluid dynamics may involve quantum computers to provide significant time and space complexity speedups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10159v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate quench dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain on the IBM quantum computers, calculating the R\'enyi entanglement entropy, the twist order parameter and the Berry phase. The latter two quantities can be deduced from a slow-twist operator defined in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem. The R\'enyi entropy is obtained using a recently developed randomized measurement scheme. The twist order parameter and the Berry phase are measured without the need for additional gates or ancilla qubits. We consider quench protocols in which a trivial initial state evolves dynamically in time under the topological SSH Hamiltonian in the fully dimerized limit (the flat-band limit). During these quenches, there are persistent and periodic oscillations in the time evolution of both entanglement entropy and twist order parameter. Through the implementation of error mitigation techniques using a global depolarizing ansatz and postselection, our simulations on the IBM devices yield results that closely match exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive second quantization scheme for radiative photonic devices. We canonically quantize the continuum of photonic eigenmodes by transforming them into a discrete set of pseudomodes that provide a \textit{complete} and \textit{exact} description of quantum emitters interacting with electromagnetic environments. This method avoids all reservoir approximations, and offers new insights into quantum correlations, accurately capturing all non-Markovian dynamics. This method overcomes challenges in quantizing non-Hermitian systems and is applicable to diverse nanophotonic geometries.</description>

Abstract: We comparatively study three of the most useful quantum information tools to detect quantum critical points (QCPs) when only finite temperature data are available. We investigate quantitatively how the quantum discord, the quantum teleportation based QCP detectors, and the quantum coherence spectrum pinpoint the QCPs of several spin-$1/2$ chains. We work in the thermodynamic limit (infinite number of spins) and with the spin chains in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$. The models here studied are the $XXZ$ model with and without an external longitudinal magnetic field, the Ising transverse model, and the $XY$ model subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy bounds for pure states of rapid decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For pure states of multi-dimensional quantum lattice systems, which in a convenient computational basis have amplitude and phase structure of sufficiently rapid decorrelation, we construct high fidelity approximations of relatively low complexity. These are used for a conditional proof of area-law bounds for the states' entanglement entropy. The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field. Combined with available model-specific information on spin-spin correlations, we establish an area-law type bound on the entanglement in the model's subcritical ground states, valid in all dimensions and up to the model's quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Finite-size analysis of prepare-and-measure and decoy-state QKD via entropy accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important goal in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the task of providing a finite-size security proof without the assumption of collective attacks. For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy accumulation theorem (GEAT), but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-tradeoff functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT, and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-tradeoff function. Our approach also addresses some numerical stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which were not addressed in previous works.</description>

      <title>Operator Space Entangling Power of Quantum Dynamics and Local Operator Entanglement Growth in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator entanglement is a well-established measure of operator complexity across a system bipartition. In this work, we introduce a measure for the ability of a unitary channel to generate operator entanglement, representing an operator-level generalization of the state-space entangling power. This operator space entangling power is demonstrated to be linked to the scrambling properties of the unitary channel via the recently introduced concept of mutual averaged non-commutativity of quantum operator algebras. An upper bound for the operator space entangling power is identified, corresponding to unitary channels with scrambling properties akin to those of typical unitaries. Additionally, for Hamiltonian dynamics, we find that the short-time growth rate of the operator space entangling power matches the Gaussian scrambling rate of the bipartite out-of-time-order-correlator, establishing a direct link between information scrambling and operator entanglement generation for short time scales. Finally, we examine the average growth of local operator entanglement across a symmetric bipartition of a spin-chain. For dual-unitary circuits, a combination of analytical and numerical investigations demonstrates that the average growth of local operator entanglement exhibits two distinct regimes in relation to the operator space entangling power of the building-block gate.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of noise and nonlinearity in Kerr systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address characterization of lossy and dephasing channels in the presence of self-Kerr interaction using coherent probes. In particular, we investigate the ultimate bounds to precision in the joint estimation of loss and nonlinearity and of dephasing and nonlinearity. To this aim, we evaluate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), and compare the symmetric quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCR) to the bound obtained with Fisher information matrix (FIM) of feasible quantum measurements, i.e., homodyne and double-homodyne detection. For lossy Kerr channels, our results show the loss characterization is enhanced in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, especially in the relevant limit of small losses and low input energy, whereas the estimation of nonlinearity itself is unavoidably degraded by the presence of loss. In the low energy regime, homodyne detection of a suitably optimized quadrature represents a nearly optimal measurement. The Uhlmann curvature does not vanish, therefore loss and nonlinearity can be jointly estimated only with the addition of intrinsic quantum noise. For dephasing Kerr channels, the QFIs of the two parameters are independent of the nonlinearity, and therefore no enhancement is observed. Homodyne and double-homodyne detection are suboptimal for the estimation of dephasing and nearly optimal for nonlinearity. Also in this case, the Uhlmann curvature is nonzero, proving that the parameters cannot be jointly estimated with maximum precision.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Mechanism and Beyond: Lessons from a Holographic Superfluid Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid phase transition dynamics and associated spontaneous vortex formation with the crossing of the critical temperature in a disk geometry is studied in the framework of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence by solving the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model in an $AdS_4$ black hole. For a slow quench, the vortex density admits a universal scaling law with the cooling rate as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), while for fast quenches, the density shows a universal scaling behavior as a function of the final temperature, that lies beyond the KZM prediction. The vortex number distribution in both the power-law and saturation regimes can be approximated by a normal distribution. However, the study of the universal scaling of the cumulants reveals non-normal features and indicates that vortex statistics in the newborn superfluid is best described by the Poisson binomial distribution, previously predicted in the KZM regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 240602 (2020)]. This is confirmed by studying the cumulant scalings as a function of the quench time and the quench depth. Our work supports the existence of a universal defect number distribution that accommodates the KZM scaling, its breakdown at fast quenches, and the additional universal scaling laws as a function of the final value of the control parameter.</description>

      <title>On the Relative Nature of Quantum Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we argue against the interpretation that underlies the "Standard" account of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) that was established during the 1930s by Niels Bohr and Paul Dirac. Ever since, following this orthodox narrative, physicists have dogmatically proclaimed -- quite regardless of the deep contradictions and problems -- that the the theory of quanta describes a microscopic realm composed of elementary particles (such as electrons, protons and neutrons) which underly our macroscopic world composed of tables, chairs and dogs. After critically addressing this atomist dogma still present today in contemporary (quantum) physics and philosophy, we present a new understanding of quantum individuals defined as the minimum set of relations within a specific degree of complexity capable to account for all relations within that same degree. In this case, quantum individuality is not conceived in absolute terms but -- instead -- as an objectively relative concept which even though depends of the choice of bases and factorizations remain nonetheless part of the same invariant representation.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We find that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximum response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>The polarization hierarchy for polynomial optimization over convex bodies, with applications to nonnegative matrix rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a convergent family of outer approximations for the problem of optimizing polynomial functions over convex bodies subject to polynomial constraints. This is achieved by generalizing the polarization hierarchy, which has previously been introduced for the study of polynomial optimization problems over state spaces of $C^*$-algebras, to convex cones in finite dimensions. If the convex bodies can be characterized by linear or semidefinite programs, then the same is true for our hierarchy. Convergence is proven by relating the problem to a certain de Finetti theorem for general probabilistic theories, which are studied as possible generalizations of quantum mechanics. We apply the method to the problem of nonnegative matrix factorization, and in particular to the nested rectangles problem. A numerical implementation of the third level of the hierarchy is shown to give rise to a very tight approximation for this problem.</description>

Abstract: The Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time is studied in a gauge-fixing scheme which interpolates between the covariant gauge and light-cone gauge, the interpolating gauge-fixing. The ultraviolet finiteness of the theory is proved via the Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) algebraic renormalization procedure, which allows us to demonstrate the vanishing of all $\beta$-functions and all anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>On the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model with scrambling interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model by taking into account the interactions between the collapsing matter and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon. By utilizing a scrambling unitary operator to model these interactions, our direct calculations suggest that the information is almost lost during the process of black hole evaporation. We then proceed to employ the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy for information retrieval. Although we observe a finite improvement in decoding fidelity, it does not reach unity. This indicates that the issue of unitarity in black hole evaporation may not be fully resolved within the framework of the final state model.</description>

      <title>Resonant analogue configurations in atomic condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a contribution to a memorial volume, we provide a comprehensive discussion of resonant configurations in analogue gravity, focusing on its implementation in atomic condensates and combining review features with original insights and calculations. In particular, we analyze the analogues of the Andreev and Hawking effects using a microscopic description based on the Bogoliubov approximation. We contemplate several resonant scenarios whose efficiency to enhance anomalous scattering processes is compared to that of non-resonant setups. The presence of quantum signatures in analogue configurations, such as the violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities or entanglement, is analyzed, observing that resonant configurations highly increase the entanglement signal, especially for the Andreev effect. We also discuss how these results have served as inspiration for the rapidly expanding field of quantum information in high-energy colliders. Finally, we study the physics of black-hole lasers as further examples of resonant analogue structures, distinguishing three stages in its time evolution. For short times, we compute the linear and non-linear spectrum for different models. For intermediate times, we generalize the current analysis of the BHL-BCL crossover. For long times, we discuss the emerging concept of spontaneous Floquet state and its potential implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($\nu_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $\nu_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>The quantumness of relic gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

Abstract: A quantum system and a thermal bath can reach thermal equilibrium through an interaction, whereupon the system acquires the same temperature as the bath. But how does a delocalised quantum system thermalise with a bath whose local temperature varies, as, for example, in the Tolman effect? Here we formulate two scenarios in which the notion of a ``superposition of temperatures'' may arise. First: a probe interacting with two different baths dependent on the state of another quantum system (control). Second: a probe interacting with a single bath whose purified state is a superposition of states corresponding to different temperatures. We show that the two scenarios are fundamentally different and can be operationally distinguished. Moreover, we show that the probe does not in general thermalise even when the involved temperatures are equal, and that the final probe state is sensitive to the specific realisation of the thermalising channels. Our models may be applied to scenarios involving joint quantum, gravitational, and thermodynamic phenomena, and explain some recent results found in quantum intereference of relativistic probes thermalising with Unruh or Hawking radiation. Finally, we show that our results are reproduced in partial and pre-thermalisation processes, and thus our approach and conclusions hold beyond the idealised scenarios, where thermalisation is incomplete.</description>

Abstract: Committing to information is a central task in cryptography, where a party (typically called a prover) stores a piece of information (e.g., a bit string) with the promise of not changing it. This information can be accessed by another party (typically called the verifier), who can later learn the information and verify that it was not meddled with. Merkle trees are a well-known construction for doing so in a succinct manner, in which the verifier can learn any part of the information by receiving a short proof from the honest prover. Despite its significance in classical cryptography, there was no quantum analog of the Merkle tree. A direct generalization using the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) does not seem to be secure. In this work, we propose the quantum Merkle tree. It is based on what we call the Quantum Haar Random Oracle Model (QHROM). In QHROM, both the prover and the verifier have access to a Haar random quantum oracle $G$ and its inverse.
  Using the quantum Merkle tree, we propose a succinct quantum argument for the Gap-$k$-Local-Hamiltonian problem. Assuming the Quantum PCP conjecture is true, this succinct argument extends to all of QMA. This work raises a number of interesting open research problems.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Quantum Measurements and Operations of Scattering Type under the Energy Conservation Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is important to improve the accuracy of quantum measurements and operations both in engineering and fundamental physics. It is known, however, that the achievable accuracy of measurements and unitary operations are generally limited by conservation laws according to the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem (WAY theorem) and its generalizations. Although many researches have extended the WAY theorem quantitatively, most of them, as well as the original WAY theorem, concern only additive conservation laws like the angular momentum conservation law. In this paper, we explore the limitation incurred by the energy conservation law, which is universal but is one of the non-additive conservation laws. We present a lower bound for the error of a quantum measurement using a scattering process satisfying the energy conservation law. We obtain conditions that a control system Hamiltonian must fulfill in order to implement a controlled unitary gate with zero error when a scattering process is considered. We also show the quantitative relationship between the upper bound of the gate fidelity of a controlled unitary gate and the energy fluctuation of systems when a target system and a control system are both one qubit.</description>

Abstract: An approach to modeling the dynamics of x-ray amplified spontaneous emission and superfluorescence -- the phenomenon of collective x-ray emission initiated by intense pulses of X-ray Free Electron Lasers -- is developed based on stochastic partial differential equations. The equations are derived from first principles, and the relevant approximations, derivation steps, and extensions specific to stimulated x-ray emission are presented. The resulting equations take the form of three-dimensional generalized Maxwell-Bloch equations augmented with noise terms for both field and atomic variables. The derived noise terms possess specific correlation properties that enable the correct reconstruction of spontaneous emission. Consequently, the developed theoretical formalism is universally suitable for describing all stages of stimulated x-ray emission: spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and superfluorescence. We present numerical examples that illustrate various properties of the emitted field, including spatio-temporal coherence, spectral-angular and polarization characteristics. We anticipate that the proposed theoretical framework will establish a robust foundation for interpreting measurements in stimulated x-ray emission spectroscopy, modeling x-ray laser oscillators, and describing other experiments leveraging x-ray superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>An entanglement witness and an effective criterion for bipartite states of different dimensions</title>

Abstract: We present a simple approach for generation of a diverse set of positive maps between spaces of different dimensions. The proposed method enables the construction of Entanglement Witnesses tailored for systems in $d_1 \times d_2$ dimensions. We then show how application of this entanglement witness to a general density matrix leads to a simple calculable criterion in closed form. As a support for the power of this criterion, we apply it to a variety of (one-parameter) PPT entangled states and show that the ranges of the parameters where these states are entangled are much larger than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization of qubits via dynamical Casimir effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the synchronization of qubits induced by the dynamical Casimir effect in an atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics system. Our investigation revolves around a pragmatic configuration of a quantum system, where two superconducting qubits are coupled to a shared coplanar waveguide resonator terminated at one end by a superconducting quantum interference device. The theoretical analyses of the system dynamics reveal sufficient conditions for ensuring synchronization which are anticipated to be accomplished by photon generation in the resonator. By numerically analyzing the time evolution of the system, we confirm that the conditions are satisfied by photon generation via the dynamical Casimir effect, resulting in qubit synchronization. Notably, we unveil a remarkable feature that is unique to synchronization induced by the dynamical Casimir effect: the differences in the initial states of qubits and the differences in the coupling strengths of qubits to an electromagnetic field affect the synchronization independently without overlap between these factors.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning pulses for transmon qubit entangling gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utility of a quantum computer depends heavily on the ability to reliably perform accurate quantum logic operations. For finding optimal control solutions, it is of particular interest to explore model-free approaches, since their quality is not constrained by the limited accuracy of theoretical models for the quantum processor - in contrast to many established gate implementation strategies. In this work, we utilize a continuous-control reinforcement learning algorithm to design entangling two-qubit gates for superconducting qubits; specifically, our agent constructs cross-resonance and CNOT gates without any prior information about the physical system. Using a simulated environment of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling transmon qubits, we demonstrate the capability to generate novel pulse sequences that outperform the standard cross-resonance gates in both fidelity and gate duration, while maintaining a comparable susceptibility to stochastic unitary noise. We further showcase an augmentation in training and input information that allows our agent to adapt its pulse design abilities to drifting hardware characteristics, importantly with little to no additional optimization. Our results exhibit clearly the advantages of unbiased adaptive-feedback learning-based optimization methods for transmon gate design.</description>

      <title>Algebra of Nonlocal Boxes and the Collapse of Communication Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant computers to evaluate a function f(X,Y), where the strings X and Y are distributed to the first and second computer respectively, under the constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean function f can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal boxes remains elusive.
  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the "product of boxes" $P\boxtimes Q$, and we show related associativity and commutativity results. This gives rise to the notion of the "orbit of a box", unveiling surprising geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism of distilled boxes. The power of this new framework is that it allows us to prove previously-reported numerical observations concerning the best way to wire consecutive boxes, and to numerically and analytically recover recently-identified noisy PR boxes that collapse communication complexity for different types of noise models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure and Information Protection in Noisy Hybrid Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions, the influence of quantum noises, which are inherent in real physical systems, is of great importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally uncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and information protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the system follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$ represents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\text{eff}} \sim q^{-1}$. More importantly, the information protection timescales of the steady states are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Noise-Aware Classical Optimizer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key component of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is the choice of classical optimizer employed to update the parameterization of an ansatz. It is well recognized that quantum algorithms will, for the foreseeable future, necessarily be run on noisy devices with limited fidelities. Thus, the evaluation of an objective function (e.g., the guiding function in the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) or the expectation of the electronic Hamiltonian in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)) required by a classical optimizer is subject not only to stochastic error from estimating an expected value but also to error resulting from intermittent hardware noise. Model-based derivative-free optimization methods have emerged as popular choices of a classical optimizer in the noisy VQA setting, based on empirical studies. However, these optimization methods were not explicitly designed with the consideration of noise. In this work we adapt recent developments from the ``noise-aware numerical optimization'' literature to these commonly used derivative-free model-based methods. We introduce the key defining characteristics of these novel noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods that separate them from standard model-based methods. We study an implementation of such noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods and compare its performance on demonstrative VQA simulations to classical solvers packaged in \texttt{scikit-quant}.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Preparing Quantum Squeezed States Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme leveraging reinforcement learning to engineer control fields for generating non-classical states. It is exemplified by the application to prepare spin-squeezed states for an open collective spin model where a linear control field is designed to govern the dynamics. The reinforcement learning agent determines the temporal sequence of control pulses, commencing from a coherent spin state in an environment characterized by dissipation and dephasing. Compared to the constant control scenario, this approach provides various control sequences maintaining collective spin squeezing and entanglement. It is observed that denser application of the control pulses enhances the performance of the outcomes. However, there is a minor enhancement in the performance by adding control actions. The proposed strategy demonstrates increased effectiveness for larger systems. Thermal excitations of the reservoir are detrimental to the control outcomes. Feasible experiments are suggested to implement this control proposal based on the comparison with the others. The extensions to continuous control problems and another quantum system are discussed. The replaceability of the reinforcement learning module is also emphasized. This research paves the way for its application in manipulating other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Beating one bit of communication with quantum correlations in smaller dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a consequence of Bell's theorem, the statistics of measurements on some entangled states cannot be simulated with local hidden variables alone. The amount of communication that must be supplied is an intuitive quantifier of nonclassicality. While it is obvious that this amount can be very large in general, it has been surprisingly difficult to find simple examples of quantum correlations, whose simulation requires more than one bit of communication. In this paper, we report the simplest example to date, which lives in the $(5,2,5,5)$ Bell scenario [the previously known smallest case living in the $(7,3,16,16)$ scenario]. The proof is built on the observation that finding the largest 1-bit score is equivalent to finding the bipartition of the inputs, in which the sum of the local scores of the two subgames is maximal.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: Critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and Swing-UP of the quantum EmitteR population (SUPER) swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>

Abstract: Quantum optimal control is a set of methods for designing time-varying electromagnetic fields to perform operations in quantum technologies. This tutorial paper introduces the basic elements of this theory based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, in a physicist-friendly way. An analogy with classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is proposed to present the main results used in this field. Emphasis is placed on the different numerical algorithms to solve a quantum optimal control problem. Several examples ranging from the control of two-level quantum systems to that of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice are studied in detail, using both analytical and numerical methods. Codes based on shooting method and gradient-based algorithms are provided. The connection between optimal processes and the quantum speed limit is also discussed in two-level quantum systems. In the case of BEC, the experimental implementation of optimal control protocols is described, both for two-level and many-level cases, with the current constraints and limitations of such platforms. This presentation is illustrated by the corresponding experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods to find the limits to finite-time single photon extraction from emitter-cavity systems. We first establish analytic upper and lower bounds on the maximum extraction probability from a canonical $\Lambda$-system before developing a numeric method to optimise generic output probabilities from $\Lambda$-systems generalised to multiple ground states. We use these methods to study the limits to finite-time photon extraction and the wavepackets that satisfy them, finding that using an optimised wavepacket ranging between a sinusoidal and exponentially decaying profile can considerably reduce photon duration for a given extraction efficiency. We further optimise the rates of quantum protocols requiring emitter-photon correlation to obtain driving-independent conclusions about the effect of system parameters on success probability. We believe that these results and methods will provide valuable tools and insights for the development of cavity-based single photon sources combining high efficiency and high rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography scheme based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed "dual-unitary shadow tomography" (DUST). For this we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits. Our results are robust to finite-size effects due to the chirality of dual-unitary brick-wall circuits.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the non-PT symmetry phase of the Swanson Hamiltonian in the framework of the Complex Scaling Method. By constructing a bi-orthogonality relation, we apply the formalism of the response function to analyse the time evolution of different initial wave packages. The Wigner Functions and mean value of operators are evaluated as a function of time. We analyse in detail the time evolution in the neighbourhood of Exceptional Points. We derive a continuity equation for the system. We compare the results obtained using the Complex Scaling Method to the ones obtained by working in a Rigged Hilbert Space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4$\pi$ coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly eight higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the entanglement evolution of three-qubit states in the presence of a spin chain environment. Utilizing negativity as a metric for entanglement assessment, we focus on the GHZ, W, and W_zeta quantum states as the initial system states. We explore and analyze the entanglement dynamics of these states based on various parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of quantum entanglement using the negativity criterion for the W_zeta quantum state. We investigate changes in negativity in terms of anisotropy parameters, gamma, the strength of the external magnetic field applied to the spin chain, eta, the triple interaction strength, alpha. We examine how these parameters affect the entanglement properties of the system and discuss the implications for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols. By analyzing the negativity of the W_zeta state under different conditions, we gain insights into the behaviour of entanglement in complex quantum systems. Our results shed light on the intricate interplay between various factors that influence quantum entanglement and provide a foundation for further investigations in this field of research.</description>

      <title>Cooperative decay of an ensemble of atoms in a one-dimensional chain with a single excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approximated expression of the cooperative decay rate of a one-dimensional chain of N two-level atoms in the single-excitation configuration. From it, the interference nature of superradiance and subradiance arises naturally, without the need of solving the eigenvalue problem of the atom-atom interaction Green function. The cooperative decay rate can be interpreted as the imaginary part of the expectation value of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system, evaluated over a generalized Dicke state of N atoms in the single-excitation manifold. Whereas the subradiant decay rate is zero for an infinite chain, it decreases as 1/N for a finite chain. A simple approximated expression for the cooperative decay rate is obtained as a function of the lattice constant d and the atomic number N. The results are obtained first for the scalar model and then extended to the vectorial light model, assuming all the dipoles aligned.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction matching for solving quantum many-body problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations play an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions to quantum chemistry and from atomic and molecular systems to nuclear physics. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing a new approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in various models of quantum field theory: free massive bosons and fermions on flat space and on spheres, holographic models, and lattice models with the UV-cutoff. In certain cases we find asymptotic behavior of Lanczos coefficients, which goes beyond previously observed universality. We confirm that in all cases the exponential growth of Krylov complexity satisfies the conjectural inequality, which generalizes the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. We discuss temperature dependence of Lanczos coefficients and note that the relation between the growth of Lanczos coefficients and chaos may only hold for the sufficiently late, truly asymptotic regime governed by the physics at the UV cutoff. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show scenarios when Krylov complexity in quantum field theory behaves qualitatively differently from the holographic complexity.</description>

Abstract: High-aspect-ratio mechanical resonators are pivotal in precision sensing, from macroscopic gravitational wave detectors to nanoscale acoustics. However, fabrication challenges and high computational costs have limited the length-to-thickness ratio of these devices, leaving a largely unexplored regime in nano-engineering. We present nanomechanical resonators that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore this expanded design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive centimeter-scale design optimization. By employing delicate nanofabrication techniques, our approach ensures high-yield realization, experimentally confirming room-temperature quality factors close to theoretical predictions. The synergy between nanofabrication, design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens a solid-state path to room-temperature quality factors approaching 10 billion at kilohertz mechanical frequencies -- comparable to the performance of leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical Hermitian continuous media, the spectral-flow index of topological modes is linked to the bulk topology via index theorem. However, the interface between two bulks is usually non-Hermitian due to the inhomogeneities of system parameters. We show that the connection between topological modes and bulk topology still exists despite the non-Hermiticity at the interface if the system is endowed with PT symmetry. The theoretical framework developed is applied to the Hall magnetohydrodynamic model to identify a topological mode called topological Alfv\'{e}n-sound wave in magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmon: A Qubit-Based Sensor for meV Scale Phonons and Single THz Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With great interest from the quantum computing community, an immense amount of R&amp;D effort has been invested into improving superconducting qubits. The technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be directly applied to applications for ultra-low threshold particle detectors, e.g. low-mass dark matter and far-IR photon sensing. We propose a novel sensor based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as SQUATs: Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmons. We detail the operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that with minimal R&amp;D effort, solid-state based detectors patterned with these sensors can achieve sensitivity to single THz photons, and sensitivity to $1\,\mathrm{meV}$ phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the $\mu\mathrm{s}$ timescale.</description>

      <title>Local quenches in fracton field theory: Lieb-Robinson bound, non-causal dynamics and fractal excitation patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short- and long-range p-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short-range, as well as long-range p-wave pairing. Here, the non-Hermiticity is introduced through the onsite potential. A comprehensive analysis of several critical aspects of this system is conducted, which includes eigenspectra, topological properties, localization properties, and the transition from real to complex energies. Specifically, we observe the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the case of short-range pairing, whereas massive Dirac modes emerge in the case of long-range pairing. More importantly, for the case of short-range pairing, we observe two simultaneous phase transitions or double phase transitions: topological and multifractal to localized phase. On the other hand, in the case of the long-range pairing, the topological and multifractal to localized transitions do not coincide. However, for both ranges of pairing, we identify a double phase transition where delocalized (or metallic) to a critical multifractal state is accompanied by an unconventional shift from real to complex energies. Unlike the short-range pairing case, we observe mobility edges in the long-range pairing case.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of reacting flows via Hamiltonian simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the quantum computing of reacting flows by simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics. The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in combustion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04069v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>
