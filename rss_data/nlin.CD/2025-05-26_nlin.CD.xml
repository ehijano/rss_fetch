      <title>Boosting quantum efficiency by reducing complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of energy storage at the nanoscale, exploring the notion of \textit{quantum advantage} implies walking on the thin line at the boundary between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which underpins our conventional understanding of battery devices. With no classical analogue, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has emerged in the last years as a promising platform to boost charging and storage efficiency thanks to its highly-entangling dynamics. Here, we explore how the robustness of this setup by considering the sparse version of the SYK model, showing that, as long as chaos is not completely broken, reducing its complexity may lead to more efficient quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>The Upward-Driven Disk, a Steadily Forced Chaotic Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An "upward-driven disk" is a novel mechanical device built from LEGO parts. A circular disk is suspended from the point where it is sandwiched between two wheels, making it free to oscillate as a pendulum, but the location of that suspension point on the disk changes with time due to a steady upward driving force applied by rotation of one of the wheels. The pendulum can dynamically flip between hanging downward and being inverted. Depending on the upward drive and the initial conditions, the disk can exhibit steady rotation, periodic motion, or chaotic motion (and some of these for the same drive). This device serves as an easy-to-visualize analog of chaotic phenomena in other physical systems. Most notably, the upward driven disk mimics a simplified version of the celebrated Lorenz equations that are frequently used to describe fluid convection.</description>

      <title>The Hamiltonian of Poly-matrix Zero-sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</description>
