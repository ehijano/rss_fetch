      <title>Data-driven MHD Simulation of the Formation of a Magnetic Flux Rope and an Inclined Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic events are caused by the release of magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere. To understand their initiating physical mechanisms, the dynamics of the coronal magnetic fields must be studied. Unfortunately, the dominant mechanisms are still unclear due to lack of direct measurements. Numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can reproduce the dynamical evolution of solar coronal magnetic field providing a useful tool to explore flare initiation. Data-driven MHD simulations, in which the time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic field is used as the simulation boundary condition, can explore different mechanisms. To investigate the accumulation of free magnetic energy through to a solar eruption, we simulated the first of several large flares in NOAA Active Region 11283. We used a data-driven model (Kaneko et al 2021) that was governed by zero-beta MHD, focusing on the free magnetic energy accumulation prior to the M5.3 flare (September 6, 01:59 UT, 2011). We reproduced the flare-associated eruption following the formation of twisted magnetic fields, or a magnetic flux rope (MFR), formed by photospheric motions at its footpoints. We found that the eruption was first triggered by the growth of the torus instability. The erupting MFR caused magnetic reconnections with neighboring magnetic field lines located along the direction of the eruption. Using the simulation results and an axial-radial decay index centered on the MFR, we find a natural explanation for the inclination of the eruption and a possible approach to predict the direction of solar eruptive events.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae Research: Past, Present, and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the evolution of our understanding of the planetary nebulae phenomenon and their place in the scheme of stellar evolution. The historical steps leading to our current understanding of central star evolution and nebular formation are discussed. Recent optical imaging, X-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, millimeter wave, radio observations have led to a much more complex picture of the structure of planetary nebulae. The optically bright regions have multiple shell structures (rims, shells, crowns, and haloes), which can be understood within the interacting winds framework. However, the physical mechanism responsible for bipolar and multipolar structures that emerged during the proto-planetary nebulae phase is yet to be identified. Our morphological classifications of planetary nebulae are hampered by the effects of sensitivity, orientation, and field-of-view coverage, and the fraction of bipolar or multipolar nebulae may be much higher than commonly assumed. The optically bright bipolar lobes may represent low-density, ionization-bounded cavities carved out of a neutral envelope by collimated fast winds. Planetary nebulae are sites of active synthesis of complex organic compounds, suggesting that planetary nebulae play a major role in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. Possible avenues of future advancement are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ancient nova shells of RX Pup indicate evolution of mass transfer rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RX Pup is a symbiotic binary which experienced a nova outburst in the 1970's. Here we report a discovery of a ~1300 year old nova shell around the system and a possible detection of a ~7000 year old nova shell. Together with the nova shell ejected in the 1970's this makes RX Pup the first system with three nova shells observed. This triad of eruptions suggests a change in the nova recurrence time. The most likely explanation is an alteration in the mass transfer rate attributed to evolutionary changes of the mass-donor in the system. Notably, comparative analyses with theoretical models indicate an increase in the average mass transfer rate by a factor of three over the past 10,000 years. This makes RX Pup a unique system, which allows us to probe millenium-scale evolution of mass transfer rates in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in solar data-driven MHD simulations of the formation and evolution of CME flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections are physical phenomena related to magnetic flux ropes carrying electric current. A magnetic flux rope is a key structure for solar eruptions, and when it carries a southward magnetic field component when propagating to the Earth. It is the primary driver of strong geomagnetic storms. As a result, developing a numerical model capable of capturing the entire progression of a flux rope, from its inception to its eruptive phase, is crucial for forecasting adverse space weather. The existence of such flux ropes is revealed by the presence of sigmoids in active regions or hot channels by observations from space and ground instruments. After proposing cartoons in 2D, potential, linear, non-linear-force-free-field (NLFFF) and non-force-free-field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, 3D numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation models were developed, first in a static configuration and later dynamic data-driven MHD models using high resolution observed vector magnetograms. This paper reviews a few recent developments in data-driven mode, such as the time-dependent magneto-frictional (TMF) and thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Hereafter, to demonstrate the capacity of these models to reveal the physics of observations, we present the results for three events explored in our group: 1. the eruptive X1.0 flare on 28 October 2021; 2. the filament eruption on 18 August 2022; and 3. the confined X2.2 flare on 6 September 2017. These case studies validate the ability of data-driven models to retrieve observations, including the formation and eruption of flux ropes, 3D magnetic reconnection, CME three-part structures and the failed eruption. Based on these results, we provide some arguments for the formation mechanisms of flux ropes, the physical nature of the CME leading front, and the constraints of failed eruptions.</description>

      <title>Density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that under solar coronal conditions, drift waves may contribute to coronal heating. Specific properties of the drift waves to be expected in the solar corona have, however, not yet been determined using more advanced numerical models. We investigate the linear properties of density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar coronal plasma using gyrokinetic ion-electron simulations with the gyrokinetic code GENE, solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in five dimensions assuming a simple slab geometry. We determine the frequencies and growth rates of the coronal density gradient-driven drift waves with changing plasma parameters, such as the electron \b{eta} , the density gradient, the magnetic shear and additional temperature gradients. To investigate the influence of the finite Larmor radius effect on the growth and structure of the modes, we also compare the gyrokinetic simulation results to those obtained from drift-kinetics. In most of the investigated conditions, the drift wave has positive growth rates that increase with increasing density gradient and decreasing \b{eta} . In the case of increasing magnetic shear, we find that from a certain point, the growth rate reaches a plateau. Depending on the considered reference environment, the frequencies and growth rates of these waves lie on the order of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. These values correspond to the observed solar wind density fluctuations near the Sun detected by WISPR, currently of unexplained origin. As a next step, nonlinear simulations are required to determine the expected fluctuation amplitudes and the plasma heating resulting from this mechanism.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-21js: A multi-year transit of a ringed disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early-type star ASASSN-21js started to fade in 2021, as was detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, undergoing a multi-year eclipse that is still underway. We interpret this event as being due to a structured disc of material transiting in front of the star. The disc is in orbit around a substellar object with the mass and luminosity of a brown dwarf or smaller. We want to determine the expected duration and ending date of the eclipse. We modelled a tilted and inclined azimuthally symmetric ring system around an unseen companion and calculated the resulting time-varying light curve as the object transited in front of the star. We made an initial estimate of the ring parameters and used these as inputs to an MCMC algorithm to determine the geometric properties of the rings with associated uncertainties. The model most consistent with the light curve to date is a two-ring system at high inclination with respect to the line of sight that has a semi-major axis of 71.6 stellar radii. With an estimate of the stellar radius, the transverse velocity is around 0.7 km/s, which if bound to the star is an orbit with a semi-major axis of around 13000 au, placing it in the Oort cloud of the parent star. The transit is ongoing and will finish around MJD 61526 (May 1 2027). We encourage the community to continue observing this object in order to understand its properties.</description>

      <title>Five new eclipsing binaries with low-mass companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise space-based photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite results in a huge number of exoplanetary candidates. However, the masses of these objects are unknown and must be determined by ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations, frequently revealing the companions to be low-mass stars rather than exoplanets. We present the first orbital and stellar parameter solutions for five such eclipsing binary-star systems using radial-velocity follow-up measurements together with spectral-energy-distribution solutions. TOI-416 and TOI-1143 are totally eclipsing F+M star systems with well-determined secondary masses, radii, and temperatures. TOI-416 is a circular system with an F6 primary and a secondary with a mass of $M_2={0.131(8)}{M_\odot}$. TOI-1143 consists of an F6 primary with an $M_2={0.142(3)}{M_\odot}$ secondary on an eccentric orbit with a third companion. With respect to the other systems, TOI-1153 shows ellipsoidal variations, TOI-1615 contains a pulsating primary, and TOI-1788 has a spotted primary, while all have moderate mass ratios of 0.2-0.4. However, these systems are in a grazing configuration, which limits their full description. The parameters of TOI-416B and TOI-1143B are suitable for the calibration of the radius-mass relation for dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Apsidal motion and TESS light curves of three southern close eccentric eclipsing binaries: GM Nor, V397 Pup, and PT Vel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New ground-based and space-based photometric data have been obtained and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of three detached early-type and southern-hemisphere eccentric eclipsing binaries GM Nor (P = 1.88 d, e = 0.05), V397 Pup (3.00, 0.30), and PT Vel (1.80, 0.12). Their TESS observations in several sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. As a result, new accurate photoelectric times of minimum light have been obtained. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values for the elements of apsidal motion were obtained. Using ESO archive spectroscopy, for V397 Pup, the precise absolute parameters were newly derived: M1 = 3.076(35) M$\odot$, M2 = 2.306(35) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.711(55) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.680(55) R$\odot$. For PT Vel the absolute dimensions were improved: M1 = 2.204(25) M$\odot$, M2 = 1.638(25) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.108(30) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.605(30) R$\odot$. For GM Nor, the less accurate absolute parameters based on the light curve analysis were evaluated: M1 = 1.94(15) M$\odot$, M2 = 1.84(14) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.27(20) R$\odot$, R2 = 2.25(20) R$\odot$. We found more precise and relatively short periods of apsidal motion of about 80, 335, and 160 years, along with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.524, -2.361, and -2.563, for GM Nor, V397 Pup, and PT Vel, respectively. Relativistic effects are small but not negligible, making up to 10\% of the total apsidal motion rate in all systems. No marks of the presence of the third body were revealed in the light curves, on the O-C diagrams, or in the reduced spectra of the eccentric systems studied here.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Perspective of the Unique Magnetic Binary- $\epsilon$ Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\epsilon$ Lupi A (HD 136504) system stands out among magnetic massive binaries as the only short-period binary system in which both components have detectable magnetic fields. The proximity of the magnetospheres of the components leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic pulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We observed this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital period. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron, showing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show significantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft X-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is explained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic reconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant short-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system can be an ideal target to study magnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- V: The Ultracool Dwarf Companion catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Ultracool Dwarf Companion Catalogue of 278 multiple systems, 32 of which are newly discovered, each with at least one spectroscopically confirmed Ultracool Dwarf, within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. This catalogue is compiled using the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars for stellar primaries and the Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample for low-mass companions and includes 241 doubles, 33 triples, and 4 higher-order systems established from positional, proper motion, and parallax constraints. The catalogue seeks to identify probable benchmark systems within 100 pc to obtain model-independent astrophysical parameters of Ultracool Dwarfs. Chance alignment probabilities are calculated to evaluate the physical nature of each system. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey are included for all objects. We identify potential unseen companions using a combination of the Renormalised Unit Weight Error, Image Parameter Determination statistics, Non-Single Star solutions, and photometric blending as provided by Gaia, identifying hierarchical Ultracool triple systems. Our catalogue includes 17 White Dwarf - Ultracool Dwarf systems, whose ages are determined using cooling models. We also use the Gaia FLAME results and the BANYAN $\Sigma$ procedures to age 40 and 34 systems respectively, and derive mass estimates from evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Solar active region evolution and imminent flaring activity through a color-coded visualization of photospheric vector magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of magnetic flux, its transition to complex configurations, and the pre-eruptive state of active regions are probed using photospheric magnetograms. We aim to pinpoint different evolutionary stages in active regions, explore their differences and produce parameters that could advance flare prediction, using color-coded maps of the photospheric magnetic field. The three components of the photospheric magnetic field vector are combined in color-coded magnetograms (COCOMAGs). From these, the areas occupied by different colors are extracted, creating appropriate time series (color curves). The COCOMAGs and color curves are used as proxies of the active region evolution and complexity. The COCOMAGs morphology reflects typical features of active regions, such as sunspots, plages, and sheared polarity inversion lines. The color curves represent the area occupied by photospheric magnetic field of different orientation and contain information relevant to the evolutionary stages of active regions. During emergence, most of the area is dominated by horizontal or highly inclined magnetic field, which gradually gives its place to more vertical magnetic field. In complex regions, large parts are covered by highly inclined magnetic fields, appearing as abrupt color changes. Active region decay is signified by a domination of vertical magnetic field, indicating a gradual relaxation of the magnetic field configuration. The color curves exhibit varying degree of correlation with active region complexity. The red and magenta color curves, which represent strong, purely horizontal magnetic field, are good indicators of future flaring. Color-coded magnetograms facilitate a comprehensive view of the evolution of active regions and their complexity. They offer a framework for the treatment of complex observations and can be used in pattern recognition, feature extraction and flare prediction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optical spectroscopy and photometry of the type I X-ray bursting system UW CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type 1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2 years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average $e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to transient absorption.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bursty Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy star formation histories are theoretically expected to be bursty, potentially leaving distinct imprints on their chemical evolution. We propose that episodic starbursts with quiescent periods longer than $\sim$100 Myr should lead to discontinuous tracks in a dwarf galaxy's [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance plane, with metallicity gaps as large as 0.3-0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = -2. This occurs due to continued Fe production by Type Ia supernovae during quiescent periods. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixture models can statistically distinguish discontinuous and continuous tracks based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Applying this method to APOGEE observations of the Sculptor dSph galaxy suggests an episodic star formation history with $\sim$300 Myr quiescent periods. While current dwarf galaxy datasets are limited by small spectroscopic sample sizes, future surveys and extremely large telescopes will enable determining large numbers of precise chemical abundances, opening up the investigation of very short timescales in early dwarf galaxy formation. This unprecedentedly high time resolution of dwarf galaxy formation in the early Universe has important implications for understanding both reionization in the early Universe and the episodic star formation cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Identification and distance measurement of dust clouds at high latitude by a clustering hierarchical algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of dust clouds at high Galactic latitude based on the Planck 857 GHz dust emission data. Using a clustering hierarchical algorithm, 315 dust cloud at high Galactic latitudes are identified. Additionally, using the optical and ultraviolet extinction of 4 million and 1 million stars, respectively, provided by Sun et al., we derive the distances and physical properties for 190 high Galactic latitude dust clouds and the ultraviolet excess ratios for 165 of them. Through the study of color excess ratios, this work confirms that molecular clouds with large Galactic distances and low extinction likely have a higher proportion of small-sized dust grains. In addition, clouds with well-defined distances in the catalog are used to trace the local bubble, showing good consistency with the boundary of the local bubble from the literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Constrained Ensemble Image Segmentation of Coronal Holes in Chromospheric Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal Holes (CHs) are large-scale, low-density regions in the solar atmosphere which may expel high-speed solar wind streams that incite hazardous, geomagnetic storms. Coronal and solar wind models can predict these high-speed streams and the performance of the coronal model can be validated against segmented CH boundaries. We present a novel method named Sub-Transition Region Identification of Ensemble Coronal Holes (STRIDE-CH) to address prominent challenges in segmenting CHs with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imagery. Ground-based, chromospheric He I 10830 {\AA} line imagery and underlying Fe I photospheric magnetograms are revisited to disambiguate CHs from filaments and quiet Sun, overcome obscuration by coronal loops, and complement established methods in the community which use space-borne, coronal EUV observations. Classical computer vision techniques are applied to constrain the radiative and magnetic properties of detected CHs, produce an ensemble of boundaries, and compile these boundaries in a confidence map that quantifies the likelihood of CH presence throughout the solar disk. This method is science-enabling towards future studies of CH formation and variability from a mid-atmospheric perspective.</description>

      <title>Why are (almost) all the protostellar outflows aligned in Serpens Main?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep 1.4-4.8 um JWST-NIRCam imaging of the Serpens Main star-forming region and identify 20 candidate protostellar outflows, most with bipolar structure and identified driving sources. The outflow position angles (PAs) are strongly correlated, and aligned within +/- 24 degrees of the major axis of the Serpens filament. These orientations are further aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the two disk shadows in this region. We estimate that the probability of this number of young stars being co-aligned if sampled from a uniform PA distribution is 10^-4. This in turn suggests that the aligned protostars, which seem to be at similar evolutionary stages based on their outflow dynamics, formed at similar times with a similar spin inherited from a local cloud filament. Further, there is tentative evidence for a systematic change in average position angle between the north-western and south-eastern cluster, as well as increased scatter in the PAs of the south-eastern protostars. SOFIA-HAWC+ archival dust polarization observations of Serpens Main at 154 and 214 um are perpendicular to the dominant jet orientation in NW region in particular. We measure and locate shock knots and edges for all of the outflows and provide an identifying catalog. We suggest that Serpens main is a cluster that formed from an isolated filament, and due to its youth retains its primordial outflow alignment.</description>

      <title>Planet migration in massive circumbinary discs</title>

Abstract: Most stars are in multiple systems, with the majority of those being binaries. A large number of planets have been confirmed in binary stars and therefore it is important to understand their formation and dynamical evolution. We perform simulations to investigate the migration of wide-orbit giant planets (semi-major axis 100 AU) in massive circumbinary discs (mass 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that are marginally gravitationally unstable, using the three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic code SEREN. We vary the binary parameters to explore their effect on planet migration. We find that a planet in a massive circumbinary disc initially undergoes a period of rapid inward migration before switching to a slow outward migration, as it does in a circumstellar disc. However, the presence of the binary enhances planet migration and mass growth. We find that a high binary mass ratio (binary with equal mass stars) results in more enhanced outward planet migration. Additionally, larger binary separation and/or higher binary eccentricity results to a faster outward planet migration and stronger planet growth. We conclude that wide-orbit giant planets attain wider final orbits due to migration around binary stars than around single stars.</description>

      <title>Development of a data overflow protection system for Super-Kamiokande to maximize data from nearby supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from very nearby supernovae, such as Betelgeuse, are expected to generate more than ten million events over 10\,s in Super-Kamokande (SK). At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations. Additionally, using simulation data we find that supernovae closer than 800~pc will trigger Veto module resulting in a prescaling of the observed neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Neglected Silicon Dioxide Polymorphs as Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct mid-infrared signatures of silicate clouds in substellar atmospheres were first detected in Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs, although their existence was previously inferred from near-infrared spectra. With JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instrument, we can now more deeply probe silicate features from 8 to 10 microns, exploring specific particle composition, size, and structure. Recent characterization efforts have led to the identification in particular of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO$_2$) cloud features in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Previous modeling, motivated by chemical equilibrium, has primarily focused on magnesium silicates (forsterite, enstatite), crystalline quartz, and amorphous silica to match observations. Here, we explore the previously neglected possibility that other crystalline structures of silica, i.e. polymorphs, may be more likely to form at the pressure and temperature conditions of substellar upper atmospheres. We evaluate JWST's diagnostic potential for these polymorphs and find that existing published transmission data are only able to conclusively distinguish tridymite, but future higher signal-to-noise transmission observations, directly imaged planet observations, and brown dwarf observations may be able to disentangle all four of the silica polymorphs. We ultimately propose that accounting for the distinct opacities arising from the possible crystalline structure of cloud materials may act as a powerful, observable diagnostic tracer of atmospheric conditions, where particle crystallinity records the history of the atmospheric regions through which clouds formed and evolved. Finally, we highlight that high fidelity, accurate laboratory measurements of silica polymorphs are critically needed to draw meaningful conclusions about the identities and structures of clouds in substellar atmospheres.</description>
