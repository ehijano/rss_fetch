      <title>Shape Derivatives of the Eigenvalues of the De Rham Complex for Lipschitz Deformations and Variable Coefficients: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second part of our series of papers, we develop an abstract framework suitable for de Rham complexes that depend on a parameter belonging to an arbitrary Banach space. Our primary focus is on spectral perturbation problems and the differentiability of eigenvalues with respect to perturbations of the involved parameters.
  As a byproduct, we provide a proof of the celebrated Hellmann-Feynman theorem for both simple and multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces, even when these operators depend on possibly infinite-dimensional parameters. We then apply this abstract machinery to the de Rham complex in three dimensions, considering mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. In particular, we derive Hadamard-type formulas for Maxwell and Helmholtz eigenvalues.
  First, we compute the derivatives under minimal regularity assumptions - specifically, Lipschitz regularity - on both the domain and the perturbation, expressing the results in terms of volume integrals. Second, under more regularity assumptions on the domains, we reformulate these formulas in terms of surface integrals.</description>

      <title>Spectral geometry of the curl operator on smoothly bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of the curl operator on a generic smoothly bounded domain in three-dimensional Euclidean space consists of simple eigenvalues. The main new ingredient in our proof is a formula for the variation of curl eigenvalues under a perturbation of the domain, reminiscent of Hadamard's formula for the variation of Laplace eigenvalues under Dirichlet boundary conditions. As another application of this variational formula, we simplify the derivation of a well-known necessary condition for a domain to minimize the first curl eigenvalue functional among domains of a given volume and derive similar necessary conditions for a domain extremizing higher eigenvalue functionals.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the sum of the reciprocals of eigenvalues of bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, spheres, and closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish lower bounds for the sum of the reciprocals of eigenvalues of the Laplacian. For bounded domains, our result extends the upper bound provided by Bucur and Henrot on the second Neumann eigenvalue and is related to a result by Wang and Xia, which connects to a conjecture of Ashbaugh and Benguria. For spheres and surfaces, we extend known results on the first and second eigenvalues, and strengthen an analogous conjecture involving the conformal volume of Li and Yau.</description>

      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core focus of this series of two articles is the study of the distribution of the length spectrum of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$, sampled randomly with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure. In the first article, we introduced a notion of local topological type $T$, and established the existence of a density function $V_g^T(l)$ describing the distribution of the lengths of all closed geodesics of type $T$ in a genus $g$ hyperbolic surface. We proved that $V_g^T(l)$ admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/g$. We introduced a new class of functions, called Friedman-Ramanujan functions, and related it to the study of the spectral gap $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.
  In this second part, we provide a variety of new tools allowing to compute and estimate the volume functions $V_g^T(l)$. Notably, we construct new sets of coordinates on Teichm\"uller spaces, distinct from Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, in which the Weil-Petersson volume has a simple form. These coordinates are tailored to the geodesics we study, and we can therefore prove nice formulae for their lengths. We use these new ideas, together with a notion of pseudo-convolutions, to prove that the coefficients of the expansion of $V_g^T(l)$ in powers of $1/g$ are Friedman-Ramanujan functions, for any local topological type $T$. We then exploit this result to prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, $\lambda_1 \geq \frac14 - \epsilon$ with probability going to one as $g \rightarrow + \infty$, or, in other words, typical hyperbolic surfaces have an asymptotically optimal spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.
  In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits. In: Active Particles, Volume 2, 2019) in the microscopic setting.</description>

      <title>Improved $L^\infty$ bounds for eigenfunctions under random perturbations in negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>
