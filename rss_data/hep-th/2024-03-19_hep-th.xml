      <title>Surface growth approach for bulk reconstruction in AdS/BCFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the surface growth scheme in AdS spacetime with a boundary in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Modularity of Schur index, modular differential equations, and high-temperature asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analytically explore the modularity of the flavored Schur index of 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs. We focus on the $A_1$ theories of class-$\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group. We work out the modular orbit of the flavored index and defect index, compute the dimension of the space spanned by the orbit, and provide complete basis for computing modular transformation matrices. The dimension obtained from the flavored analysis predicts the minimal order of the unflavored modular differential equation satisfied by the unflavored Schur index. With the help of modularity, we also study analytically the high-temperature asymptotics of the Schur index. In the high-temperature limit $\tau \to +i0$, we identified the (defect) Schur index of the genus-zero $A_1$ theories of class-$\mathcal{S}$ with the $S^3$-partition function of the $SU(2) \times U(1)^n$ star-shape quiver (with Wilson line insertion). In the identification, we observe an interesting relation between the linear-independence of defect indices and the convergence of the Wilson line partition functions.</description>

      <title>On categorification of Stokes coefficients in Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite-dimensional oscillatory integral which provides a "finite-dimensional model" for analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory on closed 3-manifolds that are described by plumbing trees. This model allows an efficient description of Stokes phenomenon for perturbative expansions in Chern-Simons theory around classical solutions - $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connections. Moreover, the Stokes coefficients can be categorified, i.e. promoted to graded vector spaces, in terms of this finite-dimensional model. At least naively, the categorification gives BPS spectrum of 5d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the 3-manifold times a line with appropriate boundary conditions. We also comment on necessity of taking into account "flat connections at infinity" to capture Stokes phenomenon for certain 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Weyl Gravity in Probing Quantum Corrections to AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing leading higher curvature contributions to thermodynamic quantities of AdS black hole is drastically simplified once the higher curvature terms are expressed in terms of powers of Weyl tensor by applying proper field redefinitions, avoiding the usual complications caused by higher derivative Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term or surface counterterms. We establish the method by computing the Euclidean action of general rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional quadratic curvature theories with or without supersymmetry and verifying the results numerically. Our result is the state of the art for charged rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity including corrections from all three supersymmetric curvature squared terms. Our approach facilitates precision tests in the AdS/CFT correspondence and should be applicable in diverse dimensions.</description>

      <title>Soft Scalars in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a soft theorem for a massless scalar in an effective field theory with generic field content using the geometry of field space. This result extends the geometric soft theorem for scalar effective field theories by allowing the massless scalar to couple to other scalars, fermions, and gauge bosons. The soft theorem keeps its geometric form, but where the field-space geometry now involves the full field content of the theory. As a bonus, we also present novel double soft theorems with fermions, which mimic the geometric structure of the double soft theorem for scalars.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for $p=2$ like glassy matrices in the planar approximation: II. Ward identities method in the deep IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, as a continuation of our previous investigation [arXiv:2403.07577] aims to study the glassy random matrices with quenched Wigner disorder. In this previous work, we have constructed a renormalization group based on the effective deterministic kinetic spectrum emerging from large $N$ limit, and we extended approximate solutions using standard vertex expansion, at the leading order of the derivative expansion. Now in the following work, by introducing the non-trivial Ward identities which come from the $(\mathcal{U}(N))^{\times 2}$ symmetry broken of the effective kinetic action, we provide in the deep IR the explicit solution of the functional renormalization group for a model with quartic coupling by solving the Hierarchy to all orders in the local sector, which in particular imply the vanishing of the anomalous dimension. The numerical investigations confirm the first-order phase transition discovered in the vertex expansion framework, both in the active and passive schemes. Finally, we extend the discussion to hermitian matrices.</description>

      <title>Orbifold Indices in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric indices for four-dimensional gauge theories defined on $\mathscr O \times S^1$, where $\mathscr O $ is a circle bundle over the weighted complex projective line informally known as spindle. Trivial fibrations yield a four-dimensional version of the spindle index, which we obtain by applying localization to partition functions of theories on the direct product of a spindle and a two-dimensional torus. Conversely, non-trivial fibrations lead to the branched lens index, which we compute by localizing theories on the direct product of a circle and a branched covering of the lens space, possibly endowed with conical singularities. The branched lens index encompasses the maximally refined four-dimensional lens index as a special case.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics, anomaly inflow and bosonic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler hydrodynamics of perfect fluids can be viewed as an effective bosonic field theory. In cases when the underlying microscopic system involves Dirac fermions, the quantum anomalies should be properly described. In 1+1 dimensions the action formulation of hydrodynamics at zero temperature is reconsidered and shown to be equal to standard field-theory bosonization. Furthermore, it can be derived from a topological gauge theory in one extra dimension, which identifies the fluid variables through the anomaly inflow relations. Extending this framework to 3+1 dimensions yields an effective field theory/hydrodynamics model, capable of elucidating the mixed axial-vector and axial-gravitational anomalies of Dirac fermions. This formulation provides a platform for bosonization in higher dimensions. Moreover, the connection with 4+1 dimensional topological theories suggests some generalizations of fluid dynamics involving additional degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse scattering problem is applied to 2-dimensional partial differential equations called soliton equations such as the KdV equation and so on. It is also used to integrate the Einstein equations with axial symmetry. These inverse scattering problems look different. We show that they can be understood in a unified way. As an application to the Einstein equation, we find solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with magnetic charge.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of signed eigenvalue/vector distributions of random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in the large $N$ limit have been obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.</description>

      <title>Freezing and BPS jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel BPS jumping phenomenon of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories whose brane configuration is equipped with an O$7$-plane. The study of the relation between O$7{}^+$-plane and O$7{}^-$-plane reveals that such BPS jumps take place when the Higgsing is triggered near the O7-plane upon a particular parameter tuning of the theories. We propose two types of gauge theories whose BPS spectra jump. One is the SU($2N+8$) gauge theory with a symmetric hypermultiplet converted to the SU($2N$) gauge theory with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet. The other is pure SO($2N+8$) gauge theory jumping to pure Sp($N$) gauge theory. We explicitly confirm our proposal through the (un)refined instanton partition functions. Furthermore, we discuss feasible generalizations involving an O$p$-plane for supersymmetric gauge theories of eight supercharges in four and three dimensions ($p=6, 5$ respectively).</description>

      <title>An example of the convergence of hydrodynamics in strong external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence is used to provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the linearized gradient expansion of the hydrodynamic description of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory minimally coupled to $U(1)$ gauge theory subjected to strong magnetic fields. The results of this work demonstrate that the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes continue to converge for magnetic field strengths far beyond those values for which a hydrodynamic description is expected. For magnetic field strengths much larger then the temperature scale the bulk dual interpolates between AdS$_{4+1}$ and $\text{BTZ}_{2+1}\times \mathbb{R}^2$ and may be regarded as a renormalization group flow of the $3+1$ CFT dimensional theory to a $1+1$ CFT. In this regime, we clarify past literature on the QNM spectrum of bulk scalar fields by introducing a new way to classify the behavior of QNM collisions in the complex frequency and momentum plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Fermi gas formalism for the partition function of supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories with affine $D$-type quiver diagrams with non-uniform ranks of the gauge groups and Fayet-Illiopoulos parameters by two different approaches: the open string formalism and the closed string formalism. In the closed string formalism approach, we find a novel connection between the partition function of this theory and the partition function of a four-nodes circular quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. We also studied a symmetry of a density matrix appeared in the closed string formalism. We further calculate the exact values of the partition function for finite $N$, with which we identified the exponent of the leading non-perturbative effect in $1/N$ corresponding to the worldsheet instantons in the circular quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

      <title>Hidden Zeros in Scaffolded General Relativity and Exceptional Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently discovered by Arkani-Hamed et al that the colour-ordered scattering amplitudes of Tr$(\Phi^3)$, the NLSM and scaffolded YM vanish at specific loci. We build on this observation and demonstrate that, beyond colour ordering, scattering amplitudes can display multiple instances of these hidden zeros. A first example are the flavour-ordered amplitudes of scaffolded General Relativity, corresponding to graviton exchange. The other two cases are multi-flavour DBI and the special Galileon. These are the natural generalisations of the NLSM with multiple instances of Adler's zero. The zero loci naturally define factorisation limits; in all three cases these include a metric-coupled cubic scalar theory. We comment on the general picture of hidden zeros and the relation to the double copy.</description>

      <title>Subvolume method for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: topological charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the previously-developed sub-volume method to study the $\theta$-dependence of the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. We calculate the first two coefficients, the topological susceptibility $\chi$ and the fourth cumulant $b_2$, in the $\theta$-expansion of the free energy density around the critical temperature for the confinement-deconfinement transition. Lattice calculations are performed with three different spatial sizes $24^3,32^3,48^3$ to monitor finite size effects, while the temporal size is fixed to be $8$. The sub-volume method allows us to determine the values of $b_2$ much more accurately than the standard full-volume method, and we have successfully measured the temperature dependence of $b_2$ around the critical temperature. Our numerical results suggest that the $\theta$-dependence of the free energy density changes approximately from $4\chi(1-\cos(\theta/2))$ to $\chi(1-\cos\theta)$ near $\theta=0$ as the temperature increases.</description>

Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG).</description>

      <title>Holographic Energy Correlators for Confining Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holographic calculation of energy correlators in a simple model of confinement based on a warped extra dimension with an IR brane. For small distances we reproduce the constant correlators of a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, while for large distances the effects of confinement dominate and the correlators decay exponentially. We find exact shockwave solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of the IR brane, hence avoiding the need for a perturbative expansion in terms of Witten diagrams. While some of the expected qualitative features of energy correlators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are reproduced, our crude model of confinement does not capture the effects of asymptotic freedom nor exhibit jetty behavior. We expect that our method can also be applied to more realistic models of confinement incorporating asymptotic freedom, which should fix some of the deviations from QCD.</description>

      <title>Are accelerated detectors sensitive to Planck scale changes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the foremost concern in the analysis of quantum gravity is whether the locations of classical horizons are stable under a full quantum analysis. In principle, any classical description, when interpolated to the microscopic level, can become prone to fluctuations. The curious question in that case is if there indeed are such fluctuations at the Planck scale, do they have any significance for physics taking place at scales much away from the Planck scale? In this work, we try to attempt the question of small scales and address whether there are definitive signatures of Planck scale shifts in the horizon structure. In a recent work (arXiv:2107.03406), it was suggested that in a nested sequence of Rindler causal wedges, the vacua of preceding Rindler frames appear thermally populated to a shifted Rindler frame. The Bogoliubov analysis used relies on the global notion of the quantum field theory and might be unable to see the local character of such horizon shifts. We investigate this system by means of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and see if this local probe of the quantum field theory is sensitive enough to the shift parameters to reveal any microscopic effects. For the case of infinite-time response, we recover the thermal spectrum, thus reaffirming that the infinite-time response probes the global properties of the field. On the other hand, the finite-time response turns out to be sensitive to the shift parameter in a peculiar way that any detector with energy gap $\Omega c/a \sim 1$ and is operational for time scale $T a/c \sim 1$ has a measurably different response for a macroscopic and microscopic shift of the horizon, giving us direct probe to the tiniest separation between the causal domains of such Rindler wedges. Thus, this study provides an operational method to identify Planck scale effects which can be generalized to various other interesting gravitational settings.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of Rotating compact objects in Plasma space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of shadows cast by the Kerr black hole in the presence of plasma and compared them to those of a rotating wormhole in a uniform plasma space-time for an observer at infinity. Interestingly, for the same uniform plasma density, the apparent shadow size of the rotating wormhole is always greater than that of the Kerr black hole. To further distinguish the two compact objects we studied the deflection angle and did a comparative study in the presence of the uniform and non-uniform plasma profiles. The goal of this whole exercise is to deepen our understanding of the observational phenomena of these astrophysical objects. The analysis reveals the importance of specific plasma distribution profiles, the impact of plasma on the shadow diameter, and the behavior of deflection angles in different plasma scenarios. We have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters by considering observational data and employing analytical formulations, we have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters. Our work therefore provides valuable insights into the behavior of light rays near compact objects in plasma space-time.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Thermodynamic Stability in an Entropy-driven Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion that the mathematics of gravity can be reproduced from a statistical requirement of maximal entropy, we study the consequence of introducing an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action. For a spatially homogeneous cosmological system driven by this entropic source and enveloped by a time evolving apparent horizon, we formulate a modified version of the second law of thermodynamics. An explicit differential equation governing the internal entropy profile is found. Using a Hessian matrix analysis of the internal entropy we check the thermodynamic stability for a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, a unified cosmic expanson and a non-singular ekpyrotic bounce. We find the mathematical condition for a second order phase transition during these evolutions from the divergence of specific heat at constant volume. The condition is purely kinematic and quadratic in nature, relating the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter that chalks out an interesting curve on the parameter space. This condition is valid even without the entropic source term and may be a general property of any phase transition.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Descriptions of Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [arXiv:2307.13489 [gr-qc]], we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we therefore define a more general framework, which we call an "effective metric description" (EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow to express one EMD in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We compute all refined sheaf counting invariants -- Vafa-Witten, reduced DT, stable pairs and Gopakumar-Vafa -- for all classes on local $K3$ surfaces. Along the way we develop rank 0 Vafa-Witten theory on $K3$ surfaces.
  An important feature of the calculation is that the ``instanton contribution" -- of sheaves supported scheme theoretically on $S$ -- to any of the invariants depends only on the square of the class, not its divisibility.</description>

Abstract: A critical discussion on the $H_0$ Hubble constant tension is presented by considering both early and late-type observations. From recent precise measurements, discrepancies emerge when comparing results for some cosmological quantities obtained at different redshifts. We highlight the most relevant measurements of $H_0$ and propose potential ideas to solve its tension. These solutions concern the exploration of new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model or the evaluation of $H_0$ by other methods. In particular, we focus on the role of the look-back time.</description>

      <title>The Inflationary Butterfly Effect: Non-Perturbative Dynamics From Small-Scale Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>General properties of the electric Penrose process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Penrose process with the charged particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m background. Let parent particle 0 decay to particles 1 and 2. With the assumption that all three particles move in the same plane, the exact formulas for characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in terms of those of particle 0 are derived. We concentrate on scenarios in which particle 1 and 2 are ejected along the trajectory of particle 0. It is shown that such scenarios correspond to the extrema of energies $E_{1}$ or $E_{2}$ of daughter particles with respect to the angular momentum $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ of one of them. We derive bounds on the values of angular momenta $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. We give classification of these scenarios and discuss their properties including decay in the near-horizon region. The results are reformulated in terms of velocities of daughter particles in the center of mass frame. The approach is applicable also to collisional Penrose process, in which a combination of particles 1 and 2 is considered as one effective particle. If the mass of particle 0 $m_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the situation corresponds to the Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect, the results agree with the ones known in literature before. In addition, we consider special cases when decay occurs in the turning point for one or all three particles.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to $N$-wave equations with constant boundary conditions related to symplectic Lie algebras. We study the spectral properties of a class of Lax operators $L$, whose potentials $Q(x,t)$ tend to constants $Q_\pm$ for $x\to \pm \infty$. For special choices of $Q_\pm$ we outline the spectral properties of $L$, the direct scattering transform and construct its fundamental analytic solutions. We generalise Wronskian relations for the case of CBC -- this allows us to analyse the mapping between the scattering data and the $x$-derivative of the potential $Q_x$. Next, using the Wronskian relations we derive the dispersion laws for the $N$-wave hierarchy and describe the NLEE related to the given Lax operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress has revealed a number of constraints that cosmological correlators and the closely related field-theoretic wavefunction must obey as a consequence of unitarity, locality, causality and the choice of initial state. When combined with symmetries, namely homogeneity, isotropy and scale invariance, these constraints enable one to compute large classes of simple observables, an approach known as (boostless) cosmological bootstrap. Here we show that it is possible to relax the restriction of scale invariance, if one retains a discrete scaling subgroup. We find an infinite class of solutions to the weaker bootstrap constraints and show that they reproduce and extend resonant non-Gaussianity, which arises in well-motivated models such as axion monodromy inflation. We find no evidence of the new non-Gaussian shapes in the Planck data. Intriguingly, our results can be re-interpreted as a deformation of the scale-invariant case to include a complex order of the total energy pole, or more evocatively interactions with a complex number of derivatives. We also discuss for the first time IR-divergent resonant contributions and highlight an inconsequential inconsistency in the previous literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we set up the numerical S-matrix bootstrap by using the crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) to write down Roy equations for the partial waves. As a motivation behind examining the local version of the CSDR, we derive a new, crossing symmetric, 3-channels-plus-contact-terms representation of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in string theory that converges everywhere except at the poles. We then focus on gapped theories and give novel analytic and semi-analytic derivations of several bounds on low-energy data. We examine the high-energy behaviour of the experimentally measurable rho-parameter, introduced by Khuri and Kinoshita and defined as the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the amplitude in the forward limit. Contrary to expectations, we find numerical evidence that there could be multiple changes in the sign of this ratio before it asymptotes at high energies. We compare our approach with other existing numerical methods and find agreement, with improvement in convergence.</description>

Abstract: We ask whether Krylov complexity is mutually compatible with the circuit and Nielsen definitions of complexity. We show that the Krylov complexities between three states fail to satisfy the triangle inequality and so cannot be a measure of distance: there is no possible metric for which Krylov complexity is the length of the shortest path to the target state or operator. We show this explicitly in the simplest example, a single qubit, and in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gravity, spacelike separated regions can be dependent on each other due to the constraint equations. In this paper, we give a natural definition of subsystem independence and gravitational dressing of perturbations in classical gravity. We find that extremal surfaces, non-perturbative lumps of matter, and generic trapped surfaces are structures that enable dressing and subregion independence. This leads to a simple intuitive picture for why extremal surfaces tend to separate independent subsystems. The underlying reason is that localized perturbations on one side of an extremal surface contribute negatively to the mass on the other side, making the gravitational constraints behave as if there exist both negative and positive charges. Our results support the consistency of islands in massless gravity, shed light on the Python's lunch, and provide hints on the nature of the split property in perturbatively quantized general relativity. We also prove a theorem bounding the area of certain surfaces in spherically symmetric asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes from above and below in terms of the horizon areas of de Sitter and Nariai. This theorem implies that it is impossible to deform a single static patch without also deforming the opposite patch, provided we assume spherical symmetry and an energy condition.</description>

Abstract: A ``large'' AdS black hole can attain equilibrium with its own Hawking radiation, and in that condition it is thought to be dual to a strongly coupled field theory, also at equilibrium. But the interior of the black hole is by no means static: the geometry of spatial sections lying inside the event horizon evolves at some rate. This prompts the obvious question: can this rate possibly have a holographic dual? We present circumstantial evidence that such a dual does exist. We do this by making concrete proposals for two objects: first, a rough measure (already suggested in the literature) of the rate at which the unitary evolution of the state vector describing equilibrated strongly coupled matter evolves; and, second, a rough measure of the rate at which the interior (just under the horizon) evolves (in the case of the AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole). We then study how these two very different objects change as two physical parameters describing the exterior of the bulk black hole (the specific angular momentum and the temperature) are varied. We find that they change in remarkably similar ways, as holographic duals should.</description>

      <title>Analytic Formulae for Inflationary Correlators with Dynamical Mass</title>

Abstract: Massive fields can imprint unique oscillatory features on primordial correlation functions or inflationary correlators, which is dubbed the cosmological collider signal. In this work, we analytically investigate the effects of a time-dependent mass of a scalar field on inflationary correlators, extending previous numerical studies and implementing techniques developed in the cosmological bootstrap program. The time-dependent mass is in general induced by couplings to the slow-roll inflaton background, with particularly significant effects in the case of non-derivative couplings. By linearly approximating the time dependence, the mode function of the massive scalar is computed analytically, on which we derive analytic formulae for two-, three-, and four-point correlators with the tree-level exchange of the massive scalar. The obtained formulae are utilized to discuss the phenomenological impacts on the power spectrum and bispectrum, and it is found that the scaling behavior of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration, i.e., the cosmological collider signal, is modified from a time-dependent Boltzmann suppression. By investigating the scaling behavior in detail, we are in principle able to determine the non-derivative couplings between the inflaton and the massive particle.</description>

Abstract: Celestial holography is a new way to understand flat-space amplitudes. Self-dual theories, due to their nice properties, are good subjects to study celestial holography. In this paper, we developed a new formula to calculate the celestial color-ordered self-dual Yang-Mills amplitudes based on celestial Berends-Giele currents, which makes the leading OPE limit manifest. In addition, we explore some higher-order terms of OPE in the celestial self-dual Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS Solitons and the interconnection of different vacua of ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find AdS soliton solutions in 5-dimensional gauged supergravity, obtained from the $S^5$ compactification of type IIB, with a dilaton saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The solutions depend on the value of the periodicity of an $S^1$ cycle and the boundary values for two $U(1)$ gauge fields, and give a scalar VEV in the dual field theory. At certain values of the gauge sources we have supersymmetric solutions, corresponding to supersymmetric flows, which are a deformation of the Coulomb Branch flow in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. The solutions parameterize quantum phase transitions between a discrete spectrum phase, a continuous above a mass gap phase, and a continuous without a mass gap phase, in 2+1 dimensions. We analyze the phase diagram in terms of the QFT sources and we find that for every value for them, there are always two branches of supergravity solutions. We find that these two branches of solitons correspond to two possible vacua existing in the dual QFT when fermions are anti-periodic on an $S^1$. We describe the interconnection of these states in the QFT at strong 't Hooft coupling in the large $N$ limit. In 10 dimensions, our solutions are related to deformations of D3-brane distributions.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate-space structure function $f_a(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin-representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions at various powers are naturally generated in their Borel representations. At leading power (LP), the collinear factorization formula is explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. At NLP, there are three series of non-perturbative functions and the related hard functions. At higher powers, explicit forms for all the contributions are also obtained. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified to all powers. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in coordinate space and momentum-fraction spaces ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with ``zero-mode-type'' subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. We also investigate the threshold expansion of the structure function and its relation to the twist expansion.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator as a detector of baryonic phase structure in holographic QCD with a theta angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) of Skyrmion as baryon in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically dual to QCD with an non-zero theta angle. The baryon state is identified to the excitation of the Skyrmion which is described by a quantum mechanical system in holography. By employing the definition of OTOC in quantum mechanics, we derive the formulas and demonstrate explicitly the numerical calculations of the OTOC. Our calculation illustrates the quantum OTOC with imaginary Lyapunov coefficient indicates the possibly metastable baryonic status in the presence of the theta angle while the classical OTOC can not, thus it reveals the theta-dependent features of QCD are dominated basically by its quantum properties. Furthermore, the OTOC also implies the baryonic phase becomes really chaotic with real Lyapunov exponent if the theta angle increases sufficiently which agrees with the unstable baryon spectrum presented in this model. In this sense, we believe the OTOC may be treated as a tool to detect the baryonic phase structure of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equilibrium states of a $N\times N$ stochastic complex random matrix $M$, whose entries evolve in time accordingly with a Langevin equation including both Gaussian white noises and a linear disorder, materialized by the Wigner random matrices. In large $N$-limit, the disorders behave as effective kinetics, and we examine a coarse-graining over the Wigner spectrum accordingly with two different schemes that we call respectively active and passive. We then investigate explicit solutions of the nonperturbative renormalization group using vertex and derivative expansion, a simple way to deal with the nonlocal nature of the effective field theory at large $N$. Our main statement is the existence of well-behaved fixed point solutions and at least some evidence about a discontinuous (first order) phase transition between a condensed and a dilute phase. We finally interpret the resulting phase space regarding the out-of-equilibrium process related to the dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Canonical and Non-canonical Inflation in the light of the recent BICEP/Keck results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss implications of the latest BICEP/Keck data release for inflationary models, with particular emphasis on scalar fields with non-canonical Lagrangians of the type ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$. The observational upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r \leq 0.036$, implies that the whole family of monomial power law potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$ are now ruled out in the canonical framework at $95\%$ confidence, which includes the simplest classic inflationary potentials such as $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$ and $\lambda \phi^4$. Instead, current observations strongly favour asymptotically flat plateau potentials. However, working in the non-canonical framework, we demonstrate that monomial potentials, as well as the Higgs potential with its Standard Model self-coupling, can easily be accommodated by current CMB data. We find striking similarities between the $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$ flow lines of monomial potentials in the non-canonical framework and the T-model $\alpha$-attractors in the canonical framework. Significantly, $V(\phi)$ can originate from Planck scale initial values $V(\phi) \simeq m_p^4$ in non-canonical models while in plateau-like canonical inflation the initial value of the potential is strongly suppressed $V_{\rm plat}(\phi) \leq 10^{-10} m_p^4$. This has bearing on the issue of initial conditions for inflation and allows for the equipartition of the kinetic and potential terms in non-canonical models.</description>

      <title>Topological Defects in Floquet Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet circuit describing the driven Ising chain with topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. The Floquet unitary evolution operator commutes with such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the return amplitudes in the presence of "space-like" defects stretching around the system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary evolution in the presence of "time-like" defects that implement anti-periodic and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single time step for a system of a few sites, for all of the above defect configurations.</description>

      <title>The gauge symmetry - unbroken and broken - in the QCD ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is to report on convincing progress made in the investigation of the one of the long-standing conceptual problems in QCD, namely whether the gauge symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian and its ground state coincide or not? For this purpose, we use only the tensor algebra derivation rigorous rules in dealing with the corresponding skeleton loop integrals, contributing into the full gluon self-energy. It has been exactly (i.e., without making any kind of the simplifications) proven that in the QCD ground state may exist the two principally different types of the gluon field configurations. One of them maintains the QCD Lagrangian's gauge symmetry, but another one does not.The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared. The exact proof has been given that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by any means. The gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian forbids such term, but the perturbative renormalizability of the theory will not be affected. This allows to present the new significant insights into the gauge and dynamical structures of the true QCD ground state, and sheds light on a mass squared dynamical generation in it.</description>

Abstract: The injection of early dark energy (EDE) before the recombination, a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, will not only shift the scalar spectral index $n_s$ towards $n_s=1$, but also be likely to tighten the current upper limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In this work, with the latest CMB datasets (Planck PR4, ACT, SPT and BICEP/Keck), as well as BAO and SN, we confirm this result, and discuss its implication on inflation. We also show that if we happen to live with EDE, how the different inflation models currently allowed would be distinguished by planned CMB observations, such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Linear Holographic Hard Wall Models for Glueballs and the Pomeron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose improved holographic hard wall (HW) models by the inclusion of anomalous dimensions in the dual operators that describe glueballs inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions come from well known semi-classical gauge/string duality analysis showing a dependence with the logarithm of spin $S$ of the boundary states. We show that these logarithm anomalous dimensions of the high spin operators combined with the usual HW model allow us to match the pomeron trajectory and give glueball masses which are better than that of the original HW and soft wall (SW) models in comparison with lattice data. We also build up other anomalous HW (AHW) models considering that the logarithm anomalous dimensions can be approximated by a truncated series of odd powers of the difference $\sqrt{S}-1/\sqrt{S}$. These models also fit the pomeron trajectory and produce good glueball masses. Then, we consider an anomalous dimension which is proportional to $\sqrt{S}$, providing reasonable results. Finally, we propose an asymptotic linear AHW model which effective dimensions for high spins operators are of the form $\Delta=a\sqrt{S}+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants to be fixed by comparison with the soft pomeron trajectory. In this last model, the Regge trajectory is asymptotically linear even for very high spins ($J\sim 100$) matching the soft pomeron trajectory accurately and generates glueball masses with deviations with respect to the lattice data better than the original HW and SW models.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future colliders aim to provide highly precise experimental measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson. In order to benefit from these precision machines, theoretical errors in the Higgs sector observables have to match at least the experimental uncertainties. The theoretical uncertainties in the Higgs sector observables can be reduced by including missing higher-order terms in their perturbative calculations. In this direction, we compute the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ to the Higgs decay into four charged leptons by considering the golden decay channel, $ H \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$. Due to color conservation, these corrections receive contributions only from the two-loop virtual diagrams. In the complex mass scheme, we find that the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to the partial decay width, relative to the leading order predictions, are positive and about $0.27\%$ for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. Relative to the next-to-leading order electroweak corrections, the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections are found to be approximately $18\%$ for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. With respect to the leading order, we observe a flat effect of the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pairs with fixed QCD coupling. The $\phi$ distribution, due to the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections, follows a $(1-\cos \phi)$ dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell&lt;518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell&lt;2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scenario where the scalaron of $f({\cal R})$ models is related to the volume modulus of string compactifications leaving only one scalar degree of freedom at low energy. The coefficient of the leading curvature squared contribution to the low energy effective action of gravity determines the mass of the scalaron. We impose that this mass is small enough to allow for the scalaron to drive Starobinski's inflation. After inflation, the renormalisation group evolution of the couplings of the $f({\cal R})$ theory, viewed as a scalar-tensor theory, provides the link with the Infra-Red regime. We consider a scenario where the corrections to the mass of the scalaron are large and reduce it below the electron mass in the Infra-Red, so that the scalaron plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of the Universe. In particular this leads to a connection between the scalaron mass and the measured vacuum energy provided its renormalisation group running at energies higher than the electron mass never drops below the present day value of the dark energy.</description>

      <title>Universal role of curvature in vacuum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight some universal features concerning the role of spacetime curvature in the entanglement induced between quantum probes coupled to a quantum field in a suitable vacuum state. The probes are initially causally disconnected and non-entangled. We explore the parameter space $\{{\omega}, d_0, \boldsymbol{v}_0\}$ spanned by the energy gap $\omega$ of the detectors, and the initial values of separation distance $d_0$ and relative velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$, both covariantly defined in arbitrary curved spacetime. We also obtain numerical results in de Sitter spacetimes and use these to explore strong curvature regime, while also corroborating our perturbative results in arbitrary curved spacetime. Our analysis shows that curvature can induce entanglement features in certain regions of the above parameter space, in a manner which facilitates using entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Isocurvature from Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isocurvature fluctuations, where the relative number density of particle species spatially varies, can be generated from initially adiabatic, or curvature, fluctuations if the various species fall out of or were never in thermal equilibrium. The freezing of the thermal relic dark matter abundance is one such case, but for modes that are still outside the horizon the amplitude is highly suppressed and originates from the small change in the local expansion rate due to the local space curvature produced by the curvature fluctuation. We establish a simple separate-universe method for calculating this generation that applies to both freeze-in and freeze-out models, identify three critical epochs for this process, and give general scaling behaviors for the amplitude in each case: the freezing epoch, the kinetic decoupling epoch and matter-radiation equality. Freeze-out models are typically dominated by spatially modulated annihilation from the latter epochs and can generate much larger isocurvature fluctuations compared with typical freeze-in models, albeit still very small and observationally allowed by cosmic microwave background measurements. We illustrate these results with concrete models where the dark matter interactions are vector or scalar mediated.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a three-dimensional square lattice, whose domain-wall is a two-dimensional sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of DBI scalar field cosmology in coincident $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Holes From Pure Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show via an explicit construction how an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections generically leads to a resolution of the Schwarzschild singularity in any spacetime dimension $D \ge 5$. The theories we consider have two key properties that ensure the results are general and robust: (1) they provide a basis for (vacuum) gravitational effective field theory in five and higher-dimensions, (2) for each value of the mass, they have a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We present several exact solutions of the theories that include the Hayward black hole and metrics similar to the Bardeen and Dymnikova ones. Unlike previous constructions, these regular black holes arise as vacuum solutions, as we include no matter fields whatsoever in our analysis. We show how the black hole thermodynamics can be studied in a completely universal and unambiguous way for all solutions.</description>

      <title>Infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections: Quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of D-dimensional regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies. When comparing the frequencies derived from the metric truncated at several orders of higher curvature corrections with those resulting from the infinite series of terms, we observe a rapid convergence of the frequencies to their limit for the complete regular black hole. This validates the extensive research conducted on specific theories with a finite number of higher curvature corrections, such as the Lovelock theory.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>
