      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <title>Solving $\mathcal N=4$ SYM BCFT matrix models at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many observables in 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions can be described exactly by matrix models via supersymmetric localization. The boundaries typically introduce new degrees of freedom, through a reduction of the gauge symmetry on the boundary or as explicit boundary degrees of freedom, leading to non-trivial matrix models. We derive the saddle points dominating these matrix models at large $N$, expressed in terms of generalized Lambert W-functions. In string theory the BCFTs are realized by D3-branes ending on D5 and NS5 branes. We independently derive the saddle points from the holographic duals with $\rm AdS_4\times S^2\times S^2\times\Sigma$ geometry and provide precision tests of the dualities.</description>

      <title>Quantum dissipative effects for a real scalar field coupled to a time-dependent Dirichlet surface in d+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) for a real scalar field $\varphi$ in $d+1$ dimensions, in the presence of a mirror that imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions and undergoes time-dependent motion or deformation. Using a perturbative approach, we expand in powers of the deviation of the mirror's surface $\Sigma$ from a hyperplane, up to fourth order. General expressions for the probability of pair creation induced by motion are derived, and we analyze the impact of space-time dimensionality as well as of the non-linear effects introduced by the fourth-order terms.</description>

      <title>The physical moduli of heterotic G_2 string compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, an operator was developed for heterotic compactifications on $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}\times G_2$ and $AdS_3 \times G_2$, which preserves $N=1$ $d=3$ supersymmetry and whose kernel is related to the moduli of the compactification. The operator is described in terms of non-physical spurious degrees of freedom, specifically, deformations of a connection on the tangent bundle. In this paper, we eliminate these spurious degrees of freedom by linking deformations of the spin connection to the moduli of the $G_2$ manifold $Y$. This results in an operator $\check D$ that captures the physical moduli space of the $G_2$ heterotic string theory. When $Y=X\times S^1$, with $X$ an $SU(3)$ manifold, we show $\check D$ produces results that align with existing literature. This allows us to propose a $G_2$ moduli space metric. We check that this metric reduces to the $SU(3)$ moduli metric constructed in the literature. We then define an adjoint operator ${\check D}^\dag$. We show the $G_2$ moduli correspond to the intersection of the kernels of $\check D$ and ${\check D}^\dag$. These kernels reduce to the $SU(3)$ F-terms and D-terms respectively on $X\times S^1$. This gives two non-trivial consistency checks of our proposed moduli space metric. Working perturbatively in $\alpha'$, we also demonstrate that the heterotic $G_2$ moduli problem can be characterised in terms of a double extension of ordinary bundles, just like in the $SU(3)$ case.</description>

      <title>M2-M5 giant graviton expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the giant graviton expansions of the Coulomb and Higgs indices for the M2-brane SCFTs to find the closed-form expressions for the indices that encode the spectra of the $1/4$-BPS M5-brane giant gravitons and the $1/3$-BPS orbifold M5-brane giant gravitons. Consequently, we get exact forms of the twisted indices for the 6d $(2,0)$ theories describing a stack of $N$ M5-branes which generalize the unrefined indices. We confirm that they are also beautifully expanded with respect to the indices for the M2-brane giant gravitons which are obtained from the Coulomb and Higgs indices for the M2-brane SCFTs upon the change of variables.</description>

      <title>Entropic Order Parameters for Categorical Symmetries in 2D-CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an information theoretic order parameter able to characterize the presence and breaking of categorical symmetries in (1 + 1)-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Specifically, we compute the quantum relative entropy between the ground states of RCFTs representing the critical point of phase transitions between different symmetry-broken phases of theories with categorical symmetries, and their symmetrized versions. We find that, at leading order in the high temperature limit, this relative entropy only depends on the expectation values of the quantum dimensions of the topological operators implementing the categorical symmetry. This dependence suggests that our proposal can be used to characterize the different broken phases of (1 + 1)-d theories with categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>$L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$ from BRST reductions, associated varieties and nilpotent orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture of Beem and the first author stating that a certain family of physically motivated BRST reductions of beta-gamma systems and free fermions is isomorphic to $L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$, and that its associated variety is isomorphic as a Poisson variety to the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathbb{O}_{\mathrm{min}}(\mathfrak{sl}_n)}$. This shows in particular that $L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$ is quasi-lisse. Combining this with other results in the literature (in particular work of Ballin et al.), this paper provides a concrete and important example of how one can extract two symplectic dual varieties from a rather well-known vertex operator algebra.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion of scalar clouds with spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization of black holes typically occurs through the condensation of a scalar field, with the field evolving from a $U(1)$-symmetric phase into a symmetry-breaking one with lower energy. We show that there exist symmetry-breaking phases which are themselves unstable to the formation of an additional scalar condensate, or `cloud', which is partly accreted into the black hole. By studying the fully nonlinear dynamical evolution of the process, we find that symmetry breaking causes the accretion channels of scalar clouds to be non-degenerate, favoring a dominant channel for evolution. Additionally, the final states form a characteristic energy band due to varying amounts of radiation emitted by clouds in different channels.</description>

      <title>Petrov types, separability and generalized photon surfaces of supergravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum and electrovacuum Einstein equations for spacetimes with two commuting Killing vectors can be solved by indirect methods of integrable systems. But if, in addition, the spacetime admits an irreducible Killing tensor and the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation is separable, they can be integrated directly by separation of variables, as shown by Carter in 1968. We generalize this approach to supergravity and derive a metric ansatz that ensures the above properties for Petrov-type $I$. Our derivation is based on the Benenti-Francavilla ansatz for metrics admitting two commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. We find additional constraints that guarantee the existence of two shear-free null geodesic congruences and the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting class of metrics belongs to a certain sector of Petrov type $I$, called $I_B$, whose algebraically special subsector contains only type $D$. For this class, a direct integration of the supergravity equations seems possible. We also show that these spacetimes admit a general description of the generalized photon and massive particle surfaces recently introduced in connection with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Constant roll and non-Gaussian tail in light of logarithmic duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.</description>

      <title>Consistent Truncations and Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in generalised geometry and extended field theories suggests a deep connection between consistent truncations and dualities, which is not immediately obvious. A prime example is generalised Scherk-Schwarz reductions in double field theory, which have been shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with Poisson-Lie T-duality. Here we demonstrate that this relation is only the tip of the iceberg. Currently, the most general known classes of T-dualities (excluding mirror symmetry) are based on dressing cosets. But as we discuss, they can be further extended to the even larger class of generalised cosets. We prove that the latter give rise to consistent truncations for which the ansatz can be constructed systematically. Hence, we pave the way for many new examples of T-dualities and consistent truncations. The arising structures result in covariant tensors with more than two derivatives and we argue how they might be key to understand generalised T-dualities and consistent truncations beyond the leading two derivative level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised parallelisable spaces permit to uplift many maximal gauged supergravities to ten or eleven dimensions. While some of the former are explicitly known, the literature is still lacking a systematic construction and a complete classification. We resolve this issue and present an explicit construction, and with it a full classification, of generalised parallelisable spaces for maximal gauged supergravities in four or more dimensions. All embedding tensors that can be realised without breaking the section condition of exceptional field theory are identified and the corresponding generalised frame fields are constructed. This finally resolved the old question: "Which maximal gauged supergravities have uplifts to 10/11d?". Furthermore, it provides the basis to explore solution generating techniques based on generalised dualities.</description>

Abstract: Four-dimensional all-loop amplitudes in QED and gravity exhibit universal Infrared (IR) singularities with a factorization structure. This structure is governed by tree amplitudes and a universal IR-divergent factor representing the exchange of soft particles between external lines. This letter offers a precise dual interpretation of these universal IR-divergent factors within celestial holography. Considering the tree amplitude as the foundation of the celestial conformal field theory (CCFT), these universal factors correspond to marginal deformations with a \textit{double-current} construction in the CCFT. Remarkably, a novel geometric representation of these deformations through topological gauging provides an exact description of transitions within bulk vacuum moduli spaces which extends the celestial holography beyond the perturbative level. Our findings establish a concrete dictionary for celestial holography and offer a holographic lens to understand loop corrections in scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Using a recently developed formulation of double field theory in superspace, the graviton, $B$-field, gravitini, dilatini, and Ramond-Ramond bispinor are encoded in a single generalized supervielbein. Duality transformations are encoded as orthosymplectic transformations, extending the bosonic $O(D,D)$ duality group, and these act on all constituents of the supervielbein in an easily computable way. We first review conventional non-abelian T-duality in the Green-Schwarz superstring and describe the dual geometries in the language of double superspace. Since dualities are related to super-Killing vectors, this includes as special cases both abelian and non-abelian fermionic T-duality.
  We then extend this approach to include Poisson-Lie T-duality and its generalizations, including the generalized coset construction recently discussed in arXiv:1912.11036. As an application, we construct the supergeometries associated with the integrable $\lambda$ and $\eta$ deformations of the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ superstring. The deformation parameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$ are identified with the possible one-parameter embeddings of the supergravity frame within the doubled supergeometry. In this framework, the Ramond-Ramond bispinors are directly computable purely from the algebraic data of the supergroup.</description>

      <title>The Magic Renormalisability of Affine Gaudin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalisation of a large class of integrable $\sigma$-models obtained in the framework of affine Gaudin models. They are characterised by a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a rational twist function $\varphi(z)$ with simple zeros, a double pole at infinity but otherwise no further restrictions on the pole structure. The crucial tool used in our analysis is the interpretation of these integrable theories as $\mathcal{E}$-models, which are $\sigma$-models studied in the context of Poisson-Lie T-duality and which are known to be at least one- and two-loop renormalisable. The moduli space of $\mathcal{E}$-models still contains many non-integrable theories. We identify the submanifold formed by affine Gaudin models and relate its tangent space to curious matrices and semi-magic squares. In particular, these results provide a criteria for the stability of these integrable models under the RG-flow. At one loop, we show that this criteria is satisfied and derive a very simple expression for the RG-flow of the twist function, proving a conjecture made earlier in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to extract the low energy behavior of physical observables from their high energy expansions, systematically calculable via the operator product expansion (OPE), in asymptotically free and mass-gapped theories. By applying the inverse Laplace transform to correlation functions, their analytic structure is modified such that low-energy information connects with high energy expansions. Furthermore, this transformation alleviates the renormalon problem, enabling a more straightforward application of the OPE compared to the OPE before the transformation. We demonstrate that the low energy limit of correlation functions can be accurately extracted using the OPE in the two dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model, serving as a first testing ground.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new closed form expressions for the partition functions of free conformally-coupled scalars on $S^{2D-1}\times S^1$ which resum the exact high-temperature expansion. The derivation relies on an identification of the partition functions, analytically continued in chemical potentials and temperature, with multiple elliptic Gamma functions. These functions satisfy interesting modular properties, which we use to arrive at our expressions. We describe a geometric interpretation of the modular properties of multiple elliptic Gamma functions in the context of superconformal field theory. Based on this, we suggest a geometric interpretation of the modular property in the context of the free scalar CFT in even dimensions and comment on extensions to odd dimensions and free fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Nicolai map for the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, in the light-cone gauge, to the second order in the coupling constant for all critical dimensions (d=3,4,6,10). The process of integrating out unphysical degrees of freedom in this gauge, produces a four fermion interaction term. We show that, to the order investigated here, this term is harmless. We demonstrate the existence of a particularly `simple' map in d=4 in the light-cone gauge and address the issue of uniqueness in the context of the map. We also investigate the map in the light-cone superspace in d=4.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a high energy scattering of free scalar particles through a gravitational field. The one particle t-channel amplitude of the scattering in this limit is governed by reggeized graviton. Therefore, we discuss an appearance of the reggeized gravitons in the framework of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and consider Lipatov's effective action for the reggeized gravitons. We calculate the trajectory of the corresponding $t$-channel amplitude in the framework and thereafter define the leading order amplitude of scattering of two massive scalar particles. An impact factor of the interaction of scalar particle with the reggeized gravitons is also calculated and possible applications of the approach are discussed as well.</description>

Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effects of electric fields along compact directions within (supersymmetric) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times{\mathbb T}^2 (\times{\mathbb T}^2\times{\mathbb T}^2)$. The electric field along compact directions is equivalent to time-dependent homogeneous configuration of Wilson line moduli, which would be relevant to physics in the early universe. In particular, we consider models with and without background magnetic fluxes, which lead to completely different effects of the electric field due to the difference in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) level structure. We show that, in the case without magnetic fluxes, the deceleration of KK momenta may cause non-perturbative KK particle production dubbed as the KK Schwinger effect, whereas in the case with magnetic flux such KK particle production does not take place but flavor structure of low energy effective theory may be affected.</description>

Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous efforts to quantify the entanglement generated in Hawking's evaporation process by including rotation and thermal environments (e.g. the cosmic microwave background). Both extensions are needed to describe real black holes in our universe. Leveraging techniques from Gaussian quantum information, we find that the black hole's ergoregion is an active source of quantum entanglement and that thermal environments drastically degrade entanglement generation. Our predictions are suitable to be tested in the lab using analogue platforms and also provide tools to assess the fate of quantum information for black holes in more generic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a propagating scalar field on Kaluza-Klein-type cosmological background. It is shown that this geometrical description of the Universe resembles - from a Hamiltonian standpoint - a damped harmonic oscillator with mass and frequency, both time-dependents. In this scenario, we construct the squeezed coherent states (SCSs) for the quantized scalar field by employing the invariant operator method of Lewis-Riesenfeld (non-Hermitian) in a non-unitary approach. The non-classicality of SCSs has been discussed by examining the quadrature squeezing properties from the uncertainty principle. Moreover, we compute the probability density, which allows us to investigate whether SCSs can be used to seek traces of extra dimensions. We then analyze the effects of the existence of supplementary space on cosmological particle production in SCSs by considering different cosmological eras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the phenomenology of inverse localization length on the Krylov chain that undergoes delocalization/localization transition on the Krylov chain while the physical system undergoes ergodicity breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different operators in the ergodic regime. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Unitarity in the non-relativistic regime and implications for dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity sets upper limits on partial-wave elastic and inelastic cross-sections, which are often violated by perturbative computations. We discuss the dynamics underlying these limits in the non-relativistic regime, namely long-range interactions, and show how the resummation of the 2-particle-irreducible diagrams arising from squaring inelastic processes unitarizes both elastic and inelastic cross-sections. We provide a simple prescription to obtain the unitarized cross-sections from those that do not include resummation of the squared inelastic processes. Our results are model-independent, apply to all partial waves, and affect elastic and inelastic cross-sections, with extensive implications for new physics scenarios, such as dark-matter freeze-out, indirect detection and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

      <title>On the absence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME): the generation of an electric current due to a homogeneous background magnetic field and a homogeneous chiral imbalance in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading coefficient describing the CME vanishes in equilibrium, both for free fermions as well as in full QCD. Our full QCD results are based on continuum extrapolated lattice simulations using dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses as well as quenched Wilson quarks. We show that it is crucial that a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization is used to compute the CME and elaborate on why some of the existing in-equilibrium calculations of this effect gave a nonzero result. We stress that our findings imply the absence of a time-independent CME current flowing in equilibrium QCD, but do not concern the CME as an out-of-equilibrium, time-dependent effect.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy levels for Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates and we use the tetrads formalism. Solving a second-order differential equation for the two components of the Dirac spinor, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, and the relativistic energy levels of the fermion and antifermion, where such levels are quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the two components of the spinor), curvature and rotation parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (describes the conical curvature and the angular momentum of the spinning cosmic string), and on the vorticity parameter $\Omega$ (describes the G\"odel-type spacetime). In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of $\Omega$ (i.e. $\Omega$ acts as a kind of ``external field or potential''). We see that for $m_j&gt;0$, the energy levels do not depend on $s$ and $u$; however, depend on $n$, $m_j$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$. In this case, $\alpha$ breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels and such levels can increase infinitely in the limit $\frac{4\Omega\beta}{\alpha}\to 1$. Already for $m_j&lt;0$, we see that the energy levels depends on $s$, $u$ and $n$; however, it no longer depends on $m_j$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In this case, it is as if the fermion ``lives only in a flat G\"odel-type spacetime''. Besides, we also study the low-energy or nonrelativistic limit of the system. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of energy levels as a function of $\Omega$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ extension of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of how to build a class of $f(R)$ extensions of General Relativity which are compatible with solar system experiments, without making any preliminary assumption on the properties of $f$. The aim is reached by perturbatively solving the modified Einstein equations around a Schwarzschild background and retrieving a posteriori the corresponding $f(R)$. This turns out to be non analytical in $R=0$ and should be intended as the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the low curvature limit. The parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ class are then set by constraining the corrections to four different local tests with the observations. The result is a class of $f(R)$ theories built up from a purely bottom-up approach and compatible with the local tests. At a more general level, this result can help constraining exact $f(R)$ models working in Cosmology, since it provides the correct local limit. Further developments and possible extensions of the approach to Cosmology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entangled pairs in evaporating black holes without event horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional Riemannian general relativity as a spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper $4$ dimensional Riemannian (or Euclidean) vacuum general relativity is recovered from a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking within a quantum field theory (all in the sense of the operator algebraic approach to quantum field theory) provided by the unique ${\rm II}_1$ hyperfinite factor von Neumann algebra. The formal temperature of this phase transition is $T=\frac{1}{2}T_{\rm Planck}\approx7.06\times 10^{31}{\rm K}$. (For an extended abstract see the text.)</description>

      <title>G\"odel-type spacetimes in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. Noncausal and causal solutions exist depending on the matter content. For a perfect fluid, out of all G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is allowed in $f(Q)$ gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy conditions be obeyed by the fluid leads to mild restrictions on $f(Q)$. For a massless scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, there are causal solutions for any reasonable function $f(Q)$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation of accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider accelerating black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime and investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of black holes and their extremality bounds. It is shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid for accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate matching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the relation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the parameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south poles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality relations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a class of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras associated to connections on spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra which arises in the physics literature on supergravity to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and squaring map, and also allowing for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples of such algebras on higher-dimensional spheres. We demonstrate that the definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle -- provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres -- and obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>
