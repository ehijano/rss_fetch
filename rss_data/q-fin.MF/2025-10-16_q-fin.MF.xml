      <title>The Variance-Gamma Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of random-time subordination in modelling stock-price dynamics, and We first present results on the Laplace distribution as a Gaussian variance-mixture, in particular a more efficient volatility estimation procedure through the absolute moments. We generalise the Laplace model to characterise the powerful variance gamma model of Madan et al. as a Gamma time-subordinated Brownian motion to price European call options via an Esscher transform method. We find that the Variance Gamma model is able to empirically explain excess kurtosis found in log-returns data, rejecting a Black-Scholes assumption in a hypothesis test.</description>

      <title>On Time-subordinated Brownian Motion Processes for Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key purpose of this paper is to present Fourier method to model the stochastic time-change in this context of time-subordinated Brownian motion models. We review Gaussian Variance-Mean mixtures and time-subordinated models with a key example of the Gamma process. A non-parametric characteristic function decomposition of subordinated Brownian motion is presented. This allows one to characterise and study the stochastic time-change directly from the full process. Finally we provide an example empirical decomposition of S$\&amp;$P log-returns. We explore the Variance Gamma process as a key example throughout.</description>

      <title>Testing by Betting while Borrowing and Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing by betting has been a cornerstone of the game-theoretic statistics literature. In this framework, a betting score (or more generally an e-process), as opposed to a traditional p-value, is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis: the higher the betting score, the more money one has made betting against the null, and thus the larger the evidence that the null is false. A key ingredient assumed throughout past works is that one cannot bet more money than one currently has. In this paper, we ask what happens if the bettor is allowed to borrow money after going bankrupt, allowing further financial flexibility in this game of hypothesis testing. We propose various definitions of (adjusted) evidence relative to the wealth borrowed, indebted, and accumulated. We also ask what happens if the bettor can "bargain", in order to obtain odds bettor than specified by the null hypothesis. The adjustment of wealth in order to serve as evidence appeals to the characterization of arbitrage, interest rates, and num\'eraire-adjusted pricing in this setting.</description>
