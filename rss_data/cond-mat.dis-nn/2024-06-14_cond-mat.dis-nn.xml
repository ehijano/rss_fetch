      <title>Refined cyclic renormalization group in Russian Doll model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Russian Doll Model (RDM) of superconductivity for finite energy levels. Previously, cyclic renormalization group (RG) and Efimov scaling were found in RDM for part of the equidistant spectrum and we generalize this observation in a few directions. We find that when the whole spectrum is considered, equidistancy condition is removed or diagonal disorder is added, the cyclicity of RG survives but the period of RG becomes energy dependent. The analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden medium-range order in silicate glass-formers using many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medium range order (MRO) in amorphous systems has been linked to complex features such as the dynamic heterogeneity of supercooled liquids or the plastic deformation of glasses. However, the nature of the MRO in these materials has remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods capable of characterizing this order. Here, we leverage standard two-body structural correlators and advanced many-body correlation functions to probe numerically the MRO in prototypical network glassformers, i.e., silica and sodium silicates, systems that are of importance in natural as well as industrial settings. With increasing Na concentration, one finds that the local environment of Na becomes more structured and the spatial distribution of Na on intermediate length scales changes from blob-like to channel-like, indicating a growing inhomogeneity in the spatial Na arrangement. In parallel, we find that the Si-O network becomes increasingly depolymerized, resulting in a ring size distribution that broadens. The radius of gyration of the rings is well described by a power-law with an exponent around 0.75, indicating that the rings are progressively more crumbled with increasing size. Using a recently proposed four-point correlation function, we reveal that the relative orientation of the tetrahedra shows a transition at a distance around 4 Angstroms, a structural modification that is not seen in standard two-point correlation functions. Furthermore, we find that the length scale characterizing the MRO is non-monotonic as a function of temperature, caused by the competition between energetic and entropic terms. Finally, we demonstrate that the structural correlation lengths as obtained from the correlation functions that quantify the MRO are correlated with macroscopic observables such as the kinetic fragility of the liquids and the elastic properties of the glasses.</description>

      <title>Link to Densify: Topological Transition During the Compression of Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the structural and topological transition between amorphous ices. We discover that applying external pressure to low-density amorphous ice (LDA) distorts the looped motifs constituting the hydrogen bond network (HBN). The transition to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) is accompanied by an abrupt topological transition of the HBN, which starts to display interpenetrated and Hopf linked looped motifs. This topologically linked HBN is metastable during decompression, and the links disentangle through a first order transition at the critical point. We discover that the rearrangement of the HBN motifs at the transitions induce a loss of mechanical rigidity, dramatically increasing compressiblity. We argue that topological transitions may be a generic mechanism for the densification of network-forming amorphous materials and enriches our understanding of the properties of water.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <title>Investigating meV-scale Equilibrium Atomic Dynamics with X-Rays: focus on disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews non-resonant meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) as a complementary method to inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Two aspects of IXS that are notable in this context are (1) that IXS allows straightforward measurements of phonons in small (sub-mm, and even $\sim 0.01$ mm) samples with $\sim 1$ meV resolution and excellent Q resolution and (2) that IXS avoids the kinematic constraints of INS. The first allows both new geometries (thin films, diamond anvil cells) and easy access to new materials, while the second allows high quality data on disordered materials, such as scans with sub-meV resolution to arbitrarily high energy transfer become possible , even at momentum transfers as small as 1/nm. The review briefly discusses the spectrometers and compares the practical forms for the dynamic structure factor for crystals, glasses and liquids. This is followed by a longer review of work on liquids and then shorter discussion of work on glasses, crystals, and discussion of specific geometries. This paper complements the longer introduction/review of IXS at arxiv:1504.01098 .</description>

      <title>Wavefront shaping simulations with augmented partial factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping can tailor multipath interference to control multiple scattering of waves in complex optical systems. However, full-wave simulations that capture multiple scattering are computationally demanding given the large system size and the large number of input channels. Recently, an "augmented partial factorization" (APF) method was proposed to significantly speed-up such full-wave simulations. In this tutorial, we illustrate how to perform wavefront shaping simulations with the APF method using the open-source frequency-domain electromagnetic scattering solver MESTI. We present the foundational concepts and then walk through four examples: computing the scattering matrix of a slab with random permittivities, open high-transmission channels through disorder, focusing inside disorder with phase conjugation, and reflection matrix computation in a spatial focused-beam basis. The goal is to lower the barrier for researchers to use simulations to explore the rich phenomena enabled by wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common in deep learning to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments using SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape. The ability to handle larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam which provides benefits similar to warmup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address the challenges of image super-resolution and noise reduction, which are crucial for enhancing the quality of images derived from low-resolution or noisy data. We compared and assessed several approaches for upgrading low-resolution images to higher resolutions and for eliminating unwanted noise, all while maintaining the essential characteristics of the original images and recovering images from poor quality or damaged data using deep learning models. Our analysis and the experimental outcomes on image quality metrics indicate that the EDCNN neural network model, enhanced with pretrained weights, significantly outperforms other methods with a Train PSNR of 31.215, a Valid PSNR of 29.493, and a Test PSNR of 31.6632.</description>

      <title>BerryEasy: A GPU enabled python package for diagnosis of nth-order and spin-resolved topology in the presence of fields and effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple software packages currently exist for the computation of bulk topological invariants in both idealized tight-binding models and realistic Wannier tight-binding models derived from density functional theory. Currently, only one package, PythTB(https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) is capable of computing nested Wilson loops and spin-resolved Wilson loops. These state-of-the-art techniques are vital for accurate analysis of band topology. In this paper we introduce BerryEasy, a python package which is built to work alongside the PyBinding(https://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/index.html) software package. By working in tandem with the Pybinding package and harnessing the speed of graphical processing units, topological analysis of supercells in the presence of disorder and impurities is made possible. The BerryEasy package simultaneously accommodates use of realistic tight-binding models developed using Wannier90.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in the Manna Model, Conserved Directed Percolation and Depinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity is an emergent property, whereby the structure factor of the density $n$ scales as $S(q) \sim q^\alpha$, with $\alpha&gt;0$. We show that for the conserved directed percolation (CDP) class, to which the Manna model belongs, there is an exact mapping between the density $n$ in CDP, and the interface position $u$ at depinning, $n(x)=n_0+\nabla^2 u(x)$, where $n_0$ is the conserved particle density. As a consequence, the hyperuniformity exponent equals $\alpha={4-d-2\zeta}$, with $\zeta$ the roughness exponent at depinning, and $d$ the dimension. In $d=1$, $\alpha=1/2$, while $0.6&gt; \alpha\ge0$ for other $d$. Our results fit well simulations in the literature, except in $d=1$, where we perform our own to confirm this result. Such an exact relation between two seemingly different fields is surprising, and paves new paths to think about hyperuniformity and depinning. As corollaries, we get results of unprecedented precision in all dimensions, exact in $d=1$. This corrects earlier work on hyperuniformity in CDP.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning with generative models for object detection on limited datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of data is limited in some fields, especially for object detection tasks, where it is necessary to have correctly labeled bounding boxes around each object. A notable example of such data scarcity is found in the domain of marine biology, where it is useful to develop methods to automatically detect submarine species for environmental monitoring. To address this data limitation, the state-of-the-art machine learning strategies employ two main approaches. The first involves pretraining models on existing datasets before generalizing to the specific domain of interest. The second strategy is to create synthetic datasets specifically tailored to the target domain using methods like copy-paste techniques or ad-hoc simulators. The first strategy often faces a significant domain shift, while the second demands custom solutions crafted for the specific task. In response to these challenges, here we propose a transfer learning framework that is valid for a generic scenario. In this framework, generated images help to improve the performances of an object detector in a few-real data regime. This is achieved through a diffusion-based generative model that was pretrained on large generic datasets. With respect to the state-of-the-art, we find that it is not necessary to fine tune the generative model on the specific domain of interest. We believe that this is an important advance because it mitigates the labor-intensive task of manual labeling the images in object detection tasks. We validate our approach focusing on fishes in an underwater environment, and on the more common domain of cars in an urban setting. Our method achieves detection performance comparable to models trained on thousands of images, using only a few hundreds of input data. Our results pave the way for new generative AI-based protocols for machine learning applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>
