      <title>Introducing cosmosTNG: simulating galaxy formation with constrained realizations of the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new cosmological simulation project cosmosTNG, a first-of-its-kind suite of constrained galaxy formation simulations for the universe at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim 2$). cosmosTNG simulates a $0.2$ deg$^2$ patch of the COSMOS field at $z \simeq 2.0-2.2$ using an initial density field inferred from galaxy redshift surveys and the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest tomography survey, reconstructed by the TARDIS algorithm. We evolve eight different realizations of this volume to capture small-scale variations. All runs use the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model with a baryonic mass resolution of $10^6$ M$_\odot$, equal to TNG100-1. In this initial study, we demonstrate qualitative agreement between the evolved large-scale structure and the spatial distribution of observed galaxy populations in COSMOS, emphasizing the zFIRE protocluster region. We then compare the statistical properties and scaling relations of the galaxy population, covering stellar, gaseous, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) components, between cosmosTNG, observations in COSMOS, and $z \sim 2$ observational data in general. We find that galaxy quenching and environmental effects in COSMOS are modulated by its specific large-scale structure, particularly the collapsing protoclusters in the region. With respect to a random region of the universe, the abundance of high-mass galaxies is larger, and the quenched fraction of galaxies is significant lower at fixed mass. This suggests an accelerated growth of stellar mass, as reflected in a higher cosmic star formation rate density, due to the unique assembly histories of galaxies in the simulated COSMOS subvolume. The cosmosTNG suite will be a valuable tool for studying galaxy formation at cosmic noon, particularly when interpreting extragalactic observations with HST, JWST, and other large multi-wavelength survey programs of the COSMOS field.</description>

      <title>The Ancient Star Formation History of the Extremely Low-Mass Galaxy Leo P: An Emerging Trend of a Post-Reionization Pause in Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated, low-mass galaxies provide the opportunity to assess the impact of reionization on their star formation histories (SFHs) without the ambiguity of environmental processes associated with massive host galaxies. There are very few isolated, low-mass galaxies that are close enough to determine their SFHs from resolved star photometry reaching below the oldest main sequence turnoff. JWST has increased the volume for which this is possible, and here we report on JWST observations of the low-mass, isolated galaxy Leo P. From NIRCam imaging in F090W, F150W, and F277W, we derive a SFH which shows early star formation followed by a pause subsequent to the epoch of reionization which is then later followed by a re-ignition of star formation. This is very similar to the SFHs from previous studies of other dwarf galaxies in the ``transition zone'' between quenched very low-mass galaxies and the more massive galaxies which show no evidence of the impact of reionization on their SFHs; this pattern is rarely produced in simulations of SFHs. The lifetime SFH reveals that Leo P's stellar mass at the epoch of reionization was in the range that is normally associated with being totally quenched. The extended pause in star formation from z~5-1 has important implications for the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the UV photon budget at intermediate redshifts. We also demonstrate that, due to higher sensitivity and angular resolution, observing in two NIRCam short wavelength filters is superior to observing in a combination of a short and a long wavelength filter.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Dust Biases Photometric Redshifts and Stellar Masses for LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling is one of the main methods to estimate galaxy properties, such as photometric redshifts, $z$, and stellar masses, $M_*$, for extragalactic imaging surveys. SEDs are currently modeled as light from a composite stellar population attenuated by a uniform foreground dust screen, despite evidence from simulations and observations that find large spatial variations in dust attenuation due to the detailed geometry of stars and gas within galaxies. In this work, we examine the impact of this simplistic dust assumption on inferred $z$ and $M_*$ for Rubin LSST. We first construct synthetic LSST-like observations ($ugrizy$ magnitudes) from the NIHAO-SKIRT catalog, which provides SEDs from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We then infer $z$ and $M_*$ from the synthetic observations using the PROVABGS Bayesian SED modeling framework. Overall, the uniform dust screen assumption biases both $z$ and $M_*$ in galaxies, consistently and significantly for galaxies with dust attenuation $A_V \gtrsim 0.5$, and likely below. The biases depend on the orientation in which the galaxies are observed. At $z=0.4$, $z$ is overestimated by $\sim$0.02 for face-on galaxies and $M_*$ is underestimated by $\sim$0.4 dex for edge-on galaxies. The bias in photo-$z$ is equivalent to the desired redshift precision level of LSST "gold sample" and will be larger at higher redshifts. Our results underscore the need for SED models with additional flexibility in the dust parameterization to mitigate significant systematic biases in cosmological analyses with LSST.</description>

      <title>Value Added Catalog of physical properties of more than 1.3 million galaxies from the DESI Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present an extensive catalog of the physical properties of more than a million galaxies within the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), one of the largest spectroscopic surveys to date. Spanning over a full variety of target types, including emission line galaxies and luminous red galaxies as well as quasars, our survey encompasses an unprecedented range of spectroscopic redshifts, stretching from 0 to 6.
  Methods. The physical properties, such as stellar masses and star formation rates, are derived via the CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code accounting for the contribution coming from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the modeling of the optical-mid-infrared (grz complemented by WISE photometry) SEDs, we study galaxy properties with respect to their location on the main sequence.
  Results. We revise the dependence of stellar mass estimates on model choices and availability of the WISE photometry. The WISE information is mandatory to minimize the misclassification of star-forming galaxies as AGN. The lack of WISE bands in SED fits leads to elevated AGN fractions for 68% of star-forming galaxies identified using emission line diagnostic diagram but does not significantly affect their stellar mass nor star formation estimates.</description>

      <title>MAGICS III. Seeds sink swiftly: nuclear star clusters dramatically accelerate seed black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merger rate predictions of Massive Black Hole (MBH) seeds from large-scale cosmological simulations differ widely, with recent studies highlighting the challenge of low-mass MBH seeds failing to reach the galactic center, a phenomenon known as the seed sinking problem. In this work, we tackle this issue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations from the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution $N$-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that only MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we extend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our models. Utilizing $N$-body resimulations with up to $10^7$ particles, we demonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic environment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions, significantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This process leads to the formation of a hard binary in $\lesssim 500$ Myr after the onset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in 8 out of 12 models, the high stellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating gravitational wave (GW) mergers by redshift $z = 4$. We conclude that at $z &gt; 4$, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a merger rate of $0.3$--$0.6\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z = 4$, which is approximately 300--600 times higher than in non-NSC environments. In contrast, in environments without NSCs, surrounding dark matter plays a more significant role in loss-cone scattering.</description>

      <title>The discovery and evolution of a radio continuum and excited-OH spectral-line outburst in the nearby galaxy NGC 660</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arecibo 305-m Telescope observations between 2008 and 2018 detected a radio continuum and spectral-line outburst in the nearby galaxy, NGC 660. Excited-OH maser emission/absorption lines near 4.7 GHz, and H$_2$CO absorption at 4.83 GHz varied on time-scales of months. Simultaneously, a continuum outburst occurred in which a new compact component appeared, with a GHz-peaked spectrum and a 5-GHz flux density that rose to a peak value of about 500 mJy from 2008.0 to 2012.0. Follow-up interferometric continuum images from theVery Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz of this new continuum component determined it to be located at the nucleus of NGC 660. Subsequent High Sensitivity Array (HSA) line and continuum VLBI observations of the NGC 660 nucleus revealed a morphology that appears to be consistent with rapidly-precessing, mildly-relativistic jets from the central black hole. While requiring detailed modeling, this strongly suggests that the outburst is due to nuclear activity. From its time-scale, the shape of the continuum light-curve, and the milliarcsec radio structure, the most likely cause of the outburst is AGN-type activity of accretion of a gas cloud onto the central black hole.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions $-$ XVII. High-mass star-formation through a large-scale collapse in IRAS 15394$-$5358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hub-filament systems are considered as natural sites for high-mass star formation. Kinematic analysis of the surroundings of hub-filaments is essential to better understand high-mass star formation within such systems. In this work, we present a detailed study of the massive Galactic protocluster IRAS 15394$-$5358, using continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey. The 3~mm dust continuum map reveals the fragmentation of the massive ($\rm M=843~M_{\odot}$) clump into six cores. The core C-1A is the largest (radius = 0.04~pc), the most massive ($\rm M=157~M_{\odot}$), and lies within the dense central region, along with two smaller cores ($\rm M=7~and~3~M_{\odot}$). The fragmentation process is consistent with the thermal Jeans fragmentation mechanism and virial analysis shows that all the cores have small virial parameter values ($\rm \alpha_{vir}&lt;&lt;2$), suggesting that the cores are gravitationally bound. The mass vs. radius relation indicates that three cores can potentially form at least a single massive star. The integrated intensity map of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+}$ shows that the massive clump is associated with a hub-filament system, where the central hub is linked with four filaments. A sharp velocity gradient is observed towards the hub, suggesting a global collapse where the filaments are actively feeding the hub. We discuss the role of global collapse and the possible driving mechanisms for the massive star formation activity in the protocluster.</description>

      <title>A Search for $z=5$ H$\alpha$ and H$\beta+$[O III] Dual-Line Emitting Galaxies in the JWST CEERS Field: Implications for the AGN Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to uncover faint galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. Taking advantage of the unique filter combination used in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) program, we perform an extensive photometric search of galaxies emitting strong H$\beta+$[O III] and H$\alpha$ lines. The redshift range of the galaxies is limited to $5.03\leq z\leq 5.26$ by requiring photometric excesses in NIRCam's F277W and F410M images. A total of 261 H$\beta+$[O III] and H$\alpha$ dual-line emitters are found over the absolute UV magnitude $-22\lesssim M_{\mathrm{UV}}\lesssim -17$, with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of 1010 A for H$\beta+$[O III] and 1040 A for H$\alpha$. This population accounts for $\sim 40\%$ of the Lyman break galaxies at this redshift range. Intriguingly, there are 58 objects (22% of the whole sample) that exhibit compact morphology at the rest-UV or optical wavelength. With an assumption that these compact dual-line emitters are dominated by AGN, their AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range of $2\times 10^{43} \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/({\rm erg~s}^{-1})\lesssim 3\times 10^{44}$. Their number density is two orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation from the UV-selected luminous quasars, which is in good agreement with previous JWST studies of broad-line AGNs, requiring a $\sim 10\%$ of the AGN duty cycle. Moreover, our dual-line emitter sample reaches the faint end of the H$\alpha$ and [O III] luminosity functions down to $\lesssim 10^{42}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are planned in an approved JWST Cycle 3 program, in which we aim to confirm their nature, characterize their black hole activity, and construct their mass distribution at $10^6\lesssim M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8$.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Discovery of two cyano derivatives of acenaphthylene (C$_{12}$H$_8$) in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery in TMC-1 of two cyano derivatives of the PAH acenaphthylene (C$_{12}$H$_8$). We have found two series of lines with the QUIJOTE line survey that we assign to 1-C$_{12}$H$_7$CN and 5-C$_{12}$H$_7$CN. For the 1-isomer, we have detected and assigned 173 rotational transitions with $J$ up to 46 and $K_a$ up to 9, corresponding to 107 independent frequencies. For the 5-isomer, the identification is based on 56 individual lines, corresponding to 117 rotational transitions with $J$ up to 40 and $K_a$ up to 8. Identification of the carriers was achieved through a careful analysis of the derived rotational constants, which permit us to focus on molecules larger than naphthalene but smaller than anthracene and phenanthrene. Moreover, the derived rotational constants indicate that the species are planar; this allows us to discard derivatives of fluorene and acenaphthene, which are non-planar species. Quantum chemical calculations and subsequent chemical synthesis of these molecules, as well as the observation of their rotational transitions in the laboratory, unequivocally support our identifications. We also confirm, via a robust line-by-line detection, the previous claimed detection of 1- and 2- cyanonaphthalene, which were obtained through statistical stacking techniques. The column densities of 1- and 5-cyanoacenaphthylene are (9.5\,$\pm$\,0.9)$\,\times$\,10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, while those of 1- and 2-cyanonapthalene are (5.5\,$\pm$\,0.5)$\,\times$\,10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. Hence, it seems that acenaphthylene could be a factor of 1.7 more abundant than naphthalene. These results support a scenario in which PAHs grow in cold dark clouds based on fused five- and six-membered carbon rings.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics IV: Non Rotating Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we find in Einstein Gravity a single-metric solution for a point mass residing in an expanding universe \cite{wong}, which apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional MOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the cosmological acceleration $\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. We study a protogalactic cloud in this acceleration such that an overdensity mass shell growth stops at its turnaround point and and every point on the shell picks up maximum but non systematic angular momentum. Assuming an initial power law matter density distribution, the central region of the virialised sphere is Newtoinan acceleration dominant but in its outer-most region the dominant acceleration is MOND-like. We evaluate the effective MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ at the redshift where the early virialisation occurs. We find that $a_0^{VM}\sim a_0$. Working with a realistic overdensity at recombination, the central core can form a Quasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by $z&gt; 7$, which could explain the galaxy morphology stability observations for $z&lt;6.5$ in \cite{ferreira2}.</description>

      <title>The GD-1 stellar stream perturber as a core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GD-1 stellar stream exhibits spur and gap structures that may result from a close encounter with a dense substructure. When interpreted as a dark matter subhalo, the perturber is denser than predicted in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), however, a halo could evolve into a phase of gravothermal collapse, resulting in a higher central density than its CDM counterpart. We conduct high-resolution controlled N-body simulations to show that a collapsed SIDM halo could account for the GD-1 perturber's high density. We model a progenitor halo with a mass of $3\times10^8~M_\odot$, motivated by a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way analog, and evolve it in the Milky Way's tidal field. For a cross section per mass of $\sigma/m\approx30-100~{\rm cm^2~g^{-1}}$ at $V_{\rm max }\sim10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the enclosed mass of the SIDM halo within the inner $10~{\rm pc}$ can be increased by more than an order of magnitude compared to its CDM counterpart, leading to a good agreement with the properties of the GD-1 perturber. Our findings indicate that stellar streams provide a novel probe into the self-interacting nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797 and 6614 {\AA} in Low-Resolution Spectra of Cool Stars from LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in over two million low-resolution spectra of cool stars from LAMOST. Based on the DIB measurements, the correlation between DIBs and extinction, the kinematics of DIBs, and the Galactic distribution of DIBs are reviewed and investigated from the perspective of statistics. A pipeline is developed to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. We obtain the DIB measurements of spectra of late-type stars from LAMOST, and screen out 176,831, 13,473 and 110,152 high-quality (HQ) measurements of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614, respectively, corresponding to 142,074, 11,480 and 85,301 unique sources. Utilizing these HQ measurements, we present the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern sky for the first time. The central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in air are determined to be 5780.48 $\pm$ 0.01, 5796.94 $\pm$ 0.02 and 6613.64 $\pm$ 0.01 {\AA}, respectively, based on their kinematics. The equivalent widths of these three DIBs per unit extinction are statistically fitted to be 0.565, 0.176 and 0.256 {\AA}/mag. As a part of our work, three catalogs of the HQ measurements for the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are provided online. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of measurements of these three DIBs to date. It is also the first time that the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern hemisphere are presented, and the central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are estimated from the kinematics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astronomy With TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Shining a Light on the Connections between Galactic Outflows Seen in Absorption and Emission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic outflows provide important feedback effects to regulate the evolution of the host galaxies. Two primary diagnostics of galactic outflows are broad and/or blueshifted emission and absorption lines. Even though well-established methods exist to analyze these outflow signatures, connections between them are rarely studied and largely unknown. In this paper, we present the first detailed comparisons of the outflow properties measured independently from the two outflow diagnostics for a sample of 33 low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Their UV absorption lines are detected by the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph, and optical emission lines are observed by the Keck/Echellette Spectrograph and Imager. We find that several outflow properties derived from emission and absorption lines are tightly correlated. These include outflow maximum velocity, line width, and sizes. Specifically, in a given galaxy, outflows seen in emission lines have smaller maximum velocities, narrower line widths, and smaller sizes than those measured from the absorption lines. These findings can be interpreted by the fact that emission line luminosity is weighted by density squared, while absorption line depth is weighted by density. We then test both spherical and bi-conical outflow models, and find the same outflow velocity and density distributions can explain the observed outflow features in emission and absorption lines for individual galaxies. These results provide novel calibration between galactic outflow properties measured from the two diagnostics and provide valuable insights for future models of galactic outflows by potentially doubling the number of observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Ruling out unitary Fermi gas of neutrinos as galactic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that galactic dark matter could be interacting fermions in the neutrino mass range. Assuming that galactic halos behave like a fluid in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, we employ the equation of state for a unitary Fermi gas to establish constraints on the mass of the fermion. Our findings effectively exclude neutrinos as candidates for galactic dark matter, and further reinforce earlier results suggesting that galactic dark matter is predominantly composed of light bosons.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Data Release 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stars of the Milky Way carry the chemical history of our Galaxy in their atmospheres as they journey through its vast expanse. Like barcodes, we can extract the chemical fingerprints of stars from high-resolution spectroscopy. The fourth data release (DR4) of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey, based on a decade of observations, provides the chemical abundances of up to 32 elements for 917 588 stars that also have exquisite astrometric data from the $Gaia$ satellite. For the first time, these elements include life-essential nitrogen to complement carbon, and oxygen as well as more measurements of rare-earth elements critical to modern-life electronics, offering unparalleled insights into the chemical composition of the Milky Way.
  For this release, we use neural networks to simultaneously fit stellar parameters and abundances across the full spectrum, leveraging synthetic grids computed with Spectroscopy Made Easy. These grids account for atomic line formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium for 14 elements. In a two-iteration process, we first fit stellar labels for all 1 085 520 spectra, then co-add repeated observations and refine these labels using astrometric data from $Gaia$ and 2MASS photometry, improving the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters and abundances. Our validation thoroughly assesses the reliability of spectroscopic measurements and highlights key caveats for catalogue users.
  GALAH DR4 represents yet another milestone in Galactic archaeology, combining detailed chemical compositions from multiple nucleosynthetic channels with kinematic information and age estimates. The resulting dataset, covering nearly a million stars, opens new avenues for understanding not only the chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way, but also the broader questions of the origin of elements and the evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.</description>

      <title>MAGICS II. Seed black holes stripped of their surrounding stars do not sink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MBH seed mergers are expected to be among the loudest sources of gravitational waves detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), providing a unique window into the birth and early growth of SMBH. We present the MAGICS-II simulation suite, consisting of 6 galaxy mergers that result in MBH seeds mergers identified in the cosmological simulation ASTRID. With the enhanced resolution (mass resolution: 500 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$; softening length: $5$ pc), improved subgrid models for the MBH dynamics and accretion, and the accurate regularized gravity integrator included in KETJU, we trace MBH seeds dynamics down to 0.1 pc. After evolving all the systems for $\approx$ 1.2 Gyr in three stages (MAGICS-2000, MAGICS-500, and MAGICS-K), we find in 4 of the 6 systems the MBHs stall at separations $ \Delta r \gtrsim 200$ pc. Only in 2 systems, the MBHs manage to sink further, and only in one of them a bound binary forms. In the sinking systems, the MBH retains a population of bound stars. The final separation between the MBH is related to the surrounding unstripped stellar (and/or dark matter) mass: if more than 90\% of the surrounding stellar system is stripped away, the MBHs stall. Besides the unstripped stars from the original host galaxy, we find that newly formed stars bound to the MBH significantly contribute to its sinking. Resolving the stellar system around MBH seeds, and its induced tidal interactions and dynamical friction is key for accurately capturing MBH dynamics. For this, high resolution simulations are required. In a companion paper (MAGICS-III), we resimulate the central regions of these systems with increased resolution to model directly the effects of actual star clusters around MBHs.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete census of luminous Compton-thick Active Galactic Nuclei in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray surveys provide the most efficient means for the detection of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, they face difficulties in detecting the most heavily obscured Compton-thick AGN. The BAT detector on board the Gehrels/Swift mission, operating in the very hard 14-195 keV band, has provided the largest samples of Compton-thick AGN in the local Universe. However, even these flux limited samples can miss the most obscured sources among the Compton-thick AGN population. A robust way to find these local sources is to systematically study volume-limited AGN samples detected in the IR or the optical part of the spectrum. Here, we utilize a local sample (&lt;100 Mpc) of mid-IR selected AGN, unbiased against obscuration, to determine the fraction of Compton-thick sources in the local universe. When available we acquire X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample from previously published studies. Additionally, to maximize the X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample, we analyse, for the first time, eleven unexplored XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, identifying four new Compton-thick sources. Our results reveal an increased fraction of Compton-thick AGN among the sources that have not been detected by BAT of 44 %. Overall we estimate a fraction of Compton thick sources in the local universe of 25-30% among mid-IR selected AGN. We find no evidence for evolution of the AGN Compton-thick fraction with luminosity.</description>

      <title>Toward robust physical and chemical characterization of heterogeneous lines of sight: The case of the Horsehead nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense cold molecular cores/filaments are surrounded by an envelope of translucent gas. Some of the low-J emission lines of CO and HCO$^+$ isotopologues are more sensitive to the conditions either in the translucent environment or in the dense cold one. We propose a cloud model composed of three homogeneous slabs of gas along each LoS, representing an envelope and a shielded inner layer. IRAM-30m data from the ORION-B large program toward the Horsehead nebula are used to demonstrate the method's capability. We use the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX to model the line profiles from the kinetic temperature $T_{kin}$, the volume density $n_{H_2}$, kinematics and chemical properties of the different layers. We then use a maximum likelihood estimator to simultaneously fit the lines of the CO and HCO$^+$ isotopologues. We constrain column density ratios to limit the variance on the estimates. This simple heterogeneous model provides good fits of the fitted lines over a large part of the cloud. The decomposition of the intensity into three layers allows to discuss the distribution of the estimated physical/chemical properties along the LoS. About 80$\%$ the CO integrated intensity comes from the envelope, while $\sim55\%$ of that of the (1-0) and (2-1) lines of C$^{18}$O comes from the inner layer. The $N(^{13}CO)/N(C^{18}O)$ in the envelope increases with decreasing $A_v$, and reaches $25$ in the pillar outskirts. The envelope $T_{kin}$ varies from 25 to 40 K, that of the inner layer drops to $\sim 15$ K in the western dense core. The inner layer $n_{H_2}$ is $\sim 3\times10^4\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ toward the filament and it increases by a factor $10$ toward dense cores. The proposed method correctly retrieves the physical/chemical properties of the Horsehead nebula and offers promising prospects for less supervised model fits of wider-field datasets.</description>

      <title>New HI observations Toward the NGC 5055 Galaxy Group with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new high-sensitivity HI mapping observation of the NGC 5055 galaxy group over an area of $1.^\circ5\times0.^\circ75$ with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our observation reveals that the warped H\,{\sc i} disk of NGC~5055 is more extended than what previously observed by WSRT, out to $ 23.'9$ (61.7 kpc). The total HI mass of NGC 5055 is determined to be $\rm\sim 1.1\times10^{10}\,M_\odot$. We identified three HI clouds with HI masses of the order of $\rm \sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ at the southeastern edge of the HI disk, as well as a candidate high-velocity cloud with an HI mass of $\rm (1.2\pm0.5) \times10^6\,M_\odot$ to the north of NGC 5055. The HI content of UGCA 337 is robustly detected for the first time by the FAST observations. It has a narrow HI linewidth of $W_{50}=17.4\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with a total \HI\ mass of ($\rm 3.5\pm0.3)\times10^6\,M_\odot$. Comparing the gas content and g-r color of UGCA 337 with typical low-mass dwarf galaxies, UGCA~337 appears relatively gas-poor despite its blue color. This suggests that UGCA 337 may have undergone gas stripping in the past. We also analyzed the possible origin of the diffuse HI clouds located at the outskirts of NGC 5055, and speculate that they might be the remnant features of a merger event in the past.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the mass--radius relation of expanding very young star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass--radius relation of embedded star clusters is an essentially important boundary condition for understanding the evolution of embedded clusters in which stars form to their release into the galactic field via an open star cluster phase. The initial mass--radius relation of embedded clusters deduced by Marks \&amp; Kroupa is significantly different from the relation suggested by Pfalzner et al. Here, direct N-body simulations are used to model the early expansion of embedded clusters after the expulsion of their residual gas. The observational data of radii of up to a few~Myr old clusters collated from various sources are found to be well fit by the N-body models, implying these observed very young clusters to most likely be in an expanding state. We show that the mass-radius relation of Pfalzner et al. reflects the expansion of embedded clusters following the initial mass-radius relation of Marks \&amp; Kroupa. We also suggest that even the embedded clusters in ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions are probably already in expansion. All here collected clusters from different observations show a mass-size relation with a similar slope, which may indicate that all clusters were born with a profile resembling that of the Plummer phase-space distribution function.</description>

      <title>Finding massive double-exponential disk galaxies with extended low surface brightness stellar disk -- an IllustrisTNG exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (stellar mass $&gt;$= 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ ) at $z=0$ from IllustrisTNG simulation to detect galaxies that contain two exponential stellar disks - a central high surface brightness (HSB) disk surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) envelope. This is motivated by observation of several giant LSB galaxies, reported in literature, showing such complex layered structure (e.g, Malin 1, UGC 1378, UGC 1382 etc). We use the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 data, and perform Sersic plus exponential profile modeling on the idealised, synthetic SDSS-g, r band images of the massive disk galaxies using GALFIT. We identify 7 disk galaxies (12$\%$ of the parent sample of disk galaxies) that are best represented by a central Sersic plus a central HSB disk surrounded by an extended LSB disk. The radial scale lengths of the LSB disk lie in the range of $\sim$ 9.7-31.7 kpc in agreement to that found in literature. We study the star formation properties of these simulated double-disk galaxies to understand the distribution of these from blue star-forming to red-quenched region. Some of these double-disk galaxies display a characteristic minima in their (g-r) color radial profiles. The double-disk galaxies are found to lie within $\sim$ 1.5-$\sigma$ region of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation from observation. Our theoretical exploration will be potentially useful in exploring the faint outskirts of massive disk galaxies in upcoming deep surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>Local HI Absorption towards the Magellanic Cloud foreground using ASKAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest Galactic neutral hydrogen HI absorption survey to date, utilizing the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 30''. This survey, GASKAP-HI, unbiasedly targets 2,714 continuum background sources over 250 square degrees in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds, a significant increase compared to a total of 373 sources observed by previous Galactic absorption surveys across the entire Milky Way. We aim to investigate the physical properties of cold (CNM) and warm (WNM) neutral atomic gas in the Milky Way foreground, characterized by two prominent filaments at high Galactic latitudes (between $-45^{\circ}$ and $-25^{\circ}$). We detected strong HI absorption along 462 lines of sight above the 3$\sigma$ threshold, achieving an absorption detection rate of 17%. GASKAP-HI's unprecedented angular resolution allows for simultaneous absorption and emission measurements to sample almost the same gas clouds along a line of sight. A joint Gaussian decomposition is then applied to absorption-emission spectra to provide direct estimates of HI optical depths, temperatures, and column densities for the CNM and WNM components. The thermal properties of CNM components are consistent with those previously observed along a wide range of Solar neighborhood environments, indicating that cold HI properties are widely prevalent throughout the local interstellar medium. Across our region of interest, CNM accounts for ~30% of the total HI gas, with the CNM fraction increasing with column density toward the two filaments. Our analysis reveals an anti-correlation between CNM temperature and its optical depth, which implies that CNM with lower optical depth leads to a higher temperature.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum Leakers at $z&gt;3$ in the GOODS-S Field: Starburst or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star-forming properties of 23 Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers at z &gt; 3 in the Great Observatories' Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S) field based on a systematic review of LyC observations from the literature. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these LyC leakers, covering the spectrum from rest-frame ultraviolet to near-infrared. Through the application of a unified modeling approach, we measure the ultraviolet slope, star formation rate, and stellar mass for these LyC leakers in a consistent manner. These high-redshift LyC leakers demonstrate statistically blue UV-continuum slopes, which is consistent with their high escape fraction of LyC photons. We find that these high-redshift LyC leakers span a wide range of specific star formation rate (log(sSFR/yr) from -8.6 to -6.7). Ten of these LyC leakers are located on the star formation main sequence, instead of all being in the starburst mode. The results indicate that intense bursts of star formation are not necessarily required for the leakage of LyC photons for galaxies at z &gt; 3.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Green Pea Galaxies (IMBH-GP) I: a Candidate Sample from LAMOST and SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling relation of central massive black holes (MBHs) and their host galaxies is well-studied for supermassive BHs (SMBHs, $M_{\rm BH}\ \ge 10^6\, M_{\rm \odot}$). However, this relation has large uncertainties in the mass range of the intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs, $M_{\rm BH}\ \sim10^3-10^{6}\, M_{\rm \odot}$). Since Green Pea (GP) galaxies are luminous compact dwarf galaxies, which may be likely to host less massive SMBHs or even IMBHs, we systematically search for MBHs in a large sample of 2190 GP galaxies at $z &lt; 0.4$, selected from LAMOST and SDSS spectroscopic surveys. Here, we report a newly discovered sample of 59 MBH candidates with broad H$\alpha$ lines. This sample has a median stellar mass of $10^{8.83\pm0.11}\, M_{\rm \odot}$ and hosts MBHs with single-epoch virial masses ranging from $M_{\rm BH}\ \sim 10^{4.7}$ to $10^{8.5}\, M_{\rm \odot}$ (median $10^{5.85\pm0.64}\, M_{\rm \odot}$). Among the 59 MBH candidates, 36 have black hole masses $M_{\rm BH} \le 10^{6}\, M_{\rm \odot}$ (IMBH candidates), one of which even has $M_{\rm BH} \ \lesssim 10^{5}\, M_{\rm \odot}$. We find that the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm *}$ relation of our MBH sample is consistent with the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm bulge}$ relation for SMBHs, while is above the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm *}$ relation for MBHs in dwarf galaxies in the same mass range. Furthermore, we show that 25 MBH candidates, including 4 IMBH candidates, have additional evidence of black hole activities, assessed through various methods such as the broad-line width, BPT diagram, mid-infrared color, X-ray luminosity, and radio emission. Our studies show that it is very promising to find IMBHs in GP galaxies, and the BH sample so obtained enables us to probe the connection between the MBHs and compact dwarf galaxies in the low-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Merging Signatures in an Offset Lyman Continuum Emitter at Redshift 3.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at $z&gt;3$ provide critical samples for studying the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background in the Epoch of Reionization. We collect a sample of $z&gt;3$ LyC emitters, a dominant fraction ($\sim$60%-70%) of which shows spatial offsets between LyC emission and the non-ionizing continuum. From this sample, especially, we find a case of an offset LyC emitter, CDFS-6664 ($z=3.797$), which shows two components in the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images. The exceptionally rich data set of CDFS-6664 enables us to extract the two components across multiple wavelengths and estimate their physical properties. We show that CDFS-6664 is consistent with a major merger system with boosted star formation in both components and the offset LyC emission is most likely associated with the bluer and younger component in this merging system. Our result offers an example in which the offset can be caused by a merger. Future observations of more offset LyC emitters would elucidate the role that mergers play in the escape of LyC photons.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved gas-phase metallicity in Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relations between the gas-phase metallicity radial profiles (few hundred inner parsec) and multiple galaxy properties for 15 Seyfert galaxies from the AGNIFS (Active Galactic Nuclei Integral Field Spectroscopy) sample using optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) processed archival data. The data were selected at $z \lesssim 0.013$ within black hole mass range $\left[6&lt;\log \left(M_{\rm BH}/{\rm M_\odot} \right)&lt;9\right]$ with moderate 14--150\,keV X-ray luminosities $\left[42\,\lesssim\,\log L_X (\rm erg\,s^{-1})\,\lesssim\,44\right]$. We estimated the gas-phase metallicity using the strong-line methods and found mean values for the oxygen dependent ($Z \sim 0.75Z_\odot$) and nitrogen dependent ($Z \sim 1.14Z_\odot$) calibrations. These estimates show excellent agreement with $\Delta Z \approx 0.19$ dex and $\Delta Z \approx 0.18$ dex between the mean values from the two strong-line calibrations for GMOS and MUSE respectively, consistent with the order of metallicity uncertainty via the strong-line methods. We contend that our findings align with a scenario wherein local Seyferts have undergone seamless gas accretion histories, resulting in positive metallicity profile over an extended period of time, thereby providing insights into galaxy evolution and the chemical enrichment or depletion of the universe. Additionally, we argue that metal-poor gas inflow from the local interstellar medium (ISM) and accreted through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) onto the galaxy systems regulates the star formation processes by diluting their central metallicity and inverting their metallicity gradients, producing a more prominent anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and Eddington ratio.</description>

      <title>A physically-motivated template set for high-z galaxy SED fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new physically-motivated spectral template set for fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of high-z galaxies. We use the public galaxy formation code ARES to generate star formation histories of thirteen representative galaxies with diverse masses and generate their predicted spectra across a set of redshifts at z &gt; 6. The model parameters are calibrated to reproduce the properties of z &gt; 6 galaxies observed by HST. Motivated by the apparent importance of bursty star formation at high redshifts, we also include templates with recent starbursts. We use these templates with the SED-fitting code EAZY to analyze both an independent theoretical model and a public sample of JWST-observed galaxies from the JADES survey. The comparison with a semi-analytic model demonstrates that our fitting framework accurately measures the galaxy properties, even when the underlying assumptions of the model differ from ours. Our preliminary application to JWST data shows that galaxies at z &gt; 8 are often bursty (especially at small galaxy masses), follow a star-forming main sequence similar to those at lower redshift (albeit with a higher normalization), and form stars earlier than expected in ares. Our SED-fitting framework is very fast (thanks to the efficiency of EAZY) but provides full inferred star formation histories for each source. Additionally, it enables a direct comparison to theoretical models and helps point toward improvements necessary in those models.</description>

      <title>The eventful life of a luminous galaxy at z = 14: metal enrichment, feedback, and low gas fraction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy so far, at $z&gt;14$. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report the ALMA detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m line emission with a significance of 6.67$\sigma$ and at a frequency of 223.524 GHz, corresponding to a redshift of $14.1796\pm0.0007$, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with a column density of $\log(N_{\rm HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})=22.23$. The total [OIII]88$\mu$m luminosity (log($(L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_\odot) = 8.3\pm0.1$) is fully consistent with the local $L_{\rm [OIII]}-SFR$ relation. Based on the ${L_{\rm [OIII]}/SFR}$, we infer a gas-phase metallicity $&gt;0.1~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$, which is somewhat unexpected given the weakness of the UV emission lines. Using prospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find $Z=0.17~{Z_{\rm \odot}}$ and an escape fraction of ionizing photons of 20%, which is necessary to explain the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007\r{A}/[O III]88$\mu$m line flux ratio between 1 and 10, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 300 cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than those measured in other high-$z$ luminous galaxies. The [OIII]88$\mu$m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of $\log$(M$_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot$) = 9.0$\pm0.2$. This value is comparable to the stellar mass derived from the SED fitting, which implies a very low gas fraction. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m in JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.1793</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure $z &gt; 10$ JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting ($6.6\sigma$) the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of $z=14.1793\pm0.0007$, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of $z=14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ from NIRSpec by $\gtrsim$180$\times$. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection ($3.6\sigma$) of CIII]$_{1907,1909}$ ($z=14.178\pm0.013$), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88} = (2.1 \pm 0.5)\times10^8\,L_\odot$, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}$-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $&lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield $y_d &lt; 0.3\,M_\odot$. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ and H$\beta$ lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched ($Z\sim0.05 - 0.2\,Z_\odot$) a mere $300\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.</description>

      <title>The origin of free-floating objects in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky way Galaxy is brimming with free-floating objects, including stars, planets and planetesimals. For the purpose of this chapter, we define a free-floating object as a solid body that is not orbited by a considerably more massive body. A planet then is considered free floating if it is not orbiting a star but it may be orbiting another planet. A binary planet, or planet-moon pair that is not orbiting a star, is then considered free floating.
  Most free-floating objects are not born as such because most objects form in some sort of coordinated environmental effort, such as a star forming region or a circum-stellar disk. Free-floating stars then originate from dissolved clusters. Free floating planets are ejected from their parent star in an internal dynamical encounter with another planet or stripped from the star by other means such as a supernova or a nearby passing star. Free floating (interstellar) planetesimals probably form in a similar fashion as free-floating planets.
  The number of free-floating objects in the Galaxy can be large. With billions of stars and planets, and trillions of interstellar planetesimals. Although free-floating planets appear to be quite common (a few hundred have been observed), only two interstellar planetesimals have been discovered so far. The expectation, however, is that they outnumber the stars in the Galaxy by a considerable margin. We expect them to be found more frequently once large new instruments come online, such as the Vera Cooper Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Testing the framework of the halo occupation distribution with assembly bias modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretical systematics caused by the application of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to the study of galaxy clustering at non-linear scales. To do this, we repeat recent cosmological analyses using extended HOD models based on both the Aemulus and Aemulus $\nu$ simulation suites, allowing for variations in the dark matter halo shape, incompleteness, baryonic effects and position bias of central galaxies. We fit to the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole, and consider how the changes in HOD affect the retrieval of cosmological information. These extensions can be understood as an evaluation of the impact of the secondary bias in the clustering analysis. In the application of BOSS galaxies, these changes do not have a significant impact on the measured linear growth rate. But, we do find weak to mild evidence for some of the effects modeled by the empirical parameterizations adopted. The modeling is able to make the HOD approach more complete in terms of cosmological constraints. We anticipate that the future and better data can provide tighter constraints on the new prescriptions of the HOD model.</description>

      <title>The impact of third dredge-up on the mass loss of Mira variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The details of the mass-loss process in the late stages of low- and intermediate-mass stellar evolution are not well understood, in particular its dependence on stellar parameters. Mira variables are highly suitable targets for studying this mass-loss process. Aims: We follow up on our earlier finding that a near-to-mid-infrared colour vs. pulsation period diagram shows two sequences of Miras that can be distinguished by the third dredge-up (3DUP) indicator technetium in those stars. While IR colours are good indicators of the dust mass-loss rate (MLR) from Miras, no corresponding sequences have been found using the gas MLR. However, investigations of the gas MLR have been hampered by data limitations. We aim to alleviate these limitations with new observational data. Methods: We present new optical spectra of a well-selected sample of Miras. We searched these spectra for absorption lines of Tc and other 3DUP indicators and combined our findings with gas MLRs and expansion velocities from the literature. Furthermore, we analyse WISE MIR data and compare the broadband SEDs of Miras with and without Tc. Results: We find no systematic difference in gas MLRs between Miras with and without Tc. However, the gas envelopes of Tc-poor Miras appear to have a higher expansion velocity than those of Miras with Tc. Furthermore, our analysis of the IR photometry strongly corroborates the earlier finding that Tc-poor Miras have a higher MIR emission than Tc-rich ones, by as much as a factor of two. We model the IR colours with DARWIN and stationary wind models and conclude that Miras with and without Tc have different dust content or properties. Conclusions: We discuss several hypotheses of the observations and conclude that the reduction of free oxygen by 3DUP of carbon and iron-depleted dust grains in Tc-rich stars are the most convincing explanations for our observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astrophysics with TianQin: A brief progress review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a space-borne gravitational wave observatory, TianQin can observe a large variety of gravitational wave sources. The rich signals can be composed by different types of astronomical systems, like Galactic compact binaries, inspiral of stellar mass black holes, merger of massive black holes, and extreme mass ratio inspirals. The incoherent summation of these signals can also form a stochastic gravitational wave background. Using the future TianQin observation, it is possible to put stringent constraints on fundamental science, like the expansion history of our universe. In this work, we provide a brief review of these topics that contributes to the 7th International Workshop on the TianQin Science Mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the interaction between superfluid dark matter and rotating supermassive black holes offers a promising framework for probing quantum effects in ultralight dark matter and its role in galactic structure. We study how black hole rotation influences the state of ultralight bosonic dark matter, focusing on the stability and dynamics of vortex lines. The gravitational effects of both dark matter and the black hole on the physical properties of these vortex lines, including their precession around the black hole, are analyzed.</description>

      <title>The Dustiest Galactic S Stars: Mid-Infrared Spectra from SOFIA/FORCAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectra of 12 of the reddest, and hence dustiest, S stars in the Milky Way, observed with the FORCAST grisms on SOFIA. S stars are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with C/O$\sim$1, so their molecular and dust chemistries are dominated by neither O nor C, often leading to atypical spectral features from their molecules and dust grains. All of the stars in our sample have strong dust emission features at 10--11 $\mu$m, but the shape of the feature in most of the stars differs from the shapes commonly observed in either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich AGB stars. Two stars also show the 13 $\mu$m feature associated with crystalline alumina. Two have a water absorption band at $\sim$6.5--7.5 $\mu$m, and a third has a tentative detection, but only one of these three has the more common SiO absorption band at 7.5 $\mu$m. Three others show a red 6.3 $\mu$m emission feature from complex hydrocarbons consistent with ``Class C'' objects, and in a fourth it appears at 6.37 $\mu$m, redder than even the standard Class C hydrocarbon feature. Class C spectra typically indicate complex hydrocarbons which have been less processed by UV radiation, resulting in more aliphatic bonds relative to aromatic bonds. None of the S stars shows a strong 11.3 $\mu$m hydrocarbon feature, which is also consistent with the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>A holistic exploration of the potentially recoverable redshift information of Stage IV galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extragalactic science and cosmology with Stage IV galaxy surveys will rely almost exclusively on redshift measurements derived solely from photometry, which are subject to systematic and statistical uncertainties with numerous analysis choices, such as that of an estimator and prior information and no universal solution. Single-survey photometric redshift estimates ought to be improved by combining data from multiple surveys, with common wisdom asserting that optical data benefits from additional infrared coverage but not from additional ultraviolet coverage. The degree of improvement for either case is not well-characterized and attempts to quantify it necessitate assumptions of a chosen estimator and its prior information. We apply an information theoretic metric of potentially recoverable redshift information to assess the impact of multi-survey photometry combinations without assuming an estimator nor priors in the context of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in the optical, Roman and Euclid Surveys in the infrared, and Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR) in the ultraviolet. We conclude that the addition of UV photometry can benefit redshift determination of certain galaxy populations, but that gain is tempered by their decreased chance of meeting detection criteria at higher wavelengths. We explore the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of galaxies whose potentially recoverable redshift information is most impacted by additional photometry to provide a basis for future evaluation of which science cases may motivate which combinations. The holistic assessment approach we develop here is generic and may be applied to quantify the impact of combining photometric datasets, changing experimental design choices, including observing strategy optimization, and evaluating systematics mitigation procedures.</description>

      <title>Refractive lensing of scintillating FRBs by sub-parsec cloudlets in the multi-phase CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the refractive lensing effects of ionized cool ($T \sim 10^4\,{\rm K}$) gas cloudlets in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. In particular, we discuss the combined effects of lensing from these cloudlets and scintillation from plasma screens in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). We show that, if the CGM comprises a mist of sub-parsec cloudlets with column densities of order $10^{17}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ (as predicted by McCourt et al. 2018), then FRBs whose sightlines pass within a virial radius of a CGM halo will may be lensed into tens of refractive images with a $\sim 10\,{\rm ms}$ scattering timescale. When these images are formed, they will be resolved by scintillating screens in the Milky Way ISM, and will suppress the observed scintillation. We illustrate this effect in refractive lensing and argue that positive detections of FRB scintillation may constrain the properties of these cool-gas cloudlets, with current scintillation observation weakly disfavouring the cloudlet model. We propose that sheet-like geometries for the cool gas in the CGM can reconcile quasar absorption measurements (from which we infer the presence of the cool gas with structure on sub-parsec scales) and the unexpected lack of lensing signals from this gas thus far observed.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Improved Narrowband Ly$\alpha$ Emitter Selection Techniques for $z$ = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are typically young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies with little extinction from interstellar dust. Their low dust attenuation allows their Ly$\alpha$ emission to shine brightly in spectroscopic and photometric observations, providing an observational window into the high-redshift universe. Narrowband surveys reveal large, uniform samples of LAEs at specific redshifts that probe large scale structure and the temporal evolution of galaxy properties. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) utilizes three custom-made narrowband filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to discover LAEs at three equally spaced periods in cosmological history. In this paper, we introduce the hybrid-weighted double-broadband continuum estimation technique, which yields improved estimation of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths. Using this method, we discover 6032, 5691, and 4066 LAE candidates at $z =$ 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 in the extended COSMOS field ($\sim$9 deg$^2$). We find that [O II] emitters are a minimal contaminant in our LAE samples, but that interloping Green Pea-like [O III] emitters are important for our redshift 4.5 sample. We introduce an innovative method for identifying [O II] and [O III] emitters via a combination of narrowband excess and galaxy colors, enabling their study as separate classes of objects. We present scaled median stacked SEDs for each galaxy sample, revealing the overall success of our selection methods. We also calculate rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths for our LAE samples and find that the EW distributions are best fit by exponential functions with scale lengths of $w_0$ = 53 $\pm$ 1, 65 $\pm$ 1, and 59 $\pm$ 1 Angstroms, respectively.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by an ellipsoidal Navarro--Frenk--White dark-matter halo: An analytic solution and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of gravitational lensing by galaxies and galaxy clusters typically relies on ellipsoidal lens models to describe the deflection of light by the involved dark-matter halos. These models are most often based on the isothermal density profile -- not an optimal description of the halo, but easy to use because it leads to an analytic deflection-angle formula. Dark-matter halos are better described by the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile. We set out to study lensing by a general triaxial ellipsoidal NFW halo, with the aim of providing an analytic model that would be more consistent with the current understanding of dark-matter halos. We computed the conversion between the properties of a triaxial ellipsoidal lens model and its elliptical surface-density profile. In the case of the NFW lens model, its angular scale is defined by the projected scale semi-major axis of the halo, while its lensing regime depends on two parameters: the projected eccentricity $e$ and the convergence parameter $\kappa_\text{s}$. We employed the Bourassa \&amp; Kantowski formalism to compute the complex scattering function of the model, which yields the deflection-angle components when separated into its real and imaginary parts. We present the obtained closed-form expressions for the deflection-angle components, valid for an arbitrary eccentricity of the surface-density profile. We use them to compute and describe the lensing properties of the model, including: the shear, its components, and the phase; the critical curves, caustics, and the parameter-space mapping of their geometries; the deformations and orientations of images. The analytically solved ellipsoidal NFW lens model is available for implementation in gravitational lensing software. The techniques introduced here such as the image-plane analysis can prove to be useful for understanding the properties of other lens models as well.</description>

Abstract: Morphological features in galaxies, like spiral arms, bars, rings, tidal tails etc. carry information about their structure, origin and evolution. It is therefore important to catalog and study such features and to correlate them with other basic galaxy properties, the environment in which the galaxies are located and their interactions with other galaxies. The volume of present and future data on galaxies is so large that traditional methods, which involve expert astronomers identifying morphological features through visual inspection, are no longer sufficient. It is therefore necessary to use AI based techniques like machine learning and deep learning for finding morphological structures quickly and efficiently. We report in this study the application of deep learning for finding ring like structures in galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release DR18. We use a catalog by Buta (2017) of ringed galaxies from the SDSS to train the network, reaching good accuracy and recall, and generate a catalog of 29420 galaxies of which 4855 have ring like structures with prediction confidence exceeding 90 percent. Using a catalog of barred galaxy images identified by Abraham et. al. (2018) using deep learning techniques, we identify a set of 2087 galaxies with bars as well as rings. The catalog should be very useful in understanding the origin of these important morphological structures. As an example of the usefulness of the catalog, we explore the environments and star formation characteristics of ring galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the first-infall history of the LMC through its dynamical impact in the Milky Way halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational interactions between the LMC and the Milky Way cause dynamical perturbations in the MW halo, leading to biased distributions of stellar density and kinematics. We run 50 high-resolution N-body simulations exploring varying masses and halo shapes of the MW and LMC to study the evolution of LMC-induced perturbations. By measuring mean velocities of simulated halo stars, we identify a discontinuity between the first-infall and second-passage scenarios of the LMC's orbital history. In the first infall, the Galactocentric latitudinal velocity hovers around 16 km/s for stars at 50-100 kpc, while it subsides to about 8 km/s in the second-passage scenario. We demonstrate that this reduced perturbation magnitude in the second-passage scenario is mainly due to the short dynamical times of the Galactic inner halo and the lower velocity of the LMC during its second infall into the MW. Using a subset of $\sim 1100$ RR Lyrae stars located in the outer halo ($50 \leq R_{\mathrm{GC}} &lt; 100$ kpc) with precise distance estimates from Gaia, we find the mean latitudinal velocity ($v_{b}$) in the Galactocentric frame to be $\langle v_{b} \rangle = 18.1 \pm 4.1$ km/s. The observation supports the first-infall scenario with a massive LMC ($\sim 2.1 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) at infall, an oblate MW halo with a virial mass $M_{200} &lt; 1.4 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and a flattening parameter $q &gt; 0.7$. Our study indicates that LMC-induced kinematic disturbances can reveal its orbital history and key characteristics, as well as those of the MW. This approach shows promise in helping determine fundamental parameters of both galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of H alpha luminosity as a star formation tracer in spatially resolved observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the limitations of H$\alpha$ luminosity as a tracer of star formation rates (SFR) in spatially resolved observations. We carry out high-resolution simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy including both supernova and photoionization feedback, and from these we generate synthetic H$\alpha$ emission maps that we compare to maps of the true distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) on scales from whole-galaxy to individual molecular clouds ($\lesssim 100$ pc). Our results reveal significant spatial mismatches between H$\alpha$ and true YSO maps on sub-100 pc scales, primarily due to ionizing photon leakage, with a secondary contribution from young stars drifting away from their parent molecular clouds. On small scales these effect contribute significantly to the observed anti-correlation between gas and star formation, such that there is noticeably less anti-correlation if we replace an H$\alpha$-based star formation map with a YSO-based one; this in turn implies that previous studies have underestimated the time it takes for young stars to disperse their parent molecular clouds. However, these effects are limited in dense regions with hydrogen columns $N_\mathrm{H} &gt; 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, where the H$\alpha$- and YSO-based SFR maps show better agreement. Based on this finding we propose a calibration model that can precisely measure the SFR of large molecular clouds (mean radius &gt; 100 pc) with a combination of H$\alpha$ and CO observations, which provides a foundation for future study of star formation processes in extragalactic molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Low [O/Fe] Ratio in a Luminous Galaxy at the Early Cosmic Epoch ($z&gt;10$): Signature of Short Delay Time or Bright Hypernovae/Pair-Instability Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at $z=10.60$ derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating (G140M, G235M, and G395M) data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and CLOUDY-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking out the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower redshift ($z\sim 2-6$) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio $\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.37^{+0.43}_{-0.22}$, which is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than measured for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$. Because $z=10.60$ is an early epoch after the Big Bang ($\sim 430$ Myr) and the first star formation (likely $\sim 200$ Myr), it is difficult to produce Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) requiring sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short, or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNeIa but bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance, but rather supports the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $10^7$ K hot emitting gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of the $\approx 10^6$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\approx 10^7$ K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the `virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \emph{emission} occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.</description>

      <title>Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.</description>

      <title>CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy. IV. ALMA observations of organic species at Galactocentric radius ~23 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-dish observations suggest that the abundances of organic species in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy, characterised by sub-Solar metallicities, are comparable to those found in the local Galaxy. To understand this counter-intuitive result, and avoid misleading interpretation due to beam dilution effects at such large distances, spatially resolved molecular emission maps are needed to link correctly measured abundances and local physical properties. We observed several organic molecules with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array towards WB89-671, the source with the largest Galactocentric distance (23.4~kpc) of the project "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT), at a resolution of 15000~au. We compared the observed molecular abundances with chemical model predictions. We detected emission of c-C3H2, C4H, CH3OH, H2CO, HCO, H13CO+, HCS+, CS, HN13C, and SO. The emission morphology is complex, extended, and different in each tracer. The most intense emission in H13CO+, H2CO and c-C3H2 arises from two millimeter continuum, infrared-bright cores. The most intense CH3OH and SO emission arises predominantly from the part of the filament with no continuum sources. The narrow linewidths across the filament indicate quiescent gas, despite the two embedded protostars. Derived molecular column densities are comparable with those in local star-forming regions, and suggest anti-correlation between hydrocarbons, ions, HCO, and H2CO on one side, and CH3OH and SO on the other. Static chemical models that best match the observed column densities favour low energetic conditions, expected at large Galactocentric radii, but carbon elemental abundances 3 times higher than that derived extrapolating the [C/H] Galactocentric gradient at 23~kpc. This would indicate a flatter [C/H] trend at large Galactocentric radii, in line with a flat abundance of organics.</description>

      <title>A new measurement of the Galactic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient from sensitive HCO$^+$ absorption observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the Galactic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient with sensitive HCO$^+$ absorption observations against strong continuum sources. The new measurements suffer less from beam dilution, optical depths, and chemical fractionation, allowing us to derive the isotopic ratios precisely. The measured $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in the Solar neighborhood (66$\pm$5) is consistent with those obtained from CH$^+$. Two measurements toward the Galactic Center are 42.2$\pm$1.7 and 37.5$\pm$6.5. Though the values are a factor of 2$\sim$3 higher than those derived from dense gas tracers (e.g., H$_2$CO, complex organic molecules) toward Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 regions, our results are consistent with the absorption measurements from c-C$_3$H$_2$ toward Sgr B2 ($\sim$40), and those from CH$^+$ toward Sgr A$^*$ and Sgr B2(N) ($&gt;$30). We calculate a new Galactic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient of (6.4$\pm$1.9)$R_{\rm GC}$/kpc+(25.9$\pm$10.5), and find an increasing trend of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient obtained from high-density to low-density gas tracers, suggesting opacity effects and chemical fractionation may have a strong impact on the isotopic ratios observed at high-density regions.</description>

      <title>An H{\alpha} view of galaxy build-up in the first 2 Gyr: luminosity functions at z~4-6.5 from NIRCam/grism spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The H{\alpha} nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H{\alpha} emitters at 3.7&lt;z&lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin^2 of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H{\alpha} at 4.9&lt;z&lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin^2 in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H{\alpha} at 3.8&lt;z&lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at $z\sim5.2$ in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H{\alpha} luminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.</description>

      <title>Accurate Computation of the Screening of Scalar Fifth Forces in Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms allow light scalar fields to dynamically avoid the constraints that come from our lack of observation of a long-range fifth force. Galactic scale tests are of particular interest when the light scalar is introduced to explain the dark matter or dark energy that dominates our cosmology. To date, much of the literature that has studied screening in galaxies has described screening using simplifying approximations. In this work, we calculate numerical solutions for scalar fields with screening mechanisms in galactic contexts, and use these to derive new, precise conditions governing where fifth forces are screened. We show that the commonly used binary screened/unscreened threshold can predict a fifth force signal in situations where a fuller treatment does not, leading us to conclude that existing constraints might be significantly overestimated. We show that various other approximations of the screening radius provide a more accurate proxy to screening, although they fail to exactly reproduce the true screening surface in certain regions of parameter space. As a demonstration of our scheme, we apply it to an idealised Milky Way and thus identify the region of parameter space in which the solar system is screened.</description>

      <title>Extracting parity-violating gravitational waves from projected tidal force tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced by various mechanisms in the early universe. In particular, if parity is violated, it may lead to the production of parity-violating GWs. In this paper, we focus on GWs on the scale of the large-scale structure. Since GWs induce tidal deformations of the shape of galaxies, one can extract such GW signals by observing images of galaxies in galaxy surveys. Conventionally the detection of such signals is discussed by considering the three-dimensional power spectra of the $E/B$-modes. Here, we develop a complementary new technique to estimate the contribution of GWs to the tidal force tensor field projected on the celestial sphere, which is a directly observable quantity. We introduce two two-dimensional vector fields constructed by taking the divergence and curl of the projected tidal field in three dimensions. Their auto-correlation functions naturally contain contributions of the scalar-type tidal field. However, we find that the divergence of the curl of the projected tidal field, which is a pseudo-scalar quantity, is free from the scalar contribution and thus enables us to extract GW signals. We also find that we can detect parity-violating signals in the GWs by observing the nonzero cross-correlation between the divergence of the projected tidal field and the curl of it. It roughly corresponds to measuring the cross-power spectrum of E and B-modes, but these are complementary to each other in the sense that our estimator can be naturally defined locally in position space. Finally we present expressions of the correlation functions in the form of Fourier integrals, and discuss the properties of the kernels specific to the GW case, which we call the overlap reduction function, borrowing the terminology used in the pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto and Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of $\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$ roughly holds from $\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The accretion flow on scales $\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($\beta\sim 10^{-3}$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for $r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $\eta\sim0.05-0.1$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $\sim 50$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim (10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of extragalactic point sources on the low-frequency sky spectrum and cosmic dawn global 21-cm measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contribution of resolved and unresolved extragalactic point sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum is a potentially non-negligible part of the astrophysical foregrounds for cosmic dawn 21-cm experiments. The clustering of such point sources on the sky, combined with the frequency-dependence of the antenna beam, can also make this contribution chromatic. By combining low-frequency measurements of the luminosity function and the angular correlation function of extragalactic point sources, we develop a model for the contribution of these sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum. Using this model, we find that the contribution of sources with flux density $&gt;10^{-6}\,$Jy to the sky-averaged spectrum is smooth and of the order of a few kelvins at 50--$200\,$MHz. We combine this model with measurements of the galactic foreground spectrum and weigh the resultant sky by the beam directivity of the conical log-spiral antenna planned as part of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) project. We find that the contribution of point sources to the resultant spectrum is $\sim0.4\%$ of the total foregrounds, but still larger by at least an order of magnitude than the standard predictions for the cosmological 21-cm signal. As a result, not accounting for the point-source contribution leads to a systematic bias in 21-cm signal recovery. We show, however, that in the REACH case, this reconstruction bias can be removed by modelling the point-source contribution as a power law with a running spectral index. We make our code publicly available as a Python package labelled epspy.</description>

      <title>3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.</description>
