      <title>Extraction of Singular Patterns from a Vector Field via Persistent Path Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of singular patterns is a fundamental problem in theoretical and practical domains due to the ability of such patterns to detect the intrinsic characteristics of vector fields. In this study, we propose an approach for extracting singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularity and segment a region of the singular pattern, which is referred to as a singular polygon. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in analyzing the centers and impact areas of tropical cyclones.</description>

      <title>Extracting Manifold Information from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kernel based method is proposed for the construction of signature (defining) functions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The subsets can range from full dimensional manifolds (open subsets) to point clouds (a finite number of points) and include bounded smooth manifolds of any codimension. The interpolation and analysis of point clouds are the main application. Two extreme cases in terms of regularity are considered, where the data set is interpolated by an analytic surface, at the one extreme, and by a H\"older continuous surface, at the other. The signature function can be computed as a linear combination of translated kernels, the coefficients of which are the solution of a finite dimensional linear problem. Once it is obtained, it can be used to estimate the dimension as well as the normal and the curvatures of the interpolated surface. The method is global and does not require explicit knowledge of local neighborhoods or any other structure present in the data set. It admits a variational formulation with a natural ``regularized'' counterpart, that proves to be useful in dealing with data sets corrupted by numerical error or noise. The underlying analytical structure of the approach is presented in general before it is applied to the case of point clouds.</description>

      <title>Larger Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set ${\cal A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors of ${\cal A}$ include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists some $\delta = \delta(p)&gt;0$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k/\log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. The size of the set is optimal up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. We further prove two extensions of this result. In the first, we provide a large set ${\cal A}$ of non-self-orthogonal vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ such that for every two subsets of ${\cal A}$ of size $k+1$ each, some vector of one of the subsets is orthogonal to some vector of the other. In the second extension, every $k+1$ vectors of the produced set ${\cal A}$ include $\ell+1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors for an arbitrary fixed integer $1 \leq \ell \leq k$. The proofs involve probabilistic and spectral arguments and the hypergraph container method.</description>

      <title>Few shot point cloud reconstruction and denoising via learned Guassian splats renderings and fine-tuned diffusion features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for the reconstruction and denoising of point clouds rely on small datasets of 3D shapes. We circumvent the problem by leveraging deep learning methods trained on billions of images. We propose a method to reconstruct point clouds from few images and to denoise point clouds from their rendering by exploiting prior knowledge distilled from image-based deep learning models. To improve reconstruction in constraint settings, we regularize the training of a differentiable renderer with hybrid surface and appearance by introducing semantic consistency supervision. In addition, we propose a pipeline to finetune Stable Diffusion to denoise renderings of noisy point clouds and we demonstrate how these learned filters can be used to remove point cloud noise coming without 3D supervision. We compare our method with DSS and PointRadiance and achieved higher quality 3D reconstruction on the Sketchfab Testset and SCUT Dataset.</description>

      <title>Embeddings and near-neighbor searching with constant additive error for hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an embedding of the Poincar\'e halfspace $H^D$ into a discrete metric space based on a binary tiling of $H^D$, with additive distortion $O(\log D)$. It yields the following results. We show that any subset $P$ of $n$ points in $H^D$ can be embedded into a graph-metric with $2^{O(D)}n$ vertices and edges, and with additive distortion $O(\log D)$. We also show how to construct, for any $k$, an $O(k\log D)$-purely additive spanner of $P$ with $2^{O(D)}n$ Steiner vertices and $2^{O(D)}n \cdot \lambda_k(n)$ edges, where $\lambda_k(n)$ is the $k$th-row inverse Ackermann function. Finally, we show how to construct an approximate Voronoi diagram for $P$ of size $2^{O(D)}n$. It allows us to answer approximate near-neighbor queries in $2^{O(D)}+O(\log n)$ time, with additive error $O(\log D)$. These constructions can be done in $2^{O(D)}n \log n$ time.</description>

      <title>Detection of Small Holes by the Scale-Invariant Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel topological-data-analytical (TDA) method is proposed to distinguish, from noise, small holes surrounded by high-density regions of a probability density function. The proposed method is robust against additive noise and outliers. Traditional TDA tools, like those based on the distance filtration, often struggle to distinguish small features from noise, because both have short persistences. An alternative filtration, called the Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) filtration, is proposed to prolong the persistences of small holes of high-density regions. This is achieved by weighting the distance function by the density in the sense of Bell et al. The concept of distance-to-measure is incorporated to enhance stability and mitigate noise. The persistence-prolonging property and robustness of the proposed filtration are rigorously established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the proposed filtration's utility in identifying small holes.</description>

      <title>From geometry to generating functions: rectangulations and permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We enumerate several classes of pattern-avoiding rectangulations. We establish new bijective links with pattern-avoiding permutations, prove that their generating functions are algebraic, and confirm several conjectures by Merino and M\"utze. We also analyze a new class of rectangulations, called whirls, using a generating tree.</description>
