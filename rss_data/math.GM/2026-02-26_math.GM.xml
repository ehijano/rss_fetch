      <title>Fermatean fuzzy type entropy-based new integrated decision making method with analysis of energy poverty in T\"urkiye application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Income-based poverty indicators are insufficient to fully explain the multifaceted socio-economic issue of energy poverty. The ability of households to obtain and use energy services sustainably is significantly influenced by structural factors like building efficiency, energy prices, climate, and regional disparities. Moreover, the assessment of energy poverty inherently involves uncertainty, vagueness, and subjective judgments, which limit the applicability of classical deterministic evaluation approaches. This paper proposes a novel, integrated MCDM framework based on FFSs to address these issues. To objectively assess the uncertainty present in FF-information, a novel FF-entropy metric is first presented. The proposed entropy employs a nonlinear structure, enabling a more flexible and sensitive representation of fuzziness in complex decision environments. The subjective weights obtained from the FF-PIPRECIA approach are then blended with the entropy-based objective weights. Lastly, options are ranked according to their relative usefulness in relation to ideal and anti-ideal solutions using the FF-MARCOS approach. The proposed framework is applied to the regional evaluation of energy poverty in Turkiye, considering seven geographical regions and six key criteria: income level, energy prices, energy efficiency, building efficiency, climate, and urbanization. Sensitivity analysis, weight perturbation analysis, and entropy-criterion dominance analysis validate the robustness and stability of the suggested model across various parameter settings. For policymakers and practitioners seeking to develop focused, effective, and socially just energy policies amid uncertainty, the proposed method provides a robust, adaptable decision-support tool.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Geometric Obstructions for Fourier Curves Generated by Prime Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar curves defined by finite Fourier series of the form $F_n(t)=\sum_{p\le n} v_p(n!)\, e^{i p t}$, where the frequencies are the prime numbers and $v_p(n!)$ denotes the exponent of the prime $p$ in the factorization of $n!$. We establish several rigorous obstructions to uniform geometric regularity as $n\to\infty$. In particular, we prove that the curve lengths grow without bound, that neither the first nor the second derivatives remain uniformly bounded, and that the diameters grow at least on the order of $n\log\log n$. As a consequence, the covering numbers of the curves satisfy explicit quantitative lower bounds. These results provide a rigorous explanation for the complex geometric behavior observed in numerical investigations of this model.</description>

      <title>The Derived Adelic Cohomology Conjecture for Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel derived cohomological framework for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture for elliptic curves. In our approach, local arithmetic data are encoded in derived sheaves which, when glued via a mapping cone construction, yield an adelic complex. A natural Postnikov filtration on this complex gives rise to a spectral sequence whose first nonzero differential detects the analytic and algebraic rank of the curve. Moreover, the determinant of this differential equals the combination of classical invariants appearing in the BSD formula. We present rigorous constructions of the derived sheaves involved and establish their key properties, including explicit connections to L-functions through cohomological interpretations. Extensive numerical evidence across curves of various ranks, including those with non-trivial Tate-Shafarevich groups, supports these structural predictions. Our framework unifies several existing approaches to the BSD conjecture, providing a cohomological interpretation that explains both the rank equality and the precise formula where previous methods addressed only partial aspects of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Optional intervals event, sequential operation and their applications in physics, computer science and applied mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09471v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algebraic framework for analyzing event execution intervals and sequences, introducing the concept of Optional Intervals Event (OIE) as a core abstraction. The OIE 4-tuple realizes the mapping of real-world events, storing all feasible execution intervals and sub-event relationships. Based on this, two sequential operations are defined: "Complete Sequential Addition" models concurrent events with a certain degree of equal opportunity within a shared time domain, "Complete Sequential Multiplication" models sequential events with a strict order. And the algebraic properties and orbit spaces of these operations are analyzed.
  Addressing the traditional challenge of "simultaneous start", this paper argues that pointwise temporal equality of timestamps is an unattainable ideal due to physical limits of observational precision. Instead, using sequential operation, "simultaneous start" is reformulated as a certain degree of equal opportunity within an equipotential time window, rather than observed instantaneous equality. This paradigm shift emphasizes integrating subjective algebraic structures to move the perspective from passive observation to active constraint-aware planning, providing a more rigorous formal foundation for event scheduling, physical simulation, and computational modeling that can handle inherent observational uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Analysis Of A Long Memory Circular Convolution Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic model, the product of a circulant matrix and a random normal vector, is shown to produce an evolutive long memory time series with a power law spectral density. The distribution of the time series, a beta location scale family of distributions, provides a connection to the unit centered spherical distribution and directional statistics. The eigenanalysis of the deterministic circulant matrix is shown to provide estimates of the discrete Fourier spectral trend, the intrinsic dimension, the probability density shape parameter of the resulting time series, the condition number of the matrix and a principle component analysis. Examples of the R code, used as the constructive exploratory element of the work are given as constructive elements of the paper. The R code may be copied, pastedinto a R editor, and explored.</description>
