      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Emerging Non-Hermitian Topology in a Chiral Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain describing coupled lossy photonic modes, in which time-reversal symmetry is broken by a coherent drive with a uniform phase gradient. We investigate this model by means of a Gaussian variational ansatz and numerically prove that the steady-state solution is stabilized by an inhomogeneous profile of the driving amplitude, which damps out boundary effects. Our calculations unveil a non-equilibrium phase diagram showing low- and high-density phases for photons separated by a phase coexistence region in which the system exhibits the phenomenon of topological amplification and is characterized by a finite non-Hermitian winding number. Our work shows the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases in an interacting model that can be naturally implemented with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Use of Electron Paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to build quantum computers: n-qubit (n=1,2,3,4) Toffoli Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n=1,2,3,4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is not possible with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), that uses nuclear spins as qubits, which do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in KTaO$_3$ Two-Dimensional Electron Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, for example through the application of an external magnetic field or the presence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested that under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures in the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without inversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of a probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a finite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe current. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO$_3$ with different surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a transverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal orientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect. We discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give rise to the same effects.</description>

      <title>Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank-2 spin liquid on breathing pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 $U(1)$ gauge theory, as described by [H. Yan it et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)]. Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong first-order phase transition, out of the R2-U1 spin liquid, but were too noisy for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data, gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the low-temperature ordered phase is a form of hybrid nematic order with emergent $Z_2$ symmetry, which allows for a sub-extensive set of domain walls at zero energy. This complex form of order arises due to a subtle thermal order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative" approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not yielded to human insights alone.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a quantum computer with a Heron superconducting processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum computers can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conflict between trainability and expressibility is a key challenge in variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Resolving this conflict necessitates designing specific quantum neural networks (QNN) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to predict the learnability of QNNs without costly training. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling without actual training on quantum devices. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable QNN architectures for a given problem without training, which can greatly improve the efficiency especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline 30$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer graphene: Fractal patterns and electronic localization properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently synthesized 30$^\circ$ twisted bilayer graphene (30$^\circ$-TBG) systems are unique quasicrystal systems possessing dodecagonal symmetry with graphene's relativistic properties.
  We employ a real-space numerical atomistic framework that respects both the dodecagonal rotational symmetry and the massless Dirac nature of the electrons to describe the local density of states of the system.
  The approach we employ is very efficiency for systems with very large unit cells and does not rely on periodic boundary conditions. These features allow us to address a broad class of multilayer two-dimensional crystal with incommensurate configurations, particularly TBGs. Our results reveal that the 30$^\circ$-TBG electronic spectrum consist of extended states together with a set of localized wave functions. The localized states exhibit fractal patterns consistent with the quasicrystal tiling.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>
