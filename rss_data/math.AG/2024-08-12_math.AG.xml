      <title>An inductive approach to global generation of adjoint series on irregular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to prove the global generation of adjoint linear systems on irregular varieties inductively. For instance, we prove that Fujita's conjecture holds for irregular varieties of dimension $n$ with nef anticanonical bundle, assuming it holds for lower-dimensional varieties and under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Calabi-Yau Topology using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the earliest applications of AI methodologies to pure mathematics and theoretical physics began with the study of Hodge numbers of Calabi-Yau manifolds, the topology type of such manifold also crucially depend on their intersection theory. Continuing the paradigm of machine learning algebraic geometry, we here investigate the triple intersection numbers, focusing on certain divisibility invariants constructed therefrom, using the Inception convolutional neural network. We find $\sim90\%$ accuracies in prediction in a standard fivefold cross-validation, signifying that more sophisticated tasks of identification of manifold topologies can also be performed by machine learning.</description>

      <title>K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a non-Archimedean characterization of K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities, and show that it agrees with the definition originally defined by Collins--Sz\'ekelyhidi. As an application, we show that to test K-semistability, it suffices to test special test configurations. We also show that special test configurations give rise to lc places of torus equivariant bounded complements.</description>

      <title>Classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is the classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities in positive characteristic. As usual, a singularity is called simple or 0-modal if there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of singularities into which the given singularity can deform. The notion of simpleness was introduced by V. I. Arnold and the classification of low modality singularities has become a fundamental task in singularity theory. Simple complex analytic isolated complete intersection singularities (ICIS) were classified by M. Giusti. However, the classification in positive characteristic requires different methods and is much more involved. The final result is nevertheless similar to the classification in characteristic 0 with some additional normal forms in low characteristic. The theoretical results in this paper mainly concern families of ICIS that are formal in the fiber and algebraic in the base (formal deformation theory is not sufficient). In particular, we give a definition of modality in this situation and prove its semicontinuity.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories of rational double points in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic two, three or five, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Hesse derivative on the $j$-invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $j$-invariant of a cubic curve is an isomorphism invariant parameterized by the moduli space of elliptic curves. The Hesse derivative of a curve $V(f)$ given by the homogeneous polynomial $f$ is $V(\mathcal{H}(f))$ where $\mathcal{H}(f)$ is a the determinant of the Hesse matrix of $f$. In this paper, we compute the $j$-invariant of the Hesse derivative of a cubic curve $C$ in terms of the $j$-invariant of $C$, getting a rational function on the Riemann sphere. We then analyze the dynamics of this rational function, and investigate when a cubic curve is isomorphic to its $n$-fold Hesse derivative.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Weaves and Braid Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.06931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study braid varieties, a class of affine algebraic varieties associated to positive braids. Several geometric constructions are presented, including certain torus actions on braid varieties and holomorphic symplectic structures on their respective quotients. We also develop a diagrammatic calculus for correspondences between braid varieties and use these correspondences to obtain interesting stratifications of braid varieties and their quotients. It is shown that the maximal charts of these stratifications are exponential Darboux charts for the holomorphic symplectic structures, and we relate these strata to exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian links.</description>

      <title>Gorensteinness for normal tangent cones of elliptic ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a two-dimensional excellent normal Gorenstein local domain. In this paper, we characterize elliptic ideals $I \subset A$ for its normal tangent cone $\overline{G}(I)$ to be Gorenstein. Moreover, we classify all those ideals in a Gorenstein elliptic singularity in the characteristic zero case.</description>

      <title>Ogg's Torsion conjecture: Fifty years later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andrew Ogg's mathematical viewpoint has inspired an increasingly broad array of results and conjectures. His results and conjectures have earmarked fruitful turning points in our subject, and his influence has been such a gift to all of us.
  Ogg's celebrated Torsion Conjecture -- as it relates to modular curves -- can be paraphrased as saying that rational points (on the modular curves that parametrize torsion points on elliptic curves) exist if and only if there is a good geometric reason for them to exist.
  We give a survey of Ogg's Torsion Conjecture and the subsequent developments in our understanding of rational points on modular curves over the last fifty years.</description>
