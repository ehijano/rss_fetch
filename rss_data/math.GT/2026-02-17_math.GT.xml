      <title>Exotic 4-manifolds and Khovanov-Lipshitz-Sarkar homotopy type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new diffeomorphism invariant of smooth compact oriented 4-manifolds $X$ with a framed oriented 1-link $L$ in the boundary, where $L$ may be the empty set, and
  call it {\it Khovanov-Lipshitz-Sarkar skein lasagna homotopy type} or {\it KLS lasagna homotopy type} $\mathcal E^{{LS}}_0(X,L)$. Our invariant assigns to a smooth structure a stable homotopy type of a CW complex.
  Our new invariant is not weaker than KR lasagna module, which were defined by Morrison, Walker and Wedrich.
  For a pair $(X,L)$ such that $L\neq\emptyset$, our new invariant, KLS lasagna homotopy type, is stronger than the Khovanov-Rozansky $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ skein lasagna modules or KR lasagna modules.</description>

      <title>A symmetric monoidal Frohman-Nicas TQFT for sutured manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the decategorification of bordered sutured Heegaard Floer homology, we reinterpret and generalize the classical Frohman-Nicas TQFT for the Alexander polynomial in the setting of 3d sutured cobordisms between sutured surfaces. In this setting, the Frohman-Nicas TQFT maps for arbitrary cobordisms between surfaces, with no connectivity restrictions, get interpreted as part of an honest symmetric monoidal functor (under disjoint union) with no half-projectivity zeroes. We also relate the decategorified bordered sutured theory with $\mathrm{Spin}^c$ structures to a sutured version of Florens-Massuyeau's $G$-analogue of the Frohman-Nicas TQFT.</description>

      <title>Four-page index and linear upper bounds for ribbonlength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the four-page index of a knot or link as a presentation invariant arising from embeddings in a four-page open book decomposition. Using spanning trees of the checkerboard graph of a reduced non-split diagram, we construct a Kauffman state consisting of a single state circle. The associated Eulerian tour of the underlying 4-valent plane graph determines a binding circle intersecting each edge exactly once, producing a four-page presentation with at most $2c(K)$ arcs. Hence $$ \alpha_4(K) \le 2c(K), $$ with strict inequality in the non-alternating case.
  We further prove that ribbonlength is bounded above by the four-page index, and therefore obtain the linear bound $$ \mathrm{Rib}(K) \le 2c(K). $$ This improves the previously known general linear upper bound for ribbonlength and provides a diagrammatic method for estimating ribbonlength.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing diffeomorphism types of relative trisections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish diffeomorphism types of relative trisections using a ``capping'' operation, which yields a trisection diagram of a closed 4-manifold from a relative trisection diagram. Using this operation, we give various examples of non-diffeomorphic relative trisections of the same 4-manifold with boundary. We also study how the corresponding trisected 4-manifold changes under the capping operation.</description>

      <title>Uniform Perfectness, Geodesic Richness, and Rigidity for Sublinearly Morse Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Han and Liu gave a geometric characterization of uniform perfectness for the Morse boundary of a proper geodesic metric space: the Morse boundary is uniformly perfect if and only if the space is Morse geodesically rich, equivalently center--exhaustive. In this paper we prove the analogous statement for the sublinearly Morse boundary $\partial_{\kappa}X$. Here $\kappa$ is a fixed concave increasing sublinear function and $\partial_{\kappa}X$ is the boundary introduced by Qing--Rafi for CAT(0) spaces and extended by Qing--Rafi--Tiozzo to proper geodesic spaces.
  Assuming that $\partial_{\kappa}X$ has at least three points, we show that uniform perfectness of $\partial_{\kappa}X$ (for any $\kappa$--visual metric based at a fixed basepoint) is equivalent to $\kappa$--Morse geodesic richness and to $\kappa$--center--exhaustiveness. The geometric input is a sublinear thin--triangle statement for $\kappa$--Morse geodesics, together with the renormalization map $\rho_{\kappa}(t)=\int_0^t \frac{ds}{\kappa(s)}$, which converts $\kappa$--scale errors at radius $R$ into bounded errors in the $\rho_\kappa$--scale.
  As applications we obtain quantitative lower bounds on the lower Assouad dimension (and, under doubling hypotheses, on the Hausdorff dimension) of $\kappa$--visual metrics on $\partial_{\kappa}X$ in terms of the uniform perfectness constant. Finally, for $\kappa$--center--exhaustive spaces $X$ and $Y$ satisfying a mild additional growth condition on $\kappa$, we prove a rigidity statement in the sublinear category: every quasi-symmetric homeomorphism $\partial_{\kappa}X\to\partial_{\kappa}Y$ is induced by a sublinear bilipschitz equivalence $X\to Y$.</description>

      <title>Flexible Surfaces in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ and $S^2\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surface $\Sigma$ in a 4-manifold $M$ is called flexible if any mapping class of the surface arises as the restriction of a diffeomorphism $(M,\Sigma) \to (M,\Sigma)$. We construct flexible surfaces in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ and $S^2 \times S^2$ within any prescribed non-characteristic homology class. Within characteristic homology classes there is a spin structure obstructing flexibility and we construct so-called spin-flexible representatives.</description>

      <title>A formula for the Euler class of foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a cooriented branched surface $\mathcal B$ fully carrying a foliation $\mathcal F$, we use the dual graph of $\mathcal B$ to define a simplicial 1-cycle $\Gamma(\mathcal B)$ representing the Poincar\'e dual of the Euler class of $\mathcal F$. This construction provides an effective way to track how the Euler class of a foliation carried by a hierarchy changes when the orientation of a decomposing disk is reversed. We also show how our formula generalises previous results of Lackenby and Dunfield.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer Surgery Formula and Cosmetic Surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two Dehn surgeries on a knot are called cosmetic if they yield homeomorphic three-manifolds. We show for a certain family of null-homologous knots in any closed orientable three-manifold, if the knot admits cosmetic surgeries with a pair of positive surgery coefficients, then the coefficients are both greater than $1$. In addition, for this family of knots, we show that $1/q$ Dehn surgery for $q$ at least $2$ is not homeomorphic to the original three-manifold. The proofs of these results use the mapping cone formula for the Heegaard Floer homology of Dehn surgery in terms of the knot Floer homology of the knot; we provide a new proof of this formula for integer surgeries in $\text{Spin}^c$ structures with nontorsion first Chern class.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We give several applications of this procedure, which produced results concerning embeddings of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s, or embeddings of lens spaces as a hypersurface of contact type, in small rational surfaces such as $CP^2\#\overline{CP^2}$ and $S^2\times S^2$, as well as results on the uniqueness or classification of certain symplectic fillings by a $Q$-homology $4$-ball. Further work on the classification of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s is suggested. Moreover, our investigation on the $S^1$-invariant contact structures suggests an interesting and fairly strong upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair $(p,q)$ in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the values $p,q$), and for the symplectic version, we prove the existence of an ``optimal" symplectic rational unicuspidal curve in a rational $4$-manifold which realizes the upper bound for any given Puiseux pair $(p,q)$. Our results also suggest a revisit of the ``symplectic divisorial capping" problem first considered by Li and Mak. Further applications of the techniques developed in this paper hinge upon better understandings for the tightness and fillability criterions of $S^1$-invariant contact structures as well as their (small) symplectic fillings.</description>

      <title>Minimal rational graphs admitting a QHD smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the picture deformation technique of De Jong-Van Straten we show that no singularity whose resolution graph has 3 or 4 large nodes, i.e., nodes satisfying d(v)+e(v)\leq -2, has a QHD smoothing. This is achieved by providing a general reduction algorithm for graphs with QHD smoothings, and enumeration. New examples and families are presented, which admit a combinatorial QHD smoothing, i.e. the incidence relations for a sandwich presentation can be satisfied. We also give a new proof of the Bhupal-Stipsicz theorem on the classification of weighted homogeneous singularities admitting QHD smoothings with this method by using cusp singularities.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic flows on flat vector bundles with an application to complete affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k &lt; n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, $\rho$ has some singular values of subexponential growth in terms of word length. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show that the equivalence holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold, and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>On the growth of torsion in the cohomology of some arithmetic groups of $\mathbb{Q}$-rank one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a number field $F$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{F}$, one can associate to any torsion free subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathcal{O}_{F})$ of finite index a complete Riemannian manifold of finite volume with fibered cusp ends. For natural choices of flat vector bundles on such a manifold, we show that analytic torsion is identified with the Reidemeister torsion of the Borel-Serre compactification. This is used to obtain exponential growth of torsion in the cohomology for sequences of congruence subgroups.</description>
