      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <title>Path-Dependent Energy Lagrangian for Irreversible Thermomechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal Path-Dependent Energy Lagrangian (PDEL) that generates, from a single action, the balance equations of mechanics and the entropy/heat equation for irreversible thermomechanical systems. The reversible part is the Helmholtz free energy, while irreversible effects enter through a history integral of channel powers. A single upper-limit/tangential variation rule makes the same instantaneous power appear as a dissipative force in the mechanical/internal-variable equations and as a positive source in the entropy/heat equation, closing the first law without double counting and guaranteeing nonnegative entropy production under mild monotonicity assumptions. PDEL preserves the classical Lagrangian mechanics while subsuming standard dissipative models (Kelvin--Voigt viscosity, diffusion) and their viscous heating, and clarifies the reversible character of thermo-mechanical cross terms. The formulation offers a compact alternative to Rayleigh/Onsager appendices and GENERIC/metriplectic brackets, with limited algebraic complexity and straightforward extension to multiphysics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Acoustic Kerker Effect in Labyrinthine Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the directionality of the acoustic scattering with single acoustic metaatoms has a key importance for reaching spatial routing of sound with acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we present the experimental demonstration of the acoustic analogue of the Kerker effect realized in a two-dimensional coiled-space metaatom. By engineering the interference between monopolar and dipolar resonances within a high-index acoustic metaatom, we achieve directional scattering with suppressed backward or forward response at the first and second Kerker conditions respectively. Experimental measurements of the scattered pressure field, in a parallel-plate waveguide environment, show good agreement with the full-wave simulations. Our results validate the feasibility of Kerker-inspired wave control in acoustic systems and open new opportunities for directional sound manipulation.</description>

      <title>A solvable microscopic model for the propagation of light in a dielectric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations resemble Schr\"odinger's equation in that an exact solution for a well-defined model delivers all physically relevant details. Solvable microscopic electrodynamic models, however, are rare. An exception is the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which models a medium as a lattice of point dipoles. We use a regularized DDA variant to examine mechanical and electromagnetic momentum of light signals in such a medium in detail. The results agree in essential parts with that of the theory of R. Peierls from 1976.</description>

      <title>Closing a catenary loop: the lariat chain, the string shooter, and the heavy elastica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review, critique, and extend results related to the problem of closed loop shape equilibria of a string shooter, a type of catenary consisting of steady, axially moving configurations of an inertial, inextensible, perfectly flexible string in the presence of gravity and drag forces. We highlight recurring misconceptions, and relate to similar problems, including the lariat (no gravity), chain fountain (not closed), and heavy \emph{elastica} (bending stiffness). We focus on the difficulty inherent to continuing a catenary through a vertical orientation, necessary to close a loop, which difficulty changes in nature as the system undergoes bifurcations with increasing drag. We construct solutions by implementing available analytical results, and numerically generate additional solutions with added bending stiffness. We briefly discuss global balances of linear, angular, and pseudo-momentum for this system.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Electromagnetic Memory Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.</description>
