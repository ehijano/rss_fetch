      <title>Discovery of a low-density filled-ice phase in nitrogen hydrate at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We map the high-pressure phase diagram of nitrogen hydrate up to 16 GPa at room temperature by combining neutron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and crystal structure prediction. We reveal a rich sequence of structural transformations, from sI/sII clathrates to hexagonal (sH) and tetragonal (sT) phases, culminating in a previously unknown orthorhombic filled-ice structure above 1.8 GPa in the Pnma space group, which we designate as NH-V. This new phase cannot be indexed to any known ice frameworks - such as the high-pressure methane hydrates MH-III (Imma) or MH-IV (Pmcn) - and exhibits a density approximately 30% lower than that of stable ice VII, pointing to distinctive water-nitrogen interactions. Our results refine the understanding of nitrogen hydrate behavior under extreme conditions and demonstrate the propensity of nitrogen and water to form stable filled-ice structures up to 16 GPa, with important implications for planetary science.</description>

      <title>Optical phonons as a testing ground for spin group symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations are highly sensitive to crystal symmetries and their changes across phase transitions. The latter can modify irreducible (co)representations and corresponding infrared and Raman selection rules of phonons. This concept is established for relativistic magnetic point groups, simultaneously transforming spatial and spin coordinates. However, in altermagnets described by non-relativistic spin groups with disjunct symmetry operations for both vector spaces, the phonon selection rules have remained unexplored. Here, we present a detailed study of the infrared- and Raman-active modes in the collinear antiferromagnet and altermagnet candidate Co$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Comparing to ab initio calculations accurately capturing the eigenfrequencies, we identify all expected phonon modes at room temperature and deduce their selection rules using both symmetry approaches. Importantly, we observe the change of selection rules upon antiferromagnetic ordering, agreeing with the relativistic symmetry approach, while the spin group formalism predicts no changes. Therefore, optical phonons can reveal the appropriate symmetry treatment.</description>

      <title>Stability of stationary solutions in Acoustic wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions. In particular, we show that the stability of these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Analytic bulk-edge connection in circular-symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations. Our analytic approach is compared with the topological bulk-edge correspondence, which is based on the Chern number of the bulk.</description>

      <title>Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</description>
