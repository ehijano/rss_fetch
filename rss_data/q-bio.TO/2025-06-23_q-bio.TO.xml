      <title>Development and in vitro Characterization of a Novel Bioactive Hydrogel for Bioprinting Uterine Constructs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Aim: Decellularized uterine extracellular matrix (dUECM) offers a promising bioactive scaffold for uterine tissue engineering, but its application in 3D constructs has been limited by fabrication challenges. This study aimed to develop a printable, bioactive hydrogel from dUECM suitable for 3D bioprinting and to evaluate its ability to support human uterine myometrial cell growth in vitro.
  Materials and Methods: Porcine uterine tissues were decellularized using 1 percent Triton X-100 and 0.1 to 1.5 percent SDS for 48 to 72 hours. The resulting dUECM was assessed via histology, DNA and GAG quantification, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Selected dUECM samples were digested with pepsin and blended with 2 or 3 percent alginate to create bioinks. Constructs were printed using extrusion-based bioprinting and evaluated for swelling, degradation, mechanical properties, and printability. Biocompatibility was tested by seeding hTERT-HM cells onto cast hydrogels and performing MTT and Live/Dead assays over seven days.
  Results: The optimal protocol (1 percent Triton X-100 and 1 percent SDS for 48 hours) reduced DNA to 51.3 ng per mg, while retaining 54.9 micrograms per mg of GAGs. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed collagen preservation, while thermal stability was moderately reduced. The 3 percent alginate with 1.5 percent dUECM formulation showed superior printability, swelling stability, degradation resistance, and mechanical strength. Cell proliferation reached 258 percent by day 7, significantly outperforming alginate alone.
  Conclusion: The optimized dUECM hydrogel supports printability, mechanical performance, and cell viability, offering a robust platform for uterine tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Design of Bicuspidization of the Aortic Valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Severe congenital aortic valve pathology in the growing patient remains a challenging clinical scenario. Bicuspidization of the diseased aortic valve has proven to be a promising repair technique with acceptable durability. However, most understanding of the procedure is empirical and retrospective. This work seeks to design the optimal gross morphology associated with surgical bicuspidization with simulations, based on the hypothesis that modifications to the free edge length cause or relieve stenosis.
  Methods: Model bicuspid valves were constructed with varying free edge lengths and gross morphology. Fluid-structure interaction simulations were conducted in a single patient-specific model geometry. The models were evaluated for primary targets of stenosis and regurgitation. Secondary targets were assessed and included qualitative hemodynamics, geometric height, effective height, orifice area and billow.
  Results: Stenosis decreased with increasing free edge length and was pronounced with free edge length $\leq$1.3 times the annular diameter d. With free edge length 1.5d or greater, no stenosis occurred. All models were free of regurgitation. Substantial billow occurred with free edge length $\geq$1.7d.
  Conclusions: Free edge length $\geq$1.5d was required to avoid aortic stenosis in simulations. Cases with free edge length $\geq$1.7d showed excessive billow and other changes in gross morphology. Cases with free edge length 1.5-1.6d have a total free edge length approximately equal to the annular circumference and appeared optimal. These effects should be studied in vitro and in animal studies.</description>

      <title>A Fluid-Structure Interaction Model of the Zebrafish Aortic Valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18056</link>

Abstract: The zebrafish is a valuable model organism for studying cardiac development and diseases due to its many shared aspects of genetics and anatomy with humans and ease of experimental manipulations. Computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations are an efficient and highly controllable means to study the function of cardiac valves in development and diseases. Due to their small scales, little is known about the mechanical properties of zebrafish cardiac valves, limiting existing computational studies of zebrafish valves and their interaction with blood. To circumvent these limitations, we took a largely first-principles approach called design-based elasticity that allows us to derive valve geometry, fiber orientation and material properties. In FSI simulations of an adult zebrafish aortic valve, these models produce realistic flow rates when driven by physiological pressures and demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of valvular mechanical properties. These models can be used for future studies of zebrafish cardiac hemodynamics, development, and disease.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation as a Resilience Mechanism in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an increasingly important role in not only understanding the impact of various approaches to treatment on tumour growth, but in optimizing dosing regimens and aiding the development of treatment strategies. However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport.</description>
