      <title>Stochastic modelling reveals that chromatin folding buffers epigenetic landscapes against sirtuin depletion during DNA damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epigenetic landscapes, represented by patterns of chemical modifications on histone tails, are essential for maintaining cell identity and tissue homeostasis. These landscapes are shaped by multiple factors, including local biochemical signals and the three-dimensional organisation of chromatin. However, their response to genomic stress, such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), remains incompletely understood. Here, we use a stochastic model of histone modification dynamics integrated with chromatin architecture to investigate how local depletion of sirtuins, histone deacetylases involved in DSB repair, destabilises epigenetic patterns. Our simulations recapitulate experimental findings in which sirtuin relocalisation to DSB sites leads to the epigenetic erosion and suggest that the resulting landscape depends on enzyme levels and chromatin geometry. Importantly, chromatin regions with large domains of long-range contacts are more resilient to epigenetic destabilisation. These findings suggest that chromatin folding can buffer against relocation of histone-modifying enzymes, highlighting a structural mechanism for preserving epigenetic integrity under stress.</description>

      <title>Simulating stochastic population dynamics: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Objective comparison of methods to decode anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations from Brownian motion leading to anomalous diffusion are found in transport dynamics from quantum physics to life sciences. The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.</description>
