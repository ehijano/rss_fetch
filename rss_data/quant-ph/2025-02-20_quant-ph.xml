      <title>Large Language Models Can Help Mitigate Barren Plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for various applications, yet their training is often hindered by barren plateaus (BPs), where gradient variance vanishes exponentially as the model size increases. To address this challenge, we propose a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven search framework, AdaInit, that iteratively searches for optimal initial parameters of QNNs to maximize gradient variance and therefore mitigate BPs. Unlike conventional one-time initialization methods, AdaInit dynamically refines QNN's initialization using LLMs with adaptive prompting. Theoretical analysis of the Expected Improvement (EI) proves a supremum for the search, ensuring this process can eventually identify the optimal initial parameter of the QNN. Extensive experiments across four public datasets demonstrate that AdaInit significantly enhances QNN's trainability compared to classic initialization methods, validating its effectiveness in mitigating BPs.</description>

      <title>Conditional Mutual Information and Information-Theoretic Phases of Decohered Gibbs States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and quantum Markov networks -- including Gibbs states of commuting local Hamiltonians -- are characterized by the vanishing of conditional mutual information (CMI) between spatially separated subsystems. Adding local dissipation to a Markov network turns it into a \emph{hidden Markov network}, in which CMI is not guaranteed to vanish even at long distances. The onset of long-range CMI corresponds to an information-theoretic mixed-state phase transition, with far-ranging implications for teleportation, decoding, and state compressions. Little is known, however, about the conditions under which dissipation can generate long-range CMI. In this work we provide the first rigorous results in this direction. We establish that CMI in high-temperature Gibbs states subject to local dissipation decays exponentially, (i) for classical Hamiltonians subject to arbitrary local transition matrices, and (ii) for commuting local Hamiltonians subject to unital channels that obey certain mild restrictions. Conversely, we show that low-temperature hidden Markov networks can sustain long-range CMI. Our results establish the existence of finite-temperature information-theoretic phase transitions even in models that have no finite-temperature thermodynamic phase transitions. We also show several applications in quantum information and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using concepts from quantum cryptography, we show how entanglement in many-body mixed states is reflected in standard correlation functions. Focusing on systems in thermal equilibrium with an environment, we ask whether the entanglement in the system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment. Since private keys cannot be generated using separable states, we can infer the presence of entanglement from the success of such protocols. We derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Geometry from quantum temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show how Euclidean 3-space uniquely emerges from the structure of quantum temporal correlations associated with sequential measurements of Pauli observables on a single qubit. Quite remarkably, the quantum temporal correlations which give rise to geometry are independent of the initial state of the qubit, which we show enables an observer to extract geometric data from sequential measurements without the observer having any knowledge of initial conditions. Such results suggest the plausibility that space itself may emerge from quantum temporal correlations, and we formulate a toy model of such a hypothetical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Device-Independent Certification of Schmidt Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers have been shown to outperform those with lower Schmidt numbers in various information processing tasks. Therefore, to ensure the efficient use of resources in these tasks, it is essential to certify the Schmidt number of the resource states. Ideally, this certification should rely as little as possible on the certifying devices, ensuring robustness against potential imperfections. In this work, we explore the scope of fully and partially device-independent Schmidt number certification methods. We demonstrate the general impossibility of fully device-independent certification for all states. Specifically, in a restricted setting, we present a class of states with Schmidt number 3, for which it is impossible to certify that their Schmidt number is greater than 2. However, we show that the Schmidt number of all states can be certified in a measurement-device-independent manner via semi-quantum nonlocal games, which assume trust in the preparation devices. Finally, we present an explicit construction of a semi-quantum game for the measurement-device-independent certification of a class of states.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Global Driving of Trapped Ions for Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $N-$body interactions between any subset $N$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise spectroscopy by qudit spectators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise spectroscopy is a well-known method for detecting environmental noise spectrum and has various applications in quantum sensing, quantum network design, and quantum computing. In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy by qudit spectators (arbitrary d-level quantum systems) is presented for noises with stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting Z-type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit (d=3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad (d=4) and a quoct (d=8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ-dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct (d=8) implemented by the Antimony atom. The analytical protocol for noise spectroscopy that has been introduced transforms qudit systems into quantum spectators, and the presented simulations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this noise spectroscopy protocol.</description>

      <title>Searching Axion-like Dark Matter by Amplifying Weak Magnetic Field with Quantum Zeno effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles, facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark matter and exotic interactions in the near future.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) describes the nonanalytical change of the entanglement entropy resulting from the interplay between measurement and unitary evolution. In this paper, we investigate the relaxation critical dynamics near the MIPT for different initial states in a one-dimensional quantum circuit. Specifically, when the initial state is in the volume-law phase with vanishing measurement probability, we find that the half-chain entanglement entropy $S$ decays as $S\propto t^{-1}$ with the coefficients proportional to the size of the system in the short-time stage; In contrast, when the initial state is the product state, $S$ increases with time as $S\propto \ln{t}$, consistent with previous studies. Despite these contrasting behaviors, we develop a unified scaling form to describe these scaling behaviors for different initial states where the off-critical-point effects can also be incorporated. This framework offers significant advantages for experimental MIPT detection. Our novel scheme, leveraging relaxation dynamical scaling, drastically reduces post-selection overhead, and can eliminate it completely with trackable classical simulation.</description>

      <title>Does there exist a quantum fingerprinting protocol without coherent measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buhrman, Cleve, Watrous, and de Wolf (PRL 2001) discovered the quantum fingerprinting protocol, which is the quantum SMP protocol with $O(\log n)$ qubits communication for the equality problem. In the protocol, Alice and Bob create some quantum fingerprints of their inputs, and the referee conducts the SWAP tests for the quantum fingerprints. Since $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ bits communication is required with the classical SMP scheme for the equality problem first shown by Newman and Szegedy (STOC 1996), there exists an exponential quantum advantage in the amount of communication.
  In this paper, we consider a setting in which the referee can do only incoherent measurements rather than coherent measurements including the SWAP tests. We first show that, in the case of one-way LOCC measurements, $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ qubits communication is required. To prove the result, we derive a new method to replace quantum messages by classical messages and consider a reduction to the optimal lower bound in the hybrid SMP model where one message is quantum and the other is classical, which was first shown by Klauck and Podder (MFCS 2014). Our method uses the result of Oszmaniec, Guerini, Wittek, and Ac\'in (PRL 2017), who showed that general POVM measurements can be simulated by randomized projective measurements with small ancilla qubits, and Newman's theorem.
  We further investigate the setting of quantum SMP protocols with two-way LOCC measurements, and derive a lower bound against some restricted two-way LOCC measurements. To prove it, we revisit the technique to replace quantum messages by classical deterministic messages introduced by Aaronson (ToC 2005) and generalized by Gavinsky, Regev, and de Wolf (CJTCS 2008), and show that, using the deterministic message, the referee can simulate the two-way LOCC measurements.</description>

      <title>Beam splitters as controlled-Z gate for hybrid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a scheme based on adding a nonlocal photon and subtracting some number of photons to entangle the initial single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state with the photon state. In a realistic model of interaction of the SMSV state with the photonic state on a beam splitter (BS) with changeable transmissivity or reflectivity the hybrid entanglement is realized for any values of the squeezing of input SMSV state. Maximum hybrid entanglement is achieved at certain values of the squeezing and BS parameter, which can mean implementation of a two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ-) operation using the BS with the appropriate initialization of the input states. The success probability of the gate, taking into account multiphoton outcomes in the measuring mode of the BS, is more than 0.3. We also propose to use new continuous variable (CV) states of definite parity that could increase the success probability of generating maximal hybrid entanglement. We show sufficient robustness of the generated entanglement under photon number resolving detection with practical quantum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Coherence analysis of phase-controlled HOM effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order intensity correlation of entangled photons has been intensively studied for decades, particularly for the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect and nonlocal correlation -- key quantum phenomena that have no classical counterparts. Recently, a path-entangled two-photon state has been experimentally demonstrated for both bosonic (symmetric) and fermionic (anti-symmetric) HOM effects by manipulating the photon phase at one input port. Entanglement represents a quantum superposition of path- or energy-correlated two-photon states with a relative phase. According to the conventional quantum mechanics, this phase is not an individual property but collective attribute of interacting photons. Here, the wave nature of photons is employed to coherently analyze the phase-controlled HOM effects recently observed in npj Quantum Info. 5, 43 (2019). A pure coherence approach is applied to derive a general solution for these phase-controlled HOM effects. Consequently, the quantum mystery of HOM effects, traditionally interpreted through the particle nature of quantum mechanics, is revealed as a coherent phenomenon between entangled photons via a selective choice of correlated photons.</description>

      <title>On-demand storing time-bin qubit states with optical quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory, serving as a crucial device for storing and releasing quantum states, holds significant importance in long-distance quantum communications. Up to date, quantum memories have been realized in many different systems. However, most of them have complex structures and high costs. Besides, it is not easy to simultaneously achieve both high storage efficiency and fidelity. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a low-cost optical quantum memory with high efficiency and high fidelity, by utilizing a butterfly shaped cavity consisting of one polarization beam splitter, two reflecting mirrors and one pockels cell crystal. In order to quantify the quality of the quantum memory, we carry out tomography measurements on the time-bin qubits encoded with weak coherent states after storage for N rounds. The storage efficiency per round can reach up to 95.0\%, and the overall state fidelity can exceed 99.1\%. It thus seems very promising for practical implementation in quantum communication and networks.</description>

      <title>Solving the Encoding Bottleneck: Of the HHL Algorithm, By the HHL Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers exponential speedup for solving the quantum linear-system problem. But some caveats for the speedup could be hard to met. One of the difficulties is the encoding bottleneck, i.e., the efficient preparation of the initial quantum state. To prepare an arbitrary $N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally require a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm. Here we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of $O(poly(\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm itself. Thus, applying this approach to prepare the initial state of the original HHL algorithm can preserve the exponential speedup advantage. It can also serve as a standalone solution for other applications demanding rapid state preparation.</description>

      <title>Tweezer-assisted subwavelength positioning of atomic arrays in an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental technique that enables the preparation of defect-free arrays of 87Rb atoms within a microscopic high-finesse optical standing-wave cavity. By employing optical tweezers, we demonstrate atom positioning with a precision well below the cavity wavelength, a crucial requirement for cavity-QED experiments in which maximum atom-cavity coupling strength is required. We leverage our control capabilities to assemble an array of up to seven atoms with an efficiency that exceeds previous probabilistic methods by 4 orders of magnitude. The atoms are subsequently transferred from the tweezer array to a two-dimensional intracavity optical lattice that offers enhanced coherence for spin qubits while maintaining strong atom confinement. Our system overcomes the efficiency limitations of previous probabilistic loading techniques of cavity-coupled atom arrays and opens the path to multiqubit quantum networks with atoms strongly coupled to optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Models of liquid samples confinement for nanoscale NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion is a prominent source of noise affecting nuclear magnetic resonance at the nanometer scale (nano-NMR), preventing high resolution studies of unpolarized liquid samples. Actively managing diffusion noise through, for example, sample confinement, is likely to unveil alternative noise sources which so far have been disregarded, as they occur in longer time-scales and are, consequently, masked by diffusion. These secondary noise sources could diminish the advantages provided by sample confinement but, on the other hand, they can provide with valuable information about the behavior of the sample and its interactions. In this article, we study for the first time and in detail two noise models for confined nano-NMR, namely, surface interactions and porosity, and discuss their implications for typical nano-NMR experiments.</description>

      <title>Polarization tensor in spacetime of three dimensions and quantum field theoretical description of the nonequilibrium Casimir force in graphene systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization tensor of graphene derived in the framework of the Dirac model using the methods of thermal quantum field theory in (2+1) dimensions is recast in a mathematically equivalent but more compact and convenient in computations form along the real frequency axis. The obtained unified expressions for the components of the polarization tensor are equally applicable in the regions of the on- and off-the-mass-shell electromagnetic waves. The advantages of the presented formalism are demonstrated on the example of nonequilibrium Casimir force in the configuration of two parallel graphene-coated dielectric plates one of which is either hotter or colder than the environment. This force is investigated as a function of temperature, the energy gap, and chemical potential of graphene coatings with account of the effects of spatial dispersion. Besides the thermodynamically nonequilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces, the obtained form of the polarization tensor can be useful for investigation of many diverse physical phenomena in graphene systems, such as surface plasmons, reflectances, electrical conductivity, radiation heat transfer, etc.</description>

      <title>New Quantum Algorithm For Solving Linear System of Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear equations play a pivotal role in many areas of science and engineering, making efficient solutions to linear systems highly desirable. The development of quantum algorithms for solving linear systems has been a significant breakthrough, with such algorithms rapidly becoming some of the most influential in quantum computing. Subsequent advances have focused on improving the efficiency of quantum linear solvers and extending their core techniques to address various challenges, such as least-squares data fitting. In this article, we introduce a new quantum algorithm for solving linear systems based on the gradient descent method. Inspired by the vector/density state formalism, we represent a point, or vector, as a density state-like entity, enabling us to leverage recent advancements in quantum algorithmic frameworks, such as block encoding, to directly manipulate operators and carry out the gradient descent method in a quantum setting. The operator corresponding to the intermediate solution is updated iteratively, with a provable guarantee of convergence. The quantum state representing the final solution to the linear system can then be extracted by further measurement. We provide a detailed complexity analysis and compare our approach with existing methods, demonstrating significant improvement in certain aspects.</description>

      <title>Induced Quantum Divergence: A New Lens on Communication and Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the induced divergence, a new quantum divergence measure that replaces the hypothesis testing divergence in position-based decoding, simplifying the analysis of quantum communication and state redistribution while yielding tighter achievability bounds. Derived from a parent quantum relative entropy, it retains key properties such as data processing inequality and L\"owner monotonicity. Like the hypothesis testing divergence, it depends on a smoothing parameter and interpolates between the parent relative entropy (as the smoothing parameter approaches one) and the min-relative entropy (as it approaches zero), the latter holding when applied to the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy of order $\alpha\in[0,2]$. This framework refines the position-based decoding lemma, extending its applicability to a broader class of states and improving decoding success probabilities. Two key applications are considered: classical communication over quantum channels, where the induced divergence improves lower bounds on the distillable communication rate, and quantum state redistribution, where it leads to sharper bounds on communication costs. These results provide new insights into fundamental single-shot quantum information protocols and enhance existing analytical techniques.</description>

      <title>GPA: Grover Policy Agent for Generating Optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a GPA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits (QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The GPA consists of two parts: the Quantum Policy Evaluation (QPE) and the Quantum Policy Improvement (QPI). The QPE performs phase estimation to generate the search space, while the QPI utilizes Grover search and amplitude amplification techniques to efficiently identify an optimal policy that generates optimal QSCs. The GPA generates QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of gates. The QSCs generated by the GPA are capable of producing entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states. High QFI indicates increased sensitivity to parameter changes, making the circuit useful for quantum state estimation and control tasks. Evaluation of the GPA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of R_x, R_y, and S gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1. Compared to existing quantum agents, the GPA achieves higher QFI with fewer gates, demonstrating a more efficient and scalable approach to the design of QSCs. This work illustrates the potential computational power of quantum agents for solving quantum physics problems</description>

      <title>Correcting and extending Trotterized quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical phenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum computers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their practical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability. In this work, we address these problems by proposing a hybrid ansatz combining the strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using Trotterization, we evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to a simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate classically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the terms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized during the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters. Derivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges arising in the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate three applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to avoid SWAP gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the ansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate errors arising from the Trotterization of the time evolution unitary. Finally, we can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits on the quantum device constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical ansatz.</description>

      <title>Finitely many worlds with finite information flow and Bell theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory does not provide a measurement-independent description of physical processes. Two competing approaches to this issue are single-world ontological theories and Everett many-worlds theory. The former addresses the measurement problem by introducing auxiliary random variables that specify, in particular, the actual values of macroscopic observables. Such models may be psi-epistemic, meaning the quantum state is not part of the ontology. However, all the ontological models break the principle of locality, as demonstrated by Bell's theorem. The latter approach, which is deterministic and psi-ontic, offers the advantage of evading Bell's theorem by delaying the buildup of the correlations until the parties compare their outcomes at a meeting point. Because of determinism and the ontic nature of the quantum state, the number of parallel worlds and the information flow towards the meeting point turn out to be infinite. By integrating the strengths of the two approaches, we introduce a simple psi-epistemic, many-worlds, local model of projective measurements on two spatially separate maximally entangled qubits. Because of its randomness, the model requires only two branches and a finite information flow -- just one bit per measurement is communicated to the meeting point. We explore how this hybrid approach, employing both randomness and branching, addresses key challenges of each individual framework.</description>

      <title>Electron-Enabled Nanoparticle Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating high-mass quantum superposition states of an optically pre-cooled, levitated nanoparticle through electron diffraction at its sub-nanometer crystal lattice. When a single electron undergoes Bragg diffraction at a free-falling nanoparticle, momentum conservation implies that the superposition of Bragg momenta is imprinted onto the relative coordinate between electron and nanoparticle, which entangles their wavefunctions. By imaging the electron interferogram, one maps the nanoparticle state onto a superposition of Bragg momenta, as if it was diffracted by its own lattice. This results in a coherent momentum splitting approximately 1000 times greater than what is achievable with two-photon recoils in conventional standing-wave gratings. Self-interference of the nanoparticle can thus be observed within drastically shorter free-fall times in a time-domain Talbot interferometer configuration, significantly relaxing source requirements and alleviating decoherence from environmental factors such as residual gas and thermal radiation. Shorter interference times also allow for a recapture of the nanoparticle within its initial trapping volume, facilitating its reuse in many rapid experimental duty cycles. This opens new possibilities for experimental tests of macroscopic quantum effects within a transmission electron microscope.</description>

      <title>The Round Complexity of Black-Box Post-Quantum Secure Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the round complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the post-quantum regime. Our focus is on the fully black-box setting, where both the construction and security reduction are black-box. Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard simulation-based security within constant rounds unless $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$. This leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved. Specifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable within polynomial rounds; also, the existence of constant-round constructions with respect to $\epsilon$-simulation, a relaxed yet useful alternative to standard simulation, remains unestablished.
  This work provides positive answers. We introduce the first black-box construction for PQ-MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our construction requires only $\omega(1)$ rounds. These results have already been applied in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC and $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP}$ in Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].
  As for $\epsilon$-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22] resolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the multi-party case open. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box, constant-round construction in the multi-party setting, instantiable using various standard post-quantum primitives.
  En route, we obtain a black-box, constant-round post-quantum commitment achieving a weaker version of 1-many non-malleability, from post-quantum one-way functions. Besides its role in our MPC construction, this commitment also reduces the assumption used in the quantum parallel repetition lower bound by Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate further applications in the future.</description>

      <title>On the Addressability Problem on CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in asymptotically good quantum codes have intensified research on their application in quantum computation and fault-tolerant operations. This study focuses on the addressability problem within CSS codes: what circuits might implement logical gates on strict subsets of logical qubits? With some notion of fault-tolerance, we show some impossibility results: for CSS codes with non-zero rate, one cannot address a logical H, HP, PH, nor CNOT to any non-empty strict subset of logical qubits using a circuit made only from 1-local Clifford gates.
  Furthermore, we show that one cannot permute the logical qubits in a code purely by permuting the physical qubits, if the rate of the code is (asymptotically) greater than 1/3. We can show a similar no-go result for CNOTs and CZs between two such high-rate codes, albeit with a less reasonable restriction to circuits that we call ``global'' (though recent addressable CCZ gates use global circuits).
  This work pioneers the study of distance-preserving addressability in quantum codes, mainly by considering automorphisms of the code. This perspective offers new insights and potential directions for future research. We argue that studying this trade off between addressability and efficiency of the codes is essential to understand better how to do efficient quantum computation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is increasingly important in classical and quantum domains, especially when studying open systems, $PT$ symmetry, and resonances. However, the quantum simulation of these models has been limited by the extensive resources necessary in iterative methods with exponentially small postselection success probability. Here we employ a fixed-depth variational circuit to circumvent these limitations, enabling simulation deep into the $PT$-broken regime surrounding an exceptional point. Quantum simulations are carried out using IBM superconducting qubits. The results underscore the potential for variational quantum circuits and machine learning to push the boundaries of quantum simulation, offering new methods for exploring quantum phenomena with near-term intermediate-scale quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of realism through quantum discord suppression in photonic weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of realism from the quantum domain, often associated with the suppression of quantum features, is a key aspect of the quantum-to-classical transition. In this work, we implement an experiment with Werner states subjected to weak measurements to investigate how quantum correlations influence the emergence of realism. Maximally entangled twin photons, generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, are used to prepare Werner states. We employ a monitoring model that smoothly transitions between weak and strong nonselective measurements, along with an irrealism measure. Our findings demonstrate that quantum discord suppression induced by weak measurements, known as weak quantum discord, drives the emergence of realism. Additionally, our findings highlight the robustness of the irrealism measure in quantum correlation-based scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the effects of shear deformations in a wide class of holographic amorphous solids. It is found that both the shear stress and the complexity of formation grow with the increase of the shear strain. Notably, in the regime of very large shear, they exhibit coordinated behavior and adhere to a universal scaling relation, uncovering a surprising connection between two seemingly unrelated aspects of amorphous systems. Furthermore, our findings also provide a counterexample to the previous understanding that the complexity scales linearly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for large static black holes.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in finite cutoff JT gravity: A study of baby universes and (Krylov) complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, as an application of the `Complexity = Volume' proposal, we calculate the growth of the interior of a black hole at late times for finite cutoff JT gravity. Due to this integrable, irrelevant deformation, the spectral properties are modified non-trivially. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) length saturates faster than pure JT gravity. We comment on the possible connection between Krylov Complexity and ERB length for deformed theory. Apart from this, we calculate the emission probability of baby universes for the deformed theory and make remarks on its implications for the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. Finally, we compute the correction to the volume of the moduli space due to the non-perturbative change of the spectral curve because of the finite cutoff at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven towards the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a four-fold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground state degeneracies, fractional quasi-particles, non-vanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under corresponding conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that our analysis reveals a repulsive-dominant polaron exists as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations are essential in modeling complex phenomena across diverse fields, yet they pose significant challenges due to their computational complexity, especially in higher dimensions. This study explores Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks within an encoder-decoder framework, integrating Variational Quantum Circuits into Gated Recurrent Units and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Using this architecture, the model efficiently compresses high-dimensional spatiotemporal data into a compact latent space, facilitating more efficient temporal evolution. We evaluate the algorithms on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, Burgers' equation, the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system, and the three dimensional Michaelis-Menten reaction-diffusion equation. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the quantum-based algorithms in capturing nonlinear dynamics, handling high-dimensional spaces, and providing stable solutions, highlighting their potential as an innovative tool in solving challenging and complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

Abstract: We propose novel non-relativistic fluid analogue models, that is dumb hole models, for extremal and near-extremal black holes. Further we study the back-reaction effects of analogue Hawking radiation emitted from these dumb holes. We discuss and quantify the reduction in the background fluid velocity caused by radiation of Hawking phonons. In doing so, we speculate on the existence of an emergent Hawking force which leads to the reduction in the background fluid velocity and which is produced as a consequence of phonon emission. In addition to the analogue gravity literature, our results might be of relevance to black hole pedagogy.</description>

      <title>Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains nonperturbative in $\hbar$ correction. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Escaping from the Barren Plateau via Gaussian Initializations in Deep Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have been widely employed in quantum simulation and quantum machine learning in recent years. However, quantum circuits with random structures have poor trainability due to the exponentially vanishing gradient with respect to the circuit depth and the qubit number. This result leads to a general standpoint that deep quantum circuits would not be feasible for practical tasks. In this work, we propose an initialization strategy with theoretical guarantees for the vanishing gradient problem in general deep quantum circuits. Specifically, we prove that under proper Gaussian initialized parameters, the norm of the gradient decays at most polynomially when the qubit number and the circuit depth increase. Our theoretical results hold for both the local and the global observable cases, where the latter was believed to have vanishing gradients even for very shallow circuits. Experimental results verify our theoretical findings in the quantum simulation and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Properties of quantum emitters in different hBN sample types particularly suited for nanophotonic integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single photon emitters in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising solid-state quantum emitters for photonic applications and quantum networks. Despite their favorable properties, much is still unknown about their characteristics and their atomic origin. We focus on two different kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with nanophotonic devices, multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and a layer-engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). We investigate their inherent defects and fit their emission properties to computationally simulated optical properties of likely carbon-related defects. Thereby we compare and elucidate the properties in different sample types particularly suited for photonic quantum networks and narrow down the origin of emitters found in these samples. Our work is thus an important step towards harnessing the full potential of single photon emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>No-Signaling in Steepest Entropy Ascent: A Nonlinear Non-local Non-equilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Composite Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindbladian formalism models open quantum systems using a 'bottom-up' approach, deriving linear dynamics from system-environment interactions. We present a 'top-down' approach starting with phenomenological constraints, focusing on system's structure, subsystems' interactions, environmental effects, and often using a non-equilibrium variational principle designed to enforce strict thermodynamic consistency. However, incorporating the second law's requirement -- that Gibbs states are the sole stable equilibria -- necessitates nonlinear dynamics, challenging no-signaling principles in composite systems. We reintroduce 'local perception operators' and show that they allow to model signaling-free non-local effects. Using the steepest-entropy-ascent variational principle as an example, we demonstrate the validity of the 'top-down' approach for integrating quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in phenomenological models, with potential applications in quantum computing and resource theories.</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Positive and Invariant Tensor Decompositions: Applications to Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix rank and its positive versions are robust for small approximations, i.e. they do not decrease under small perturbations. In contrast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be a gap between rank and border rank, leading to instabilities in the optimization over sets with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite positive ranks also collapse for small perturbations? In this work, we prove that multipartite positive and invariant tensor decompositions exhibit gaps between rank and border rank, including tensor rank purifications and cyclic separable decompositions. We also prove a correspondence between positive decompositions and membership in certain sets of multipartite probability distributions, and leverage the gaps between rank and border rank to prove that these correlation sets are not closed. It follows that testing membership of probability distributions arising from resources like translational invariant Matrix Product States is impossible in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on the instability of ranks and the unique behavior of bipartite systems.</description>

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing is a computational paradigm which employs an analog Hamiltonian resource together with single-qubit gates to reach universality. Here, we design a new scheme which employs an arbitrary two-body source Hamiltonian, extending the experimental applicability of this computational paradigm to most quantum platforms. We show that the simulation of an arbitrary two-body target Hamiltonian of $n$ qubits requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ analog blocks with guaranteed positive times, providing a polynomial advantage compared to the previous scheme. Additionally, we propose a classical strategy which combines a Bayesian optimization with a gradient descent method, improving the performance by $\sim55\%$ for small systems measured in the Frobenius norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of remarkable recent advances, quantum computers still lack useful applications. A promising direction for such utility is offered by the simulation of the dynamics of many-body quantum systems, which cannot be efficiently computed classically. Recently, IBM used a superconducting quantum computer to simulate a kicked quantum Ising model with large numbers of qubits and time steps. These results were later reproduced using numerical techniques based on tensor networks and Clifford expansion. In this work, we analyze the experiment in the eyes of a simple-minded mean-field approximation. We treat neighboring qubits as a self-consistent source of dephasing and express them in terms of Kraus operators. Although our approach completely disregards entanglement between qubits, it captures the overall dependence of physical observables as a function of time and external magnetic field. This observation can help rationalize the success of the quantum computer in solving this specific problem.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Arithmetic of Single Qutrit Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study single qutrit circuits consisting of words over the Clifford$+D$ cyclotomic gate set, where $D=\text{diag}(\pm\xi^{a},\pm\xi^{b},\pm\xi^{c})$, $\xi$ is a primitive $9$-th root of unity and $a,b,c$ are integers. We characterize classes of qutrit unit vectors $z$ with entries in $\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$ based on the possibility of reducing their smallest denominator exponent (sde) with respect to $\chi := 1 - \xi,$ by acting an appropriate gate in Clifford$+D$. We do this by studying the notion of `derivatives mod $3$' of an arbitrary element of $\mathbb{Z}[\xi]$ and using it to study the smallest denominator exponent of $HDz$ where $H$ is the qutrit Hadamard gate and $D$. In addition, we reduce the problem of finding all unit vectors of a given sde to that of finding integral solutions of a positive definite quadratic form along with some additional constraints. As a consequence we prove that the Clifford$+D$ gates naturally arise as gates with sde $0$ and $3$ in the group $U(3,\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}])$ of $3 \times 3$ unitaries with entries in $\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$. We illustrate the general applicability of these methods to obtain an exact synthesis algorithm for Clifford$+R$ and recover the previous exact synthesis algorithm in \cite{kmm}. The framework developed to formulate qutrit gate synthesis for Clifford$+D$ extends to qudits of arbitrary prime power.</description>

In this paper we establish that this must necessarily be the case, if the locality graph is complex enough (for example for regular 2$d$ lattices). In particular we show that, in case of exact encodings, a fully local mapping is possible if and only if the locality graph is a tree. If instead we allow ourselves to also consider operators that only act fermionically on a subspace of the qubit Hilbert space, then we show that this subspace must be composed of long range entangled states, if the locality graph contains at least two overlapping cycles. This implies, for instance, that on 2$d$ lattices there exist states that are of low depth from the fermionic point of view, while in any encoding require a circuit of depth at least proportional to the system size to be prepared.</description>

Abstract: Classical coupled harmonic oscillator models are capable of describing the optical and infrared response of nanophotonic systems where a cavity photon couples to dipolar matter excitations. The distinct forms of coupling adopted in these classical models leads to different results in the ultrastrong coupling regime. To clarify the specific classical model required to address particular configurations, we establish a connection between each oscillator model and the equivalent cavity Quantum Electrodynamics description. We show that the proper choice of coupled harmonic oscillator model depends on the presence or absence of the diamagnetic term in the quantum models, linked to whether transverse or longitudinal electromagnetic fields mediate the coupling. This analysis also shows how to exploit the classical oscillator models to extract measurable information of the optical response, as demonstrated in three canonical photonic systems, and to describe the opening of the Reststrahlen band in the bulk dispersion of phononic materials</description>

Abstract: The description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers that are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size, and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <title>Enhancing interferometry using weak value amplification with real weak values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ultra-sensitive interferometric protocol that combines weak value amplification (WVA) with traditional interferometry. This protocol WVA + interferometry uses weak value amplification of the relative delay between two paths to enhance interferometric sensitivity. As an example, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment that achieves few-attosecond timing resolution (few nanometer path length resolution) with a double-slit interferometer using only common optical components. Since our example uses only the spatial shift of double-slit interference fringes, its precision is not limited by the timing resolution of the detectors, {but is instead limited by the fundamental shot noise associated with classical light and the diminished technical noise}. We experimentally demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude relative to a measurement that does not use WVA. Two key conclusions are drawn: (i) Most conventional interferometric techniques primarily rely on determining the path difference (time delay or longitudinal phase), with their precision constrained by technical noise. Our protocol offers a robust solution for minimizing the technical noise in traditional interferometry, with precision in principle approaching the shot-noise limit. (ii) Although WVA has achieved significant advancements in ultra-sensitive longitudinal phase measurement, its applicability is constrained by the need for broad spectral bandwidths and high-resolution spectrometers. Contrary to previous assumptions, we demonstrate that quantum-limited WVA time delay measurements are achievable with narrowband light using real weak values.</description>

      <title>Quantum Unitary Matrix Representation of Lattice Boltzmann Model for Low Reynolds Fluid Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate fluid flows in the low Reynolds number regime. First, we encode the particle distribution functions (PDFs) as probability amplitudes of the quantum state and demonstrate the need to control the state of the ancilla qubit during the initial state preparation. Second, we express the LB algorithm as a matrix-vector product by neglecting the quadratic non-linearity in the equilibrium distribution function, wherein the vector represents the PDFs, and the matrix represents the collision and streaming operators. Third, we employ classical singular value decomposition (SVD) to decompose the non-unitary collision and streaming operators into a product of unitary matrices. Finally, we show the importance of having a Hadamard gate between the collision and the streaming operations. Our approach has been tested on linear/linearized flow problems such as the advection-diffusion of a Gaussian hill, Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, and lid-driven cavity problems. We provide counts for two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) and single-qubit U gates for test cases involving 9 to 12 qubits, with grid sizes ranging from 24 to 216 points. While the gate count aligns closely with theoretical limits, the high number of two-qubit gates on the order of $10^7$ necessitates careful attention to circuit synthesis.</description>

Abstract: Bell monogamy relations characterize the trade-offs in Bell inequality violations among pairs of players in multiplayer settings. In this work, we introduce a method for extending monogamy relations from a distinguished set of configurations to monogamy relations on all possible multiplayer settings. Applying this approach, we show that nonlocality in the CHSH game arises in only two cases: the original two-player scenario and the four-player scenario on a line. While the bound for this four-player scenario follows from known quadratic monogamy constraints, we also establish two new six-party numerical monogamy relations that cannot be derived from existing results. In particular, we show there are points in the intersection of consecutive quadratic Bell monogamy relations which are not quantum realizable. Finally, we present a nonlocal game in which a single player can simultaneously saturate the quantum value with two other parties. This is the first known example of a nonlocal game unaffected by the monogamous nature of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state relative to any product state. In this work, we establish several properties of this type of Renyi mutual information, including its additivity for $\alpha\in [1/2,2]$. As an application, we show that the direct exponent of certain binary quantum state discrimination problems is determined by the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$. This provides an operational interpretation of this type of Renyi mutual information, and generalizes a previous result for classical probability distributions to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Approximating dynamical correlation functions with constant depth quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important quantities characterizing the microscopic properties of quantum systems are dynamical correlation functions. These correlations are obtained by time-evolving a perturbation of an eigenstate of the system, typically the ground state. In this work, we study approximations of these correlation functions that do not require time dynamics. We show that having access to a circuit that prepares an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is possible to approximate the dynamical correlation functions up to exponential accuracy in the complex frequency domain $\omega=\Re(\omega)+i\Im(\omega)$, on a strip above the real line $\Im(\omega)=0$. We achieve this by exploiting the continued fraction representation of the dynamical correlation functions as functions of frequency $\omega$, where the level $k$ approximant can be obtained by measuring a weight $O(k)$ operator on the eigenstate of interest. In the complex $\omega$ plane, we show how this approach allows to determine approximations to correlation functions with accuracy that increases exponentially with $k$.
  We analyse two algorithms to generate the continuous fraction representation in scalar or matrix form, starting from either one or many initial operators. We prove that these algorithms generate an exponentially accurate approximation of the dynamical correlation functions on a region sufficiently far away from the real frequency axis. We present numerical evidence of these theoretical results through simulations of small lattice systems. We comment on the stability of these algorithms with respect to sampling noise in the context of quantum simulation using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian encoding algorithms for extracting quantum control mechanism as interfering pathway amplitudes in the Dyson series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian encoding is a methodology for revealing the mechanism behind the dynamics governing controlled quantum systems. In this paper, following Mitra and Rabitz [Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)], we define mechanism via pathways of eigenstates that describe the evolution of the system, where each pathway is associated with a complex-valued amplitude corresponding to a term in the Dyson series. The evolution of the system is determined by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. Pathways with similar attributes can be grouped together into pathway classes. The amplitudes of pathway classes are computed by modulating the Hamiltonian matrix elements and decoding the subsequent evolution of the system rather than by direct computation of the individual terms in the Dyson series. The original implementation of Hamiltonian encoding was computationally intensive and became prohibitively expensive in large quantum systems. This paper presents two new encoding algorithms that calculate the amplitudes of pathway classes by using techniques from graph theory and algebraic topology to exploit patterns in the set of allowed transitions, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be modulated. These new algorithms provide an exponential decrease in both computation time and memory utilization with respect to the Hilbert space dimension of the system. To demonstrate the use of these techniques, they are applied to two illustrative state-to-state transition problems.</description>

Abstract: We study a mechanical oscillator coupled to a two-level system driven by a blue-detuned coherent source in the resolved sideband regime. For weak mechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles. They are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with a large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly similar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the mechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We demonstrate that these properties can be detected by measuring the photon-emission spectrum, which enables the reconstruction of the Wigner function. We then discuss the relation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these effects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules coupled to oscillators.</description>

Abstract: This study employs Krylov-based information measures to understand task performance in quantum reservoir computing, a sub-field of quantum machine learning. In our study we show that fidelity and spread complexity can only explain the task performance for short time evolutions of the quantum systems. We then discuss two measures, Krylov expressivity and Krylov observability, and compare them to task performance and the information processing capacity. Our results show that Krylov observability exhibits almost identical behavior to information processing capacity, while being three orders of times faster to compute. In the case when the system is undersampled Krylov observability best captures the behavior of the task performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, understanding thermodynamics in the quantum regime has garnered significant attention, driven by advances in nanoscale physics and experimental techniques. In parallel, growing evidence supports the importance of quantum effects in various biological processes, making them increasingly relevant to quantum thermodynamics. In this study, we apply resource theory formulations of thermodynamics to investigate the role of quantum properties in ion transport across cell membranes. Within this framework, quantum properties are treated as resources under generalized thermodynamic constraints in the quantum regime. Specifically, our findings reveal that non-Markovianity, which reflects memory effects in ion transport dynamics, serves as a key quantum resource that enhances the yield and efficiency of the ion transport process. In contrast, quantum coherence, manifested as the superposition of energy states in ion-transport proteins, reduces these metrics but plays a crucial role in distinguishing between ion channels and ion pumps: two distinct types of ion-transport proteins in cell membranes. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing an additional coherent system allows coherence to facilitate the transformation of an ion pump into an ion channel.</description>

Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most significant foundational principles underlying nature. The resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) is a resource-theoretic framework for investigating asymmetry as a resource to break constraints imposed by symmetries. It has recently undergone significant developments, resulting in applications in a variety of research areas since symmetry and its breaking are ubiquitous in physics. Nevertheless, the resource conversion theory at the core of RTA remains incomplete. In the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) setup, where identical copies of a state are converted to identical copies of another state, conversion theory among pure states has been completed only for $U(1)$ group and finite groups. Here, we establish an i.i.d. conversion theory among any pure states in RTA for any continuous symmetry described by a compact Lie group, which includes the cases where multiple conserved quantities are involved. We show that the quantum geometric tensor is an asymmetry monotone for pure states that determines the optimal approximate asymptotic conversion rate. Our formulation achieves a unified understanding of conversion rates in prior studies for different symmetries. As a corollary of the formula, we also affirmatively prove the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on reversible asymptotic convertibility in RTA, which has remained unproven for a decade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits offer expressive and data-efficient representations for machine learning. Due to quantum states residing in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, parametrised quantum circuits have a natural interpretation in terms of kernel methods. The representation of quantum circuits in terms of quantum kernels has been studied widely in quantum supervised learning, but has been overlooked in the context of quantum RL. This paper proposes parametric and non-parametric policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with quantum kernel policies in quantum environments. This approach, implemented with both numerical and analytical quantum policy gradient techniques, allows exploiting the many advantages of kernel methods, including data-driven forms for functions (and their gradients) as well as tunable expressiveness. The proposed approach is suitable for vector-valued action spaces and each of the formulations demonstrates a quadratic reduction in query complexity compared to their classical counterparts. Two actor-critic algorithms, one based on stochastic policy gradient and one based on deterministic policy gradient (comparable to the popular DDPG algorithm), demonstrate additional query complexity reductions compared to quantum policy gradient algorithms under favourable conditions.</description>

Abstract: Bell measurements, entailing the projection onto one of the Bell states, play a key role in quantum information and communication, where the outcome of a variety of protocols crucially depends on the success probability of such measurements. Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be implemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer true for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In order to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear effects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell measurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer devices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different Bell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by the dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus paving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell measurement.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Autonomous and Controlled Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are a rich area of research in the intersection of quantum mechanics and stochastic analysis. By considering a variety of master equations, we unify multiple views of autonomous and controlled open quantum systems and, through considering their measurement dynamics, connect them to classical linear and bilinear system identification theory. This allows us to formulate corresponding notions of quantum state identifiability for these systems which, in particular, applies to quantum state tomography, providing conditions under which the probed quantum system is reconstructible. Interestingly, the dynamical representation of the system lends itself to considering two types of identifiability: the full master equation recovery and the recovery of the corresponding system matrices of the linear and bilinear systems. Both of these concepts are discussed in detail, and conditions under which reconstruction is possible are given. We set the groundwork for a number of constructive approaches to the identification of open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive and a cornerstone for numerous two-party cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs. However, it has been proven that unconditionally secure bit commitment, both classical and quantum, is impossible. In this work, we demonstrate that imposing a restriction on the committing party to perform only separable operations enables secure quantum bit commitment schemes. Specifically, we prove that in any perfectly hiding bit commitment protocol, an honestly-committing party limited to separable operations will be detected with high probability if they attempt to alter their commitment. To illustrate our findings, we present an example protocol.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum algorithms for characters of the symmetric group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characters of irreducible representations are ubiquitous in group theory. However, computing characters of some groups such as the symmetric group $S_n$ is a challenging problem known to be $\#P$-hard in the worst case. Here we describe a Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm for characters of $S_n$. The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all irreducible characters of a given permutation. It relies on a mapping from characters of $S_n$ to quantum spin chains proposed by Crichigno and Prakash. We also provide a simpler derivation of this mapping. We complement this result by presenting a $poly(n)$ size quantum circuit that prepares the corresponding MPS, obtaining an efficient quantum algorithm for certain sampling problems based on characters of $S_n$. To assess classical hardness of these problems we present a general reduction from strong simulation (computing a given probability) to weak simulation (sampling with a small error). This reduction applies to any sampling problem with a certain granularity structure and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exponential Improvement on Asian Option Pricing Through Quantum Preconditioning Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum algorithm designed to solve the differential equation used in the pricing of Asian options, in the framework of the Black-Scholes model. Our approach modifies an existing quantum pre-conditioning method (different from classical methods) for the problem of Asian option pricing such that we remove the dependence on the original condition number of discretized differential equation (system of linear equations). This was possible with new fast-forwardable discretizations of the first and second derivatives with respect to the underlying asset value ratio (value over average). We determine that these discretizations handle well kinks in the initial/terminal conditions. We also introduce a new circuit construction for the discretized time-derivative operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions which avoids the oracle workspace needed for the general sparse matrix implementation. Here, we also devised a new method probability integral estimation from which we extract the solution, achieving $\tilde{O}({\rm polylog}\left(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is an exponential improvement over other quantum methods when it comes to solution information extraction from the solution state.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Quantum decision trees with information entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classification algorithm for quantum states, inspired by decision-tree methods. To adapt the decision-tree framework to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, we utilize conditional probabilities to compute information gain, thereby optimizing the measurement scheme. For each measurement shot on an unknown quantum state, the algorithm selects the observable with the highest expected information gain, continuing until convergence. We demonstrate using the simulations that this algorithm effectively identifies quantum states sampled from the Haar random distribution. However, despite not relying on circuit-based quantum neural networks, the algorithm still encounters challenges akin to the barren plateau problem. In the leading order, we show that the information gain is proportional to the variance of the observable's expectation values over candidate states. As the system size increases, this variance, and consequently the information gain, are exponentially suppressed, which poses significant challenges for classifying general Haar-random quantum states. Finally, we apply the quantum decision tree to classify the ground states of various Hamiltonians using physically-motivated observables. On both simulators and quantum computers, the quantum decision tree yields better performances when compared to methods that are not information-optimized. This indicates that the measurement of physically-motivated observables can significantly improve the classification performance, guiding towards the future direction of this approach.</description>

Abstract: We introduce wavefront shaping as a tool for optimizing the sensitivity in nano-optomechanical measurement schemes. We perform multimode output analysis of an optomechanical system consisting of a focused laser beam coupled to the transverse motion of a tapered cantilever, and demonstrate that wavefront shaping enables a 350-fold enhancement of the measurement signal-to-noise (+25.5 dB) compared to standard split-detection, close to the quantum precision limit. Our results open new perspectives in terms of sensitivity and control of the optomechanical interaction.</description>

      <title>NRQNN: The Role of Observable Selection in Noise-Resilient Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the complexities associated with training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) under noisy conditions, a critical consideration for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We first demonstrate that Barren Plateaus (BPs), characterized by exponetially vanishing gradients, emerge more readily in noisy quantum environments than in ideal conditions. We then propose that careful selection of qubit measurement observable can make QNNs resilient against noise. To this end, we explore the effectiveness of various qubit measurement observables, including PauliX, PauliY, PauliZ, and a custom designed Hermitian observable, against three types of quantum noise: Phase Damping, Phase Flip, and Amplitude Damping. Our findings reveal that QNNs employing Pauli observables are prone to an earlier emergence of BPs, notably in noisy environments, even with a smaller qubit count of four qubits. Conversely, the custom designed Hermitian measurement observable exhibits significant resilience against all types of quantum noise, facilitating consistent trainability for QNNs up to 10 qubits. This study highlights the crucial role of observable selection and quantum noise consideration in enhancing QNN training, offering a strategic approach to improve QNN performance in NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a programmable photonic platform that integrates Thouless pumping and reconfigurable lasing in sliding bilayer photonic crystals. By engineering two periodic potentials -- a slowly moving photonic grating atop a stationary one -- we demonstrate how their interplay yields distinct topological phases characterized by either robust light transport (Thouless pumping) or localized spatial oscillation (trapping). A heterojunction between crystals in these two regimes supports an interface mode stemming from the topological phase transition across the boundary. This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers. Our findings provide a framework for exploring topological phase transitions and unify the fields of topological photonics and programmable photonic devices, opening avenues for multidimensionally tunable light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of quantum computers in Gibbs sampling from continuous real-valued functions, we ask whether such algorithms can provide practical advantages for machine learning models trained on classical data and seek measures for quantifying such impacts. In this study, we focus on deep energy-based models (EBM), as they require continuous-domain Gibbs sampling both during training and inference. In lieu of fault-tolerant quantum computers that can execute quantum Gibbs sampling algorithms, we use the Monte Carlo simulation of diffusion processes as a classical alternative. More specifically, we investigate whether long-run persistent chain Monte Carlo simulation of Langevin dynamics improves the quality of the representations achieved by EBMs. We consider a scheme in which the Monte Carlo simulation of a diffusion, whose drift is given by the gradient of the energy function, is used to improve the adversarial robustness and calibration score of an independent classifier network. Our results show that increasing the computational budget of Gibbs sampling in persistent contrastive divergence improves both the calibration and adversarial robustness of the model, suggesting a prospective avenue of quantum advantage for generative AI using future large-scale quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Photonic circuits, engineered to couple optical modes according to a specific map, serve as processors for classical and quantum light. The number of components typically scales with that of processed modes, thus correlating system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. Here we present a photonic-circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps in free space, coupling a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to a quantum walk of structured photons, realized through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having their optic axes artificially patterned. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, while keeping losses constant. The patterns can be designed to replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss non-integrated photonic circuits, primarily for manipulating multi-photon states in quantum regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We show that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximal response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the numerical findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.</description>
