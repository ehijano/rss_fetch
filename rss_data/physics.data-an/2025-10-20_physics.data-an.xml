      <title>Reliable data clustering with Bayesian community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From neuroscience and genomics to systems biology and ecology, researchers rely on clustering similarity data to uncover modular structure. Yet widely used clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and WGCNA, lack principled model selection, leaving them susceptible to noise. A common workaround sparsifies a correlation matrix representation to remove noise before clustering, but this extra step introduces arbitrary thresholds that can distort the structure and lead to unreliable results. To detect reliable clusters, we capitalize on recent advances in network science to unite sparsification and clustering with principled model selection. We test two Bayesian community detection methods, the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model and the Regularized Map Equation, both grounded in the Minimum Description Length principle for model selection. In synthetic data, they outperform traditional approaches, detecting planted clusters under high-noise conditions and with fewer samples. Compared to WGCNA on gene co-expression data, the Regularized Map Equation identifies more robust and functionally coherent gene modules. Our results establish Bayesian community detection as a principled and noise-resistant framework for uncovering modular structure in high-dimensional data across fields.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in Unfolding Considering the Likelihood Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the treatment of systematic uncertainties in a Likelihood formalism. RooUnfold, which includes most of the unfolding methods that are commonly used in particle physics, is used to compare a newly implemented method inside this toolkit to existing methods. The interface with the RooFit statistical software package is used for the treatment of systematic uncertainties. The RooUnfold package with RooFit interface, commonly called RooFitUnfold, provides a common interface to unfolding algorithms as well as common uniform methods to evaluate their performance in terms of bias, variance and coverage. This paper exploits this common interface to compare the performance of unfolding with a Tikhonov regularisation term directly in the likelihood with an unfolding method that optimises a Tikhonov regularisation applied separately of the likelihood formalism. Comparisons are made with and without the treatment of (systematic) uncertainties and are applied to an example problem.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Navigating Inference with Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in sensitivity to new phenomena across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However, due to the sophistication of modern machine learning algorithms and their reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and experimental data can significantly limit their effectiveness. In this work, we present a solution to this ``misspecification'' problem: a model calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through jet tagging, using a dataset inspired by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A 128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent'' representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing the unbiased use of ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly, this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations across the sciences.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of inner and outer motions in near-wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the causality of near-wall inner and outer turbulent motions. The inner motions are defined as the self-sustained near-wall cycle, and the outer motions as those living in the logarithmic layer exhibiting footprints on the near-wall region. Causal inference with three typical methods is performed, i.e. transfer entropy, information flow, and SURD (synergistic--unique--redundant decomposition of causality). The causal inference methods are first applied to several canonical problems to illustrate their abilities and differences, including a linear problem, a non-linear problem, and a low-dimensional model of near-wall turbulence. It is demonstrated that all three methods can produce consistent causal findings. Furthermore, we study the causalities between the inner and outer turbulent motions in a channel flow using the three methods with an improved inner-outer decomposition method. It is revealed that both the inner and outer motions are self-sustained and independent of each other, supporting the self-sustaining mechanism of turbulent motions at all scales. We also find that there are top-down and bottom-up influences in the outer motions and their near-wall footprints, challenging the traditional sole top-down view. More interestingly, pressure is identified to play an active role in the inner-outer causalities and may act as a bridge in linking the inner and outer turbulent motions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scotogenic Parameter Spaces and Mapping Uncharted Dark Matter Phenomenology with Multi-Objective Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel artificial intelligence approach to explore beyond Standard Model parameter spaces by leveraging a multi-objective optimisation algorithm. We apply this methodology to a non-minimal scotogenic model which is constrained by Higgs mass, anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, dark matter relic density, dark matter direct detection, neutrino masses and mixing, and lepton flavour violating processes. Our results successfully expand on the phenomenological realisations presented in previous work. We compare between multi- and single-objective algorithms and we observe more phenomenologically diverse solutions and an improved search capacity coming from the former. We use novelty detection to further explore sparsely populated regions of phenomenological interest. These results suggest a powerful search strategy that combines the global exploration of multi-objective optimisation with the exploitation of single-objective optimisation.</description>
