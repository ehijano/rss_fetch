      <title>The Effect of Capital Share on Income Inequality: Identifying the Time Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the link between the capital share and income inequality over the past four decades across 56 countries. Calculating the capital share from national accounts alongside top income share data from the World Inequality Database, which is based on the Distributional National Accounts methodology, we ensure the consistency in the theory and measurement. Employing a structural econometric approach, we account for heterogeneous and time-varying transmission coefficients from the capital share to personal income inequality. Our findings reveal that a one percentage point (pp) increase in the capital share raises the income share of the top 5% by 0.17 pp on average. Advanced economies show a stable transmission coefficient with rising capital and labor income inequality, while emerging economies experience an increasing transmission coefficient alongside growing capital income inequality. In contrast, a third group exhibits a declining transmission coefficient and rising labor income inequality. Overall, changes in the capital share account for approximately 50% of the rise in income inequality, underscoring its pivotal role over the last four decades.</description>

      <title>Strategic Investment to Mitigate Transition Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates strategic investments needed to mitigate transition risks, particularly focusing on sectors significantly impacted by the shift to a low-carbon economy. It emphasizes the importance of tailored sector-specific strategies and the role of government interventions, such as carbon taxes and subsidies, in shaping corporate behavior. In providing a multi-period framework, this paper evaluates the economic and operational trade-offs companies face under four various decarbonization scenarios: immediate, quick, slow, and no transitions. The analysis provides practical insights for both policymakers and business leaders, demonstrating how regulatory frameworks and strategic investments can be aligned to manage transition risks while optimizing long-term sustainability effectively. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the economic impacts of regulatory policies and offer a comprehensive framework to navigate the complexities of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.</description>

      <title>The Explore of Knowledge Management Dynamic Capabilities, AI-Driven Knowledge Sharing, Knowledge-Based Organizational Support, and Organizational Learning on Job Performance: Evidence from Chinese Technological Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing upon Resource-Based Theory (RBT) and the Knowledge-Based View (KBV), this study investigates the impact of Knowledge-Based Organizational Support (KOS), AI-Driven Knowledge Sharing (KS), Organizational Learning (OL), and Knowledge Management Dynamic Capabilities (KMDC) on Organizational Performance (OP) in Chinese firms. In particular, this research explores the relationships among these factors, alongside control variables such as education level, staff skills, and technological innovation, to provide a comprehensive understanding of their influence on performance management. While recent studies on organizational performance have predominantly concentrated on digital business strategies and high-level decision-making, limited attention has been given to the role of digital maturity, workplace activities, and communication-related dynamics. This study addresses these gaps by consolidating critical factors that contribute to overarching job performance within organizations. Moreover, to empirically test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected from 129 valid questionnaires completed by employees across various Chinese firms. The research employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the measurement constructs and structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the hypothesized relationships. The findings reveal several significant insights: (1) KOS, KS with AI, KMDC, and OL each have a direct positive effect on OP, emphasizing their critical roles in enhancing organizational outcomes. (2) Control variables, including education level, staff skills, and technological innovation, significantly moderate the relationships between KOS, KS with AI, KMDC, OL, and OP, further amplifying their impact.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Hidden Nexus between Benford Law Establishment in Stock Market and Market Efficiency: An Empirical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benford's law, or the law of the first significant digit, has been subjected to numerous studies due to its unique applications in financial fields, especially accounting and auditing. However, studies that addressed the law's establishment in the stock markets generally concluded that stock prices do not comply with the underlying distribution. The present research, emphasizing data randomness as the underlying assumption of Benford's law, has conducted an empirical investigation of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The outcomes demonstrated that since stock prices are not distributed randomly, the law cannot be held in the stock market. Besides, the Chi-square goodness-of-fit test also supported the obtained results. Moreover, it is discussed that the lack of randomness originated from market inefficiency. In other words, violating the efficient market hypothesis has caused the time series non-randomness and the failure to establish Benford's law.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Measurement Error in the German Socio-Economic Panel Using Linked Survey and Administrative Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper exploits the linkage of German administrative social security data (GER: Integrierte Erwerbsbiografien) and survey data from the socio-economic panel (GER: Sozio-\"okonomisches Panel, SOEP) for the characterization of measurement error in metrics quantifying individual-specific labor earnings in Germany. We find that survey participants' decision whether to consent to linkage is non-random based on observables. In that sense, the studied sample does not constitute a random sample of SOEP. Measurement error is not classical: we observe underreporting of income on average, autocorrelation, and non-zero correlation with the true signal and other observable characteristics. In levels, calculated reliability ratios above 0.94 hint at a relaitvely small attenuation bias in simple linear univariate regressions with earnings as the explanatory variable. For changes in income, i.e. first differences, the bias from measurement error is exacerbated.</description>

      <title>Environmental Policy in General Equilibrium under Market Power and Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructs a novel analytical general equilibrium model to compare environmental policies in a setting where oligopolistic energy firms engage in third-degree price discrimination across residential consumers and industrial firms. Closed-form solutions demonstrate the impact on prices and quantities. The resulting welfare change is decomposed across three distortions: output, price discrimination, and externality. This study finds that the output distortion and price discrimination welfare effects generally move in opposite directions under policies such as an emission tax or a two-part instrument. Numerical analysis compares policies and finds scenarios where the output distortion and price discrimination welfare changes fully offset and thus leaves the net welfare gain of the externality correction. In this way, environmental policy can be designed to mitigate output distortion welfare concerns when firms have market power.</description>

      <title>When Do Voters Stop Caring? Estimating the Shape of Voter Utility Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a longstanding puzzle over the functional form that better approximates voter's political utility. Though it has become the norm in the literature to represent the voters' political utility with concave loss functions, for decades scholars have underscored this assumption's potential shortcomings. Yet there exists little to no evidence to support one functional form assumption over another. We fill this gap by first identifying electoral settings where the different functional forms generate divergent predictions about voter behavior. Then, we assess which functional form better matches observed voter and abstention behavior using Cast Vote Record (CVR) data that captures the anonymized ballots of millions of voters in the 2020 U.S. general election. Our findings indicate that concave loss functions fail to predict voting and abstention behavior and it is the reverse S-shaped loss functions, such as the Gaussian function, that better match the observed voter behavior.</description>

      <title>Societal Adaptation to AI Human-Labor Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is transforming human labor at an unprecedented pace - improving 10$\times$ per year in training effectiveness. This paper analyzes how society can adapt to AI-driven human-labor automation (HLA), using Bernardi et al.'s societal adaptation framework. Drawing on literature from general automation economics and recent AI developments, the paper develops a "threat model." The threat model is centered on mass unemployment and its socioeconomic consequences, and assumes a non-binary scenario between full AGI takeover and swift job creation. The analysis explores both "capability-modifying interventions" (CMIs) that shape how AI develops, and "adaptation interventions" (ADIs) that help society adjust. Key interventions analyzed include steering AI development toward human-complementing capabilities, implementing human-in-the-loop requirements, taxation of automation, comprehensive reorientation of education, and both material and social substitutes for work. While CMIs can slow the transition in the short-term, significant automation is inevitable. Long-term adaptation requires ADIs - from education reform to providing substitutes for both the income and psychological benefits of work. Success depends on upfront preparation through mechanisms like "if-then commitments", and crafting flexible and accurate regulation that avoids misspecification. This structured analysis of HLA interventions and their potential effects and challenges aims to guide holistic AI governance strategies for the AI economy.</description>

      <title>Strategic Waiting in Centralized Matching: Daycare Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In centralized assignment mechanisms, unassigned participants are often placed on waitlists to improve their chances in future rounds. However, I demonstrate that this practice may bring unintended welfare consequences on the participants, using data from the Japanese daycare system. The prioritization of waitlisted applicants introduces a dynamic incentive for applicants to manipulate their priority by strategically choosing to be waitlisted to secure positions at more selective daycares. I show that 30.0% of applicants do not list safety options when they initially apply and that those who benefit from additional priority are 8.1 percentage points more likely to avoid listing safety options than those who do not. Given the prevalence of such strategic waiting, I estimate a structural model of daycare choice that extends Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to a two-period model allowing for reapplication. By simulating a scenario without waitlist priority, I find that the current priority functions as a redistributive mechanism: through its abolition, early starters (age 0) experience a 34.1% decrease in welfare and a 1.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of being waitlisted, whereas late starters (age 1) experience a 29.0% increase in welfare and a 6.9 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of being waitlisted.</description>

      <title>Mean-field equilibrium price formation with exponential utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using the mean-field game theory, we study a problem of equilibrium price formation among many investors with exponential utility in the presence of liabilities unspanned by the security prices. The investors are heterogeneous in their initial wealth, risk-averseness parameter, as well as stochastic liability at the terminal time. We characterize the equilibrium risk-premium process of the risky stocks in terms of the solution to a novel mean-field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), whose driver has quadratic growth both in the stochastic integrands and in their conditional expectations. We prove the existence of a solution to the mean-field BSDE under several conditions and show that the resultant risk-premium process actually clears the market in the large population limit.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing a decarbonized European energy system fully based on renewable energy sources. Here we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such variable renewable energy droughts. To this end, we combine renewable availability time series analysis and power sector modeling, using 36 historical weather years. We find that extreme drought events define long-duration storage operation and investment. The most extreme event in Europe occurred in the winter of 1996/97. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection, long-duration storage of 351 TWh or 7% of yearly electricity demand is required to deal with this event. As it affects many countries simultaneously, a storage capacity of 159 TWh or 3% of yearly electricity demand remains required even in the extreme case of unconstrained geographical balancing. Before and during Dunkelflaute events, we find complex interactions of long-duration storage with other flexibility options. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that firm zero-emission generation technologies would only moderately reduce long-duration storage needs. Thus, policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage capacity to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe. We further argue that using multiple weather years that include pronounced renewable energy droughts is required for weather-resilient energy system modeling.</description>
