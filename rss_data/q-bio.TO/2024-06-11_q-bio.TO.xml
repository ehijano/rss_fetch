      <title>Overcoming Limitations in Artificial Intelligence-based Prostate Cancer Detection through Better Datasets and a Bayesian Approach to Aggregate Panel Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for prostate cancer detection from whole slide images, the clinical applicability of these models remains limited due to variability in pathological annotations and existing dataset limitations. This article proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by leveraging a Bayesian framework to seamlessly integrate new data, and present results as a panel of annotations. The framework is demonstrated by integrating a Bayesian prior with one trained AI model to generate a distribution of Gleason patterns for each pixel of an image. It is shown that using this distribution of Gleason patterns rather than a ground-truth label can improve model applicability, mitigate errors, and highlight areas of interest for pathologists. Additionally, we present a high-quality, hand-curated dataset of prostate histopathological images annotated at the gland level by trained pre-medical students and verified by an expert pathologist. We highlight the potential of this adaptive and uncertainty-aware framework for developing clinically deployable AI tools that can support pathologists in accurate prostate cancer grading, improve diagnostic accuracy, and create positive patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Charting a finite element, mechanical atlas of dermatologic wound closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wound geometry and the mechanical properties of human skin govern the failure modes of partially healed or scarred tissue. Though dermatologists and surgeons develop an intuitive understanding of the mechanical characteristics of skin through clinical practice, finite element models of wounds can aid in formalizing intuition. In this work, we explore the effect of wound geometry and primary intention closure on the propagation of mechanical stresses through skin. We use a two-layer, orthotropic, hyperelastic model of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis to accurately capture the mechanical and geometric effects at work. We highlight the key assumptions which must be made when modeling closure of wounds by primary intention, clearly delineating promising areas for model improvement. Models are implemented in DOLFINx, an open-source finite element framework, and reference code is provided for reproducible and extensible science.</description>
