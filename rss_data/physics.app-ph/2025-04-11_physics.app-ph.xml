      <title>Computational inverse design of acoustoplasmonic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical and acoustic metasurfaces are two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength elements that locally modulate or phase shift incident waves. Acoustoplasmonic metasurfaces combine the physics of light and sound, producing acoustic wavefronts in response to optical stimuli. Herein, we present a computational inverse acoustoplasmonic metasurface design algorithm for desired optically-generated acoustic wave fields. We consider gold nanoparticles producing spherical acoustic waves in water, and the resulting acoustic wave propagation along the plane containing the nanoparticle array. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to design metasurfaces that can be used to achieve complex acoustic wave fields. This includes the design of a single metasurface that produces acoustic wave fields mimicking two different Morse code patterns upon stimulation with two orthogonal polarization states of light. This work provides a new tool for the design of complex optically generated acoustic wavefronts, enabling functionality beyond what would be achievable with off-optical-resonance optoacoustic excitation.</description>

      <title>Low-voltage Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors with Ultrathin Aluminum Scandium Nitride and 2D channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continued evolution of CMOS technology demands materials and architectures that emphasize low power consumption, particularly for computations involving large scale data processing and multivariable optimization. Ferroelectric materials offer promising solutions through enabling dual-purpose memory units capable of performing both storage and logic operations. In this study, we demonstrate ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) with MoS2 monolayer channels fabricated on ultrathin 5 nm and 10 nm ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films. By decreasing the thickness of the ferroelectric film, we achieve significantly reduced gate voltages (&lt;3V) required to switch the conductance of the devices, enabling operation at low voltages compatible with advanced CMOS. We observe a characteristic crossover in hysteresis behavior that varies with film thickness, channel fabrication method, and environmental conditions. Through systematic investigation of multiple parameters including channel fabrication methods, dimensional scaling, and environmental effects, we provide pathways to improve device performance. While our devices demonstrate clear ferroelectric switching behavior, further optimization is required to enhance the ON/OFF ratio at zero gate voltage while continuing to reduce the coercive field of these ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Suspended Z-cut lithium niobate waveguides for stimulated Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has recently been demonstrated in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), an emerging material platform for integrated photonics offering large electro-optic and nonlinear properties. While previous work on SBS in TFLN have focused on surface SBS, in this contribution we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, backward intra-modal SBS generation in suspended Z-cut TFLN waveguides. Our results show trapping of multiple acoustic modes in this structure, featuring a multi-peak Brillouin gain spectrum due to the excitation of higher-order acoustic modes. The findings expand the TFLN waveguide platform exploration for SBS interactions and provide a crucial step towards realizing optical processors for microwave signals or sensors integrated on TFLN.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non-reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non-reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential.
  In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode (TE11n) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant - both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. Without the need for device fabrication, we demonstrate that single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) can effectively function as a circulator down to 2 K. This approach offers a promising pathway for the development of cryogenic circulators.</description>

      <title>Nanodiamond quantum thermometry assisted with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are quantum sensors that enable local temperature measurements, taking advantage of their small size. Though the model based analysis methods have been used for ND quantum thermometry, their accuracy has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we apply model-free machine learning with the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to ND quantum thermometry and compare its capabilities with the existing methods. We prove that GPR provides more robust results than them, even for a small number of data points and regardless of the data acquisition methods. This study extends the range of applications of ND quantum thermometry with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds of focusing light through multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers, facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in multimode fibers, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we examine the electronic structure of quasi-one-dimensional fullerene nanoribbons derived from two-dimensional fullerene networks. Depending on the edge geometry and width, these nanoribbons exhibit a rich variety of properties, including direct and indirect band gaps, positive and negative effective masses, as well as dispersive and flat bands. Our findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of fullerene nanoribbons, with potential implications for the design of future nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects considering Surface Scattering -- Part I: Physical Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14366v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of interconnect conductivity is important for performance evaluation of chips in advanced technologies. Surface scattering in interconnects is usually treated by using Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) approach. While the FS model offer explicit inclusion of the physical parameters, it lacks spatial dependence of conductivity across the interconnect cross-section. To capture the space-dependency of conductivity, an empirical modeling approach based on "cosh" function has been proposed, but it lacks physical insights. In this work, we present a 2D spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model for rectangular interconnects derived from the Boltzmann transport equations. The proposed SRFS model for surface scattering offers both spatial dependence and explicit relation of conductivity to physical parameters such as mean free path and specularity of electrons and interconnect geometry. We highlight the importance of physics-based spatially resolved conductivity model by showing the differences in the spatial profiles between the proposed physical approach and the previous empirical approach. In Part II of this work, we build upon the SRFS approach to propose a compact model for spatially-resolved conductivity accounting for surface scattering in rectangular interconnects.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects considering Surface Scattering -- Part II: Circuit-Compatible Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interconnect conductivity modeling is a critical aspect for modern chip design. Surface scattering -- an important scattering mechanism in scaled interconnects is usually captured using Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) model which offers the average behavior of the interconnect. However, to support the modern interconnect structures (such as tapered geometries), modeling spatial dependency of conductivity becomes important. In Part I of this work, we presented a spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model for rectangular interconnects derived from the fundamental FS approach. While the proposed SRFS model offers both spatial-dependency of conductivity and its direct relationship with the physical parameters, its complex expression is not suitable for incorporation in circuit simulations. In this part, we build upon our SRFS model to propose a circuit-compatible conductivity model for rectangular interconnects accounting for 2D surface scattering. The proposed circuit-compatible model offers spatial resolution of conductivity as well as explicit dependence on the physical parameters such as electron mean free path (${\lambda}_0$), specularity ($p$) and interconnect geometry. We validate our circuit-compatible model over a range of interconnect width/height (and ${\lambda}_0$) and p values and show a close match with the physical SRFS model proposed in Part I (with error &lt; 0.7%). We also compare our circuit-compatible model with a previous spatially resolved analytical model (appropriately modified for a fair comparison) and show that our model captures the spatial resolution of conductivity and the dependence on physical parameters more accurately. Finally, we present a semi-analytical equation for the average conductivity based on our circuit-compatible model.</description>

      <title>Topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic waves under a surface liquid-layer loading and sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic waves (SAW) under a surface liquid-layer loading are investigated. By revealing influences of the liquid-layer loading on wave velocity of SAW and topological indices (Berry curvature and Chern number) of topological interface-modes, a topological resonance peak with a high Q-factor is obtained based on couplings of a topological interface-mode waveguide and a resonant cavity under a surface liquid-layer loading. The results show that the degree of spatial-inversion-symmetry breaking resulting from structure parameters has an obvious influences on the topological resonance Q-factor, while the influences of the thickness of the liquid-layer loading on that is weak. It is worth noting that the topological resonance frequency is significantly sensitive to the liquid parameters. Based on that, a novel topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor is proposed. Furthermore, sensing performances of this kind of sensor are simulated, which are used to sensing the concentration of hemoglobin, albumin, NaCl and NaI in aqueous solutions, and high sensitivities and Q-factors are obtained. The results presented in this paper can provide an important basis for the realization of highly sensitive and stable SAW micro-liquid-sample biomedical sensors in the future.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Dual Micro-Ring Resonators with Angular GST Modulation: Enabling Ultra-Fast Nonlinear Activation for Neuromorphic Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic technologies are emerging as powerful enablers for neuromorphic computing by delivering ultrafast and energy efficient neural functionalities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel all-optical dual micro ring resonator architecture incorporating the phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) to implement highly precise nonlinear activation functions (NLAFs). Our approach introduces angular positioning of GST segments within the rings, enabling fine-grained control over optical transmission dynamics. Through a systematic evaluation of sixteen distinct phase configurations, we identify an optimal GST placement 180 deg in the first ring and 90 deg in the second that achieves ultra narrowband transmission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of just 0.47 nm. This dual ring configuration provides two distinct resonant wavelengths, facilitating enhanced nonlinear modulation and multi level optical signal processing that closely mimics biological neuron behavior. Notably, the device achieves high contrast transmission, 0 to 0.85, across a 4 nm spectral window while operating at significantly reduced temperatures (100 deg C), outperforming traditional GST based designs.
  Furthermore, the dual-ring architecture enables independent optimization of spectral selectivity and switching contrast capabilities previously unattainable with single ring structures. These results establish a promising pathway toward scalable, high speed neuromorphic photonic systems, offering both the precision and switching speed required for practical on chip neural processing.</description>
