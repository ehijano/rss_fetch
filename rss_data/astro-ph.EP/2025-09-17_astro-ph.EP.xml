      <title>Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light -- III. Modeling and analysis of a decade-long catalog of Earthshine observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthshine observations offer a unique opportunity to study Earth as an exoplanet seen from the Moon. As the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry changes, Earth can be observed as a spatially unresolved exoplanet at different phase angles, providing important context for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets. Here, we present a catalog of Earthshine polarization spectra obtained with FORS2 on the VLT, covering diverse scenes, surface conditions, cloud properties, and weather patterns for over a decade. For the first time, we model this extensive dataset in detail using a homogeneous modeling framework. Previous efforts to model some of these spectra struggled to reproduce the observed polarization continuum, even with advanced 3D radiative transfer models incorporating satellite-derived surface and atmospheric data. We improve upon this with a 3D model that includes subgrid cloud variability, wavelength-dependent surface albedo maps, and an accurate treatment of ocean glint. Our simulations successfully reproduce most observed spectra to a much higher precision than previously possible. Our statistical analysis reveals that the spectral slope in the visible can distinguish between ocean and mixed surfaces in both reflected and polarized light, which is not possible using broadband filters alone. Polarized light at large phase angles, beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime, is particularly effective in differentiating oceans from land, unlike reflected light. We also identify correlations between cloud optical thickness and the polarized spectral slope, and between cloud cover and broadband B-R differences in reflected light, demonstrating the diagnostic power of these observations. This work highlight the potential of polarization for characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. From polarization alone, we can infer oceans, vegetation, and an active water cycle, key indicators of a habitable planet.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an icy and nitrogen-rich extrasolar planetesimal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs accreting planetary debris provide detailed insight into the bulk composition of rocky exo-planetesimals. However, only one Kuiper-Belt analogue has been identified in that way so far. Here, we report the accretion of an icy extra-solar planetesimal onto white dwarf WD 1647+375 using ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope. The accreted material is rich in the volatiles carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur, with a chemical composition analogous to Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) in our solar system. It has a high nitrogen mass fraction ($5.1\pm1.6$ per cent) and large oxygen excess ($84\pm7$ per cent), indicating that the accreted planetesimal is water-rich (a water-to-rock ratio of $\simeq2.45$), corroborating a cometary- or dwarf planet-like composition. The white dwarf has been accreting at a rate of $\approx 2\times10^{8}$ g s$^{-1}$ for the past 13 years, implying a minimum mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g for the icy parent body. The actual mass could be several orders of magnitude larger if the accretion phase lasts $\sim10^5$ yr as estimated in the literature from debris disc studies. We argue that the accreted body is most likely a fragment of a KBO dwarf planet based on its nitrogen-rich composition. However, based on the chemical composition alone, it is difficult to discern whether this icy body is intrinsic to this planetary system, or may have an interstellar origin.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Methods for Detecting Exomoons Orbiting Imaged Exoplanets: Prospects for Detecting Moons Orbiting a Giant Planet in $\alpha$ Centauri A's Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby giant exoplanets offer an opportunity to search for moons (exomoons) orbiting them. Here, we present a simulation framework for investigating the possibilities of detecting exomoons via their astrometric signal in planet-to-star relative astrometry. We focus our simulations on $\alpha$ Centauri A, orbited by a hypothetical giant planet consistent with candidate detections in Very Large Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations. We consider a variety of observatory architectures capable of searching for exomoons, including upcoming facilities and also a hypothetical dedicated facility $-$ e.g., a purpose-built space telescope with diameter = 3m, central observing wavelength of 500 nm, and contrast-limited performance of $\sim$10$^{-9}$ in 1 hr observations. We find that such a facility would be capable of detecting $\sim$Earth-mass moons in a five year campaign, assuming a Saturn-mass planet. More generally, we simulate expected detection limits for a variety of levels of astrometric precision. We find that moons as small as $\sim$0.2 M$_\oplus$ on orbital periods of 4$-$30 days can be detected with astrometric precision of 0.1 mas and observing cadence of 1 hr over a five year campaign. Additionally, we find that a 39m ground-based telescope can detect Earth-sized exomoons orbiting the same hypothetical planet with a more modest observing cadence of one day. We discuss these results as motivation for a dedicated space observatory as well as a more detailed study of the physical parameters of a greater variety of star-planet-moon systems.</description>

      <title>ARDENT: A Python package for fast dynamical detection limits with radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architecture of planetary systems is a key piece of information to our understanding of their formation and evolution. This information also allows us to place the Solar System in the exoplanet context. An important example is the impact of outer giant planets on the formation of inner super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Radial velocity (RV) surveys aim at drawing statistical insights into the (anti-)correlations between giants and inner small planets, which remain unclear. These surveys are limited by the completeness of the systems, namely, the sensitivity of the data to planet detections. Here, we show that we can improve the completeness by accounting for orbital stability. We introduce the Algorithm for the Refinement of DEtection limits via N-body stability Threshold (ARDENT), an open-source Python package for detection limits that include the stability constraint. The code computes the classic data-driven detection limits, along with the dynamical limits via both analytical and numerical stability criteria. We present the code strategy and illustrate its performance on TOI-1736 using published SOPHIE RVs. This system contains an eccentric cold giant on a 570-day orbit and an inner sub-Neptune on a 7-day orbit. We demonstrate that no additional planet can exist in this system beyond 150 days due to the gravitational influence of the giant. This outcome allows us to significantly refine the system completeness and also carries implications for RV follow-ups. ARDENT is user-friendly and can be employed across a wide variety of systems to refine our understanding of their architecture.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Time Variability of 2M1207 A+b with JWST NIRSpec/PRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec/PRISM IFU time-resolved observations of 2M1207 A and b (TWA 27), a $\sim 10$ Myr binary system consisting of a $\sim 2500$ K sub-stellar primary hosting a $\sim 1300$ K companion. Our data provide 20 time-resolved spectra over an observation spanning 12.56 hours. We provide an empirical characterization for the spectra of both objects across time. For 2M1207 A, non-linear trend models are statistically favored within the ranges 0.6-2.3 $\mu$m and 3.8-5.3 $\mu$m. However, most of the periods constrained from sinusoidal models exceed the observing window, setting a lower limit of 12.56 hours. We find the data at H$\alpha$ and beyond 4.35 $\mu$m show a moderate time correlation, as well as a pair of light curves at 0.73-0.80 $\mu$m and 3.36-3.38 $\mu$m. For 2M1207 b, light curves integrated across 0.86-1.77 $\mu$m and 3.29-4.34 $\mu$m support linear trend models. Following the interpretation of Zhang et. al. (2025), we model the 2M1207 b data with two 1D atmospheric components, both with silicate and iron condensates. The model of time variability as changes to the cloud filling factor shows broad consistency with the variability amplitudes derived from our data. Our amplitudes, however, disagree with the models at $\approx$0.86-1 $\mu$m. While an additional model component such as rainout chemistry may be considered here, our analysis is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio. Our results demonstrate the capability of JWST to simultaneously monitor the spectral variability of a planetary-mass companion and host at low contrast.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Refractories: Tracing Dust Evolution in the BP Tau Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the dust of BP Tau's protoplanetary disk. We use new optical spectra of BP Tau, taken with the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph in tandem with archival UV and mid-infrared observations. We use the magnetospheric accretion model to analyze the Ca II K and Mg II 2796.4 \r{A} emission lines and derive the abundance of Ca and Mg in the accretion flows as a proxy for the refractory abundance in the innermost gas disk. Furthermore, we used irradiated accretion disk models to compare the spectral energy distribution (SED) to observations and model in detail the 10$\mu$m and 20$\mu$m silicate features to obtain the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of the dust in which the refractories are locked in the disk. We find a significant degree of depletion of refractory material in the innermost gas disk with median abundances of $\rm [Ca/H] = -2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.0}$ and $\rm [Mg/H] = -1.30^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ and attribute this to both radial drift and dust trapping due to a pressure bump/gap. Our SED modeling recovers the inner cavity that extends up to 8 AU, consistent with sub-mm observations. We found a significant decrease of the Mg-to-Fe ratio with decreasing radius, with Mg-rich silicates in the outer wall and Fayalite in the inner wall, consistent with the Mg depletion inferred from the emission lines.</description>

      <title>Volatile-bearing mineral atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets as probes of interior state and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets (HREs), should they persist, are products of interactions with underlying magma oceans. Spectra collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) hint at a CO/CO$_2$-rich atmosphere on the HRE 55 Cancri e, indicative of such a process. Here, we aim to identify diagnostic features that can be used to infer the composition and geochemical state of HREs. We construct a coupled atmosphere-interior model that computes the equilibrium gas speciation in the atmosphere in the system Si-Mg-Fe-O-C-H-S-N-He. The model accounts for both the equilibrium vaporisation of mineral gases and the partitioning of volatile species between the magma ocean and atmosphere. Using a fiducial planet with the properties of 55 Cancri e, we explore a parameter space that spans volatile mass fractions from 0.1 to 10 times that of the Earth, solar- to Earth-like metallicities, and 12 orders of magnitude in oxygen fugacity fO$_2$. We find fO$_2$ to be the major control of the shape of emission and transmission features. The presence of species such as SO$_2$ and the relative intensities of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ features allow to distinguish the origin of the gas, accreted or outgassed, while the atmospheric mass is more challenging to constrain. Inflated HREs, whose densities are compatible with a nebular atmosphere are rare, but a viable explanation for the planet TOI-1408 c. The majority of HREs, including 55 Cancri e, are too dense to be dominated by H$_2$-rich nebular gas yet too puffy for an Earth-like volatile budget, implying modest atmospheres of mixed heritage that are degenerate in fO$_2$, volatile mass and composition. The MIRI observation of 55 Cancri e disfavours oxidised Earth-like and reduced primoridal atmospheres alike, while the NIRCam data remain inconclusive. Future observations at wavelengths beyond 8 $\mu$m are key to discerning between potential scenarios.</description>

      <title>Investigating aerosols as a reconciliation mechanism for K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Diversity in planetary architectures from pebble accretion: Water delivery to the habitable zone with pebble snow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Pebble snow" describes a planet formation mechanism where icy pebbles in the outer disk reach inner planet embryos as the water ice line evolves inward. We model the effects pebble snow has on sculpting planetary system architectures by developing "The PPOLs Model". The model is capable of growing any number of protoplanet seed masses by pebble accretion simultaneously and accounts for differences in rocky and icy pebble composition, the filtering of pebbles by other protoplanets, the pebble isolation mass, and a self-consistently evolving snow line. The growth and bulk composition are recorded across a grid of protoplanetary disks with stellar masses ranging from 0.125 - 2.0${M_{\odot}}$ (M to A stars) and disk masses ranging from 1 - 40 % of the stellar mass. Three system architectures emerge following a low-, mid-, and high-disk mass fraction that remains consistent across stellar mass. The low-mass architecture is the only one to yield short period Mars-Earth mass cores with bulk water content spanning orders of magnitude and may be prelude to observed "peas in a pod" systems. The high-mass architecture produces proto-gas giant cores in the outer disk. The middle-mass architecture produces a bimodal peak in mass within a system, with the outer protoplanet mass at the snow line growing to an order of magnitude larger, resembling the Solar System. Solar system-like architectures appear for a small range of initial disk masses around F and G stars, but are not a common feature around K and M stars.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variations in HIP 41378: CHEOPS and TESS confirm a non-transiting sixth planet in the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.</description>

Abstract: The search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is a crucial step in understanding the processes driving atmosphere formation, retention, and loss. Past studies have revealed the existence of planets interior to the radius valley with densities lower than would be expected for pure-rock compositions, indicative of the presence of large volatile inventories which could facilitate atmosphere retention. Here we present an analysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq,{A_B}=0}$ = 569 K) super-Earth TOI-270 b ($R_\mathrm{p}$ = 1.306 $R_\oplus$), captured alongside the transit of TOI-270 d. The JWST white light-curve transit depth updates TOI-270 b's density to $\rho_\mathrm{p}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^3$, inconsistent at 4.4$\sigma$ with an Earth-like composition. Instead, the planet is best explained by a non-zero, percent-level water mass fraction, possibly residing on the surface or stored within the interior. The JWST transmission spectrum shows possible spectroscopic evidence for the presence of this water as part of an atmosphere on TOI-270 b, favoring a H$_2$O-rich steam atmosphere model over a flat spectrum ($\ln\mathcal{B}$ = $0.3-3.2$, inconclusive to moderate), with the exact significance depending on whether an offset parameter between the NIRSpec detectors is included. We leverage the transit of the twice-larger TOI-270 d crossing the stellar disk almost simultaneously to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the transit-light-source effect could have caused the water feature in TOI-270 b's observed transmission spectrum. Planetary evolution modeling furthermore shows that TOI-270 b could sustain a significant atmosphere on Gyr timescales, despite its high stellar irradiation, if it formed with a large initial volatile inventory.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging Explorations for Companions from the Subaru/IRD Strategic Program II; Discovery of a Brown-dwarf Companion around a Nearby mid-M~dwarf LSPM~J1446+4633</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a new directly-imaged brown dwarf companion with Keck/NIRC2+pyWFS around a nearby mid-type M~dwarf LSPM~J1446+4633 (hereafter J1446). The $L'$-band contrast ($4.5\times10^{-3}$) is consistent with a $\sim20-60\ M_{\rm Jup}$ object at 1--10~Gyr and our two-epoch NIRC2 data suggest a $\sim30\%$ ($\sim3.1\sigma)$ variability in its $L'$-band flux. We incorporated Gaia DR3 non-single-star catalog into the orbital fitting by combining the Subaru/IRD RV monitoring results, NIRC2 direct imaging results, and Gaia proper motion acceleration. As a result, we derive ${59.8}_{-1.4}^{+1.5}\ M_{\rm Jup}$ and $\approx4.3~{\rm au}$ for the dynamical mass and the semi-major axis of the companion J1446B, respectively. J1446B is one of the intriguing late-T~dwarfs showing variability at $L'$-band for future atmospheric studies with the constrained dynamical mass. Because the J1446 system is accessible with various observation techniques such as astrometry, direct imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy including radial velocity measurement, it has a potential as a great benchmark system to improve our understanding for cool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Update of the CODE catalogue and some aspects of the dynamical status of Oort Cloud comets</title>

Abstract: The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainty estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulated new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000\,au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10\,au from the Sun during this period, and over 80\% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7\,au.</description>

      <title>How stellar mass and disc size shape the formation and migration of super-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence rate of close-in super-Earths is higher around M-dwarfs compared to stars of higher masses. In this work we aim to understand how the super-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the protoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary disc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble accretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find that if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards migration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in super-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when viscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying migration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction of super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in a significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an increase in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features of the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced when the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer time-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time early on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case and viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for planets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection locations.</description>

      <title>Hydrocarbon Hazes on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-18b, a sub-Neptune orbiting in the habitable zone of an M dwarf, has attracted significant interest following observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and, more recently, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveal detectable atmospheric features. Previous studies have examined a wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared (0.8-5.2 $\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a planetary density of $\rho_P = 3.34 \pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a mean molecular weight of $\mu \sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets. Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze reduces the need for high-$\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour atmospheric temperatures $\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported, cooler solutions ($\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.</description>
