      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole scattering-induced temperature behaviour of HgTe-based semimetal quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semimetal quantum well (QW) based on HgTe structures exhibiting unusual transport properties at low temperature is examined experimentally. It demonstrates either a linear or quadratic growth of resistance with temperature at different top-gate voltages in the semimetal regime. We develop a theoretical model of HgTe-based semimetal QW resistance temperature dependence based on electron-hole scattering processes at low temperatures. We apply the Boltzmann transport equation approach to study the effect of electron-hole scattering in a semimetal QW. The calculated temperature behavior of 2D semimetal resistivity demonstrates an excellent agreement with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Moir\'e Trapped Biexcitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin heterostructures formed by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides can be used to create periodic moir\'e patterns. The emerging moir\'e potential can trap interlayer excitons into arrays of strongly interacting bosons, which form a unique platform to study strongly correlated many-body states. In order to create and manipulate these exotic phases of matter, a microscopic understanding of exciton-exciton interactions and their manifestation in these systems becomes indispensable. Recent density-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements have revealed novel spectral features indicating the formation of trapped multi-exciton states providing important information about the interaction strength. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to model the PL spectrum of trapped multi-exciton complexes focusing on the emission from moir\'e trapped single- and biexcitons. Based on an excitonic Hamiltonian we determine the properties of trapped biexcitons as function of twist angle and use these insights to predict the luminescence spectrum of moir\'e excitons for different densities. We demonstrate how side peaks resulting from transitions to excited states and a life time analysis can be utilized as indicators for moir\'e trapped biexcitons and provide crucial information about the excitonic interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Frequency and Multi-channel Output in Skyrmion Based Nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic nano-oscillators can generate tunable microwave signals that find a wide range of applications in the field of telecommunication to modern neuromorphic computing systems. Among other spintronic devices, a magnetic skyrmion is a promising candidate for the next generation of low-power devices due to its small size and topological stability. In this work, we propose a multi-channel oscillator design based on the synthetic anti-ferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmion pair. The mitigation of the skyrmion Hall effect in SAF and the associated decimation of the Magnus force endows the proposed oscillator with an ultra-high frequency of 41GHz and a multi-channel frequency output driven by the same current. The ultrahigh operational frequency represents an $\sim$342 times improvement compared to the monolayer single skyrmion oscillator featuring a constant uniaxial anisotropy profile. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed multi-channel oscillator design by introducing multi-channel nanotracks along with multiple skyrmions for enhanced frequency operation. The ultrahigh operational frequency and multi-channel output are attributed to three key factors: The oscillator design accounting for a finite spin-flip length of the spacer (such as Ru) material, tangential velocity proportionality on input spin current along with weak dependence on the radius of rotation of the skyrmion-pair, skyrmion interlocking in the channel enabled by the multi-channel high Ku rings and skyrmion-skyrmion repulsion, therefore resulting ultrahigh frequency and multi-channel outputs.</description>

      <title>Effects of dislocation filtering layers on optical properties of third telecom window emitting InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dots grown on silicon substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating light emitters based on III-V materials with silicon-based electronics is crucial for further increase in data transfer rates in communication systems since the indirect bandgap of silicon prevents its direct use as a light source. We investigate here InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown directly on 5{\deg} off-cut Si substrate and emitting light at 1.5 micrometers, compatible with established telecom platform. Using different dislocation defects filtering layers, exploiting strained superlattices and supplementary QD layers, we mitigate the effects of lattice constant and thermal expansion mismatches between III-V materials and Si during growth. Complementary optical spectroscopy techniques, i.e. photoreflectance and temperature-, time- and polarization- resolved photoluminescence, allow us to determine the optical quality and application potential of the obtained structures by comparing them to a reference sample -- state-of-the-art QDs grown on InP. Experimental findings are supported by calculations of excitonic states and optical transitions by combining multiband k.p and configuration-interaction methods. We show that our design of structures prevents the generation of a considerable density of defects, as intended. The emission of Si-based structures appears to be much broader than for the reference dots, due to the creation of different QD populations which might be a disadvantage in particular laser applications, however, could be favourable for others, e.g. in broadly tunable devices, sensors, or optical amplifiers. Eventually, we identify the overall most promising combination of defect filtering layers, discuss its advantages and limitations, and prospects for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid skin-topological effect induced by eight-site cells and arbitrary adjustment of the localization of topological edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) in non-Hermitian systems exhibits both the skin effect and topological protection, offering a novel mechanism for the localization of topological edge states (TESs) in electrons, circuits, and photons. However, it remains unclear whether the HSTE can be realized in quasicrystals, and the unique structure of quasicrystals with multi-site cells may provide novel localization phenomena for TESs induced by the HSTE. We propose an eight-site cell in two-dimensional quasicrystals and realize the HSTE with eight-site nonreciprocal intracell hoppings. Furthermore, we can arbitrarily adjust the eigenfield distributions of the TESs and discover domain walls associated with effective dissipation and their correlation with localization. We present a new scheme to precisely adjust the energy distribution in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with arbitrary polygonal outer boundaries.</description>

      <title>Photonic heat transport through a Josephson junction in a resistive environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments (Subero et. al. Nature Comm. $\bf{14}$, 7924 (2023)) we analyze photonic heat transport through a Josephson junction in a dissipative environment. For this purpose we derive the general expressions for the heat current in terms of non-equilibrium Green functions for the junction coupled in series or in parallel with two environmental impedances at different temperatures. We show that even on the insulating side of the Schmid transition the heat current is sensitive to the Josephson coupling exhibiting an opposite behavior for the series and parallel connection and in qualitative agreement with experiments. We also predict that this device should exhibit heat rectification properties and provide simple expressions to account for them in terms of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Femtojoule Resistive Switching in Nanoscale VO$_{2}$ Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-Moore computing technologies are expected to provide a sustainable alternative to the von Neumann approach not only due to their down-scaling potential but also via exploiting device-level functional complexity at the lowest possible energy consumption. The dynamics of the Mott transition in correlated electron oxides, such as vanadium dioxide, has been identified as a rich and reliable source of such functional complexity. However, its full potential in high-speed and low-power operation has been largely unexplored. We fabricated nanoscale VO$_{2}$ devices embedded in a broad-band test circuit to study the speed and energy limitations of their resistive switching operation. Our picosecond time-resolution, real-time resistive switching experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that tunable low-resistance states can be set by the application of 20~ps long, $&lt;$1.7~V amplitude voltage pulses at 15~ps incubation times and switching energies starting from a few femtojoule. Moreover, we demonstrate that at nanometer-scale device sizes not only the electric field induced insulator-to-metal transition, but also the thermal conduction limited metal-to-insulator transition can take place at timescales of 100's of picoseconds. These orders of magnitude breakthroughs open the route to the design of high-speed and low-power dynamical circuits for a plethora of neuromorphic computing applications from pattern recognition to numerical optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever increasing demand for computational power combined with the predicted plateau for the miniaturization of existing silicon-based technologies has made the search for low power alternatives an industrial and scientifically engaging problem. In this work, we explore spintronics-based Ising machines as hardware computation accelerators. We start by presenting the physical platforms on which this emerging field is being developed, the different control schemes and the type of algorithms and problems on which these machines outperform conventional computers. We then benchmark these technologies and provide an outlook for future developments and use-cases that can help them get a running start for integration into the next generation of computing devices.</description>

      <title>Record-high Anomalous Ettingshausen effect in a micron-sized magnetic Weyl semimetal on-chip cooler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state cooling devices offer compact, quiet, reliable and environmentally friendly solutions that currently rely primarily on the thermoelectric (TE) effect. Despite more than two centuries of research, classical thermoelectric coolers suffer from low efficiency which hampers wider application. In this study, the less researched Anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE), a transverse thermoelectric phenomenon, is presented as a new approach for on-chip cooling. This effect can be boosted in materials with non-trivial band topologies as demonstrated in the Heusler alloy $\text{Co}_2\text{MnGa}$. Enabled by the high quality of our material, in situ scanning thermal microscopy experiments reveal a record-breaking anomalous Ettingshausen coefficient of $-2.1$~mV in $\mu$m-sized on-chip cooling devices at room temperature. A significant 44\% of the effect is contributed by the intrinsic topological properties, in particular the Berry curvature of $\text{Co}_2\text{MnGa}$, emphasising the unique potential of magnetic Weyl semimetals for high-performance spot cooling in nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Ultraclean Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling a two-terminal Josephson junction to the stationary modes of the electromagnetic field produces the so-called Fiske resonances. Here, we propose another mechanism based on the exchange between the static Andreev bound states (ABS) and a nonequilibrium Fermi surface in an ultraclean multiterminal device. As a simple model, we consider an effective $S_a$-$N_{eff}$-$S_b$ double junction connecting the superconductors $S_a$ and $S_b$ to the infinite central normal metal $N_{eff}$. We find that the underlying microscopic process of phase-sensitive Andreev reflection (phase-AR) produces the possibility of an inversion, that is, the conductance can be larger at half-flux quantum than in zero field. The inversion-noninversion alternate as the bias voltage is increased. In addition, if the central region $N_{eff}$ is an integrable billiard connected to an infinite normal reservoir, we find that the standard ABS are replaced by one- and two-particle Andreev resonances that can be probed by the bias voltage. Finally, we find that, in the corresponding all-superconducting Andreev interferometer, the superconducting gap produces protection against the short relaxation time of the quasiparticle continua if the time periodic dynamics is treated as a perturbation. The spectrum of the two-particle resonances is then sparse inside the spectrum of the pairs of one-particle resonances. Our work supports the nonFloquet intrinsic resonances in two-dimensional metal-based Andreev interferometers, and challenges the Floquet theory of multiterminal Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>New opportunities in condensed matter physics for nanoscale quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre quantum sensors provide unique opportunities in studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive, physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in novel ways. Here we present a theoretical discussion on localized corner and edge states, as well as electronic properties emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological hopping parameter phase diagram is constructed from which different spatial localized states are identified following signatures of distinct fractal generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge states that carrier the details of the Sierpinski Carpet topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. When converted to effective magnetic fields, values on the order of tens of Teslas are easily reached.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport across a Josephson junction in a dissipative environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At zero temperature, a Josephson junction coupled to an ohmic environment displays a quantum phase transition between superconducting and insulating phases, depending whether the resistance of the environment is below or above the resistance quantum. At finite temperature, this so-called Schmid transition turns into a crossover. We determine the conditions under which the temperature dependence of the thermal conductance, which characterizes heat flow from a hot to cold resistor across the Josephson junction, displays universal scaling characteristic of the Schmid transition. We also discuss conditions for heat rectification to happen in the circuit. Our work can serve as a guide for identifying signatures of the Schmid transition in heat transport experiments.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Lattice Polaron in a Bose-Einstein Condensate of Hard-Core Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice polarons, quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an impurity and its surrounding bosonic environment confined to a lattice system, have emerged as a platform for generating complex few-body states, probing many-body phenomena, and addressing long-standing problems in physics. In this study, we employ a variational ansatz to investigate the quasiparticle and spectral properties of an impurity coupled to a condensate gas of hard-core bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice. Our findings demonstrate that the polaron features can be tuned by adjusting the filling factor of the bath, revealing intriguing polaron characteristics in the strongly interacting regime. These results offer valuable insights for lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases and can serve as a guide for new experiments in emergent quantum devices, such as moir\'e materials, where optical excitations can be described in terms of hard-core bosons.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Decoupling of Single Impurity Anderson Model through Auxiliary Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and, hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some aspects of the theory of fermions living on three dimensional spacetime with a flat co-dimension one boundary are discussed, particularly a case where the boundary condition preserves scale and translation invariance but violates the residual Lorentz and conformal symmetries. This case is interesting because the Dirac equation has normalizable stationary edge states which must be taken into account in the quantization. We show that a consequence of the edge states for quantization of the Dirac field is that there are no states of the Dirac field theory which are simultaneously scale, C and P invariant even when these are good symmetries of the theory. The scale invariant states of the Dirac field contain either a nonzero scale covariant momentum density or a U(1) charge density concentrated near the edge.</description>

Abstract: As the condensed matter analog of Majorana fermion, the Majorana zero-mode is well known as a building block of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. This review focuses on the recent progress of Majorana experiments, especially experiments about semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices. We first sketch Majorana zero-mode formation from a bottom-up view, which is more suitable for beginners and experimentalists. Then, we survey the status of zero-energy state signatures reported recently, from zero-energy conductance peaks, the oscillations, the quantization, and the interactions with extra degrees of freedom. We also give prospects of future experiments for advancing one-dimensional semiconductor nanowire-superconductor hybrid materials and devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the effects of driving a cavity at a large photon number in a circuit-QED experiment where the ``matter-like'' part corresponds to an unique Andreev level in a superconducting weak link. The three many-body states of the weak link, corresponding to the occupation of the Andreev level by 0, 1 or 2 quasiparticles, lead to different cavity frequency shifts. We show how the non-linearity inherited by the cavity from its coupling to the weak link affects the state discrimination and the photon number calibration. Both effects require treating the evolution of the driven system beyond the dispersive limit. In addition, we observe how transition rates between the circuit states (quantum and parity jumps) are affected by the microwave power, and compare the measurements with a theory accounting for the ``dressing'' of the Andreev states by the cavity.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space, the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we highlight the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state at filling factor $\nu=3/2$ in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <title>Dyakonov-Shur instability of electronic fluid: Spectral effect of weak magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically and analytically how the Dyakonov-Shur instability for a two-dimensional (2D) inviscid electronic fluid in a long channel can be affected by an external, out-of-plane static magnetic field. By linear stability analysis for a model based on the shallow-water equations, we describe the discrete spectrum of frequencies in the complex plane. When the fluid system is near the subsonic-to-supersonic transition point, a magnetically controlled gap between the stability and instability spectra of the complex eigen-frequencies is evident by our computations. This suggests that the passage from stability to instability (and vice versa) is no longer continuous in the effective Mach parameter of the boundary conditions. We connect this complex-valued gap to a multivalued function characterizing the exact electronic steady state. In a regime of weak magnetic fields, we derive a scaling law for the eigen-frequencies by perturbation theory. We discuss implications of our results in efforts to generate terahertz electromagnetic radiation by 2D electronic transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological theory of altermagnets, that captures their unique magnetization dynamics and allows modelling magnetic textures in this new magnetic phase. Focusing on the prototypical d-wave altermagnets, e.g. RuO$_2$, we can explain intuitively the characteristic lifted degeneracy of their magnon spectra, by the emergence of an effective sublattice-dependent anisotropic spin stiffness arising naturally from the phenomenological theory. We show that as a consequence the altermagnetic domain walls, in contrast to antiferromagnets, have a finite gradient of the magnetization, with its strength and gradient direction connected to the altermagnetic anisotropy, even for 180$^\circ$ domain walls. This gradient generates a ponderomotive force in the domain wall in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous external magnetic field, which may be achieved through magnetic force microscopy techniques. The motion of these altermagentic domain walls is also characterized by an anisotropic Walker breakdown, with much higher speed limits of propagation than ferromagnets but lower than antiferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

Abstract: Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental interest, and diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junction (ST-MTJ), in this work, we present non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based description of ST-MTJs both for N\'eel and Bloch textures, to capture the spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the ST-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetrical voltage dependence of spin torque. We delineate the voltage-induced rotation of the spin current texture, coupled with the appearance of helicity in spin current, particularly in the case of N\'eel skyrmions on MTJs. We describe the TMR roll-off in ST-MTJ with lower cross-sectional area and higher temperature based on transmission spectra analysis. We also introduce a computationally efficient coupled spatio-eigen framework of NEGF to address the 3D-NEGF requirement of the ST-MTJs. With analytical underpinning, we establish the generic nature of the spatio-eigen framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine-qua-non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that lack transnational invariance and simultaneous eigen-basis in the transverse directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.03061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InBi(001) is formed epitaxially on InAs(111)-A by depositing Bi on to an In-rich surface. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements reveal topological electronic surface states, close to the M bar high symmetry point. This demonstrates a heteroepitaxial system entirely in the III-V family with topological electronic properties. InBi shows coexistence of Bi and In surface terminations, in contradiction with other III-V materials. For the Bi termination, the study gives a consistent physical picture of the topological surface electronic structure of InBi(001) terminated by a Bi bilayer rather than a surface formed by splitting to a Bi monolayer termination. Theoretical calculations based on relativistic density functional theory and the one-step model of photoemission clarify the relationship between the InBi(001) surface termination and the topological surface states, supporting a predominant role of the Bi bilayer termination. Furthermore, a tight-binding model based on this Bi bilayer termination with only Bi-Bi hopping terms, and no Bi-In interaction, gives a deeper insight into the spin texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amperean superconductivity is an exotic phenomenon stemming from attractive effective electron-electron interactions (EEEIs) mediated by a transverse gauge field. Originally introduced in the context of quantum spin liquids and high-Tc superconductors, Amperean superconductivity has been recently proposed to occur at temperatures on the order of 1-20 K in two-dimensional, parabolic-band, electron gases embedded inside deep sub-wavelength optical cavities. In this work, we first generalize the microscopic theory of cavity-induced Amperean superconductivity to the case of graphene and then argue that this superconducting state cannot be achieved in the deep sub-wavelength regime. In the latter regime, indeed, a cavity induces only EEEIs between density fluctuations rather than the current-current interactions which are responsible for Amperean pairing.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Majorana bound states revealed by electron waiting times in a topological Andreev interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of waiting times of electron transfers has recently become experimentally accessible owing to advances in noninvasive probes working in the short-time regime. We study electron waiting times in a topological Andreev interferometer: a superconducting loop with controllable phase difference connected to a quantum spin Hall edge, where the edge state helicity enables the transfer of electrons and holes into separate leads, with transmission controlled by the loop's phase difference $\phi$. This setup features gapless Majorana bound states at $\phi=\pi$. The waiting times for electron transfers across the junction are sensitive to the presence of the gapless states, but are uncorrelated for all $\phi$. By contrast, at $\phi=\pi$ the waiting times of Andreev-scattered holes show a strong correlation and the crossed (hole-electron) distributions feature a unique behavior. Both effects exclusively result from the nonlocal properties of Majorana bound states. Consequently, electron waiting times and their correlations could circumvent some of the challenges for detecting topological superconductivity and Majorana states beyond conductance signatures.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a solid-state nanosensing paradigm. Specifically for high-precision magnetometry, the so-called Ramsey interferometry is the prevalent choice where the sensing signal is extracted from time-resolved spin-state-dependent photoluminescence (PL) data. Its sensitivity is ultimately limited by the photon shot noise, which cannot be sufficiently removed by averaging or frequency filtering. Here, we propose Ramsey DC magnetometry of a single NV center enhanced by a wavelet-denoising scheme specifically tailored to suppress photon shot noise. It simply operates as a classical post-processing applied on a collected PL time series. Our implementation is based on a method that we named template margin thresholding which enables not only frequency but also time-dependent denoising. We computationally benchmark its DC magnetic field sensing signal-to-noise-ratio improvement over the raw PL data around an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Magnetointerferometry of multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: We report a theoretical study of multiterminal Josephson junctions under the influence of a magnetic field $B$. We consider a ballistic rectangular two-dimensional metal $N_0$ connected by the edges to the left, right, top and bottom superconductors $S_L$, $S_R$, $S_T$ and $S_B$, respectively. We numerically calculate in the large-gap approximation the critical current $I_c$ versus $B$ between the left and right $S_L$ and $S_R$ for various aspect ratios, with the top and bottom $S_T$ and $S_B$ playing the role of superconducting mirrors. We find the critical current $I_c$ to be enhanced by orders of magnitude, especially at long distance, due to the phase rigidity provided by the mirrors. We obtain superconducting quantum interference device-like magnetic oscillations. With symmetric couplings, the self-consistent superconducting phase variables of the top and bottom mirrors take the values $0$ or $\pi$, as for emerging Ising degrees of freedom. We propose a simple effective Josephson junction circuit model that is compatible with these microscopic numerical calculations. From the $I_c(B)$ patterns we infer where the supercurrent flows in various device geometries. In particular in the elongated geometry, we show that the supercurrent flows between all pairs of contacts, which allows exploring the full phase space of the relevant phase differences.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Kitaev chains</title>

Abstract: The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological features.</description>
