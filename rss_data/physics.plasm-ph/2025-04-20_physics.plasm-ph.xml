      <title>Machine-learning Closure for Vlasov-Poisson Dynamics in Fourier-Hermite Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reduced models of turbulence are desirable to facilitate the optimization of magnetic-confinement fusion reactor designs. As a first step toward higher-dimensional turbulence applications, we use reservoir computing, a machine-learning (ML) architecture, to develop a closure model for a limiting case of electrostatic gyrokinetics. We implement a pseudo-spectral Eulerian code to solve the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system on a basis of Fourier modes in configuration space and Hermite polynomials in velocity space. When cast onto the Hermite basis, the Vlasov equation becomes an infinitely coupled hierarchy of fluid moments, presenting a closure problem. We exploit the locality of interactions in the Hermite representation to introduce an ML closure model of the small-scale dynamics in velocity space. In the linear limit, when the kinetic Fourier-Hermite solver is augmented with the reservoir closure, the closure permits a reduction of the velocity resolution, with a relative error within two percent for the Hermite moment where the reservoir closes the hierarchy. In the strongly-nonlinear regime, the ML closure model more accurately resolves the low-order Fourier and Hermite spectra when compared to a na\"{i}ve closure by truncation and reduces the required velocity resolution by a factor of sixteen.</description>

      <title>Foundations of magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial, a derivation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) valid beyond the usual ideal gas approximation is presented. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used to obtain conservation equations and linear constitutive relations. When coupled with Maxwell's equations, this provides closed fluid equations in terms of material properties of the plasma, described by the equation of state and transport coefficients. These properties are connected to microscopic dynamics using the Irving-Kirkwood procedure and Green-Kubo relations. Symmetry arguments and the Onsager-Casimir relations allow one to vastly simplify the number of independent coefficients. Importantly, expressions for current density, heat flux, and stress (conventionally Ohm's law, Fourier's law, and Newton's law) take different forms in systems with a non-ideal equation of state. The traditional form of the MHD equations, which is usually obtained from a Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation, corresponds to the ideal gas limit of the general equations.</description>

      <title>A generalized equation for the critical current for a one-dimensional crossed-field gap in an orthogonal coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to extend the one-dimensional SCLC from planar gaps to more complicated geometries. However, introducing a magnetic field orthogonal to the diode's electric field complicates these calculations due to changes in the electron trajectory. This paper extends a recent study that applied variational calculus to determine the SCLC for a cylindrical crossed-field diode to derive an equation that is valid for any orthogonal coordinate system. We then derive equations for the SCLC for crossed-field gaps in spherical, tip-to-tip, and tip-to-plane geometries that can be solved numerically. These calculations exhibit a discontinuity at the Hull cutoff magnetic field $B_H$ corresponding to the transition to magnetic insulation as observed analytically for a planar geometry. The ratio of the crossed-field SCLC to the nonmagnetic SCLC becomes essentially independent of geometry when we fix $\delta = D/D_M &gt; 0.6$, where $D$ is the canonical gap distance accounting for geometric effects on electric potential and $D_M$ is the effective gap distance that accounts for magnetic field and geometry. The solutions for these geometries overlap as $\delta \to 1$ since the geometric corrections for electric potential and magnetic field match. This indicates the possibility of more generally accounting for the combination of geometric and magnetic effects when calculating $B_H$ and SCLC.</description>

      <title>Static linear density response from X-ray Thomson scattering measurements: a case study of warm dense beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear response theory is ubiquitous throughout physics and plays a central role in the theoretical description of warm dense matter -- an extreme state that occurs within compact astrophysical objects and that is traversed on the compression path of a fuel capsule in inertial confinement fusion applications. Here we show how one can relate the static linear density response function to X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements, which opens up new possibilities for the diagnostics of extreme states of matter, and for the rigorous assessment and verification of theoretical models and approximations. As a practical example, we consider an XRTS data set of warm dense beryllium taken at the National Ignition Facility [T.~D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. The comparison with state-of-the-art \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature Commun.}~(in print), arXiv:2402.19113] gives us a best estimate of the mass density of $\rho=18\pm6\,$g/cc, which is consistent with previous PIMC and density functional theory based studies, but rules out the original estimate of $\rho=34\pm4\,$g/cc based on a Chihara model fit.</description>

      <title>Formation of Magnetic Switchbacks via expanding Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Large-amplitude inversions of the solar wind's interplanetary magnetic field have long been documented; however, observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission have renewed interest in this phenomenon as such features, often termed switchbacks, may constrain both the sources of the solar wind as well as in-situ nonlinear dynamics and turbulent heating. Aims. We aim to show that magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are consistent with Alfv\'enic fluctuations that naturally form switchback inversions in the magnetic field through expansion effects. Methods. We examine PSP observations of the evolution of a single stream of solar wind in a radial scan from PSP's tenth perihelion encounter from approximately 15-50 solar radii. We study the growth and radial scaling of normalized fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, within the framework of spherical polarization. We compare heating rates computed via outer-scale decay from consideration of wave-action to proton heating rates empirically observed through considering adiabatic expansion. Results. We find that the magnetic field fluctuations are largely spherically polarized and that the normalized amplitudes of the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, increases with amplitude. The growth of the magnetic field amplitude leads to switchback inversions in the magnetic field. While the amplitudes do not grow as fast as predicted by the conservation of wave action, the deviation from the expected scaling yields an effective heating rate, which is close to the empirically observed proton heating rate. Conclusions. The observed scaling of fluctuation amplitudes is largely consistent with a picture of expanding Alfv\'en waves that seed turbulence leading to dissipation. The expansion of the waves leads to the growth of wave-amplitudes, resulting in the formation of switchbacks.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by the monochromatic radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encountered a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the 'secondary' Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks--Dattner resonances.</description>
