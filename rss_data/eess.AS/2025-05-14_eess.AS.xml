      <title>MiniMax-Speech: Intrinsic Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with a Learnable Speaker Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MiniMax-Speech, an autoregressive Transformer-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality speech. A key innovation is our learnable speaker encoder, which extracts timbre features from a reference audio without requiring its transcription. This enables MiniMax-Speech to produce highly expressive speech with timbre consistent with the reference in a zero-shot manner, while also supporting one-shot voice cloning with exceptionally high similarity to the reference voice. In addition, the overall quality of the synthesized audio is enhanced through the proposed Flow-VAE. Our model supports 32 languages and demonstrates excellent performance across multiple objective and subjective evaluations metrics. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on objective voice cloning metrics (Word Error Rate and Speaker Similarity) and has secured the top position on the public TTS Arena leaderboard. Another key strength of MiniMax-Speech, granted by the robust and disentangled representations from the speaker encoder, is its extensibility without modifying the base model, enabling various applications such as: arbitrary voice emotion control via LoRA; text to voice (T2V) by synthesizing timbre features directly from text description; and professional voice cloning (PVC) by fine-tuning timbre features with additional data. We encourage readers to visit https://minimax-ai.github.io/tts_tech_report for more examples.</description>

      <title>Investigating self-supervised features for expressive, multilingual voice conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) systems are widely used for several applications, from speaker anonymisation to personalised speech synthesis. Supervised approaches learn a mapping between different speakers using parallel data, which is expensive to produce. Unsupervised approaches are typically trained to reconstruct the input signal, which is composed of the content and the speaker information. Disentangling these components is a challenge and often leads to speaker leakage or prosodic information removal. In this paper, we explore voice conversion by leveraging the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL). A combination of the latent representations of SSL models, concatenated with speaker embeddings, is fed to a vocoder which is trained to reconstruct the input. Zero-shot voice conversion results show that this approach allows to keep the prosody and content of the source speaker while matching the speaker similarity of a VC system based on phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs).</description>

      <title>A Survey of Deep Learning for Complex Speech Spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly impacted the field of speech signal processing, particularly in the analysis and manipulation of complex spectrograms. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques leveraging deep neural networks for processing complex spectrograms, which encapsulate both magnitude and phase information. We begin by introducing complex spectrograms and their associated features for various speech processing tasks. Next, we explore the key components and architectures of complex-valued neural networks, which are specifically designed to handle complex-valued data and have been applied for complex spectrogram processing. We then discuss various training strategies and loss functions tailored for training neural networks to process and model complex spectrograms. The survey further examines key applications, including phase retrieval, speech enhancement, and speech separation, where deep learning has achieved significant progress by leveraging complex spectrograms or their derived feature representations. Additionally, we examine the intersection of complex spectrograms with generative models. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of speech signal processing and complex-valued neural networks.</description>

      <title>Granite-speech: open-source speech-aware LLMs with strong English ASR capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08699v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granite-speech LLMs are compact and efficient speech language models specifically designed for English ASR and automatic speech translation (AST). The models were trained by modality aligning the 2B and 8B parameter variants of granite-3.3-instruct to speech on publicly available open-source corpora containing audio inputs and text targets consisting of either human transcripts for ASR or automatically generated translations for AST. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that on English ASR, which was our primary focus, they outperform several competitors' models that were trained on orders of magnitude more proprietary data, and they keep pace on English-to-X AST for major European languages, Japanese, and Chinese. The speech-specific components are: a conformer acoustic encoder using block attention and self-conditioning trained with connectionist temporal classification, a windowed query-transformer speech modality adapter used to do temporal downsampling of the acoustic embeddings and map them to the LLM text embedding space, and LoRA adapters to further fine-tune the text LLM. Granite-speech-3.3 operates in two modes: in speech mode, it performs ASR and AST by activating the encoder, projector, and LoRA adapters; in text mode, it calls the underlying granite-3.3-instruct model directly (without LoRA), essentially preserving all the text LLM capabilities and safety. Both models are freely available on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-speech-3.3-2b and https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-speech-3.3-8b) and can be used for both research and commercial purposes under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.</description>

      <title>Fast Text-to-Audio Generation with Adversarial Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08175v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Not that Groove: Zero-Shot Symbolic Music Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most work in AI music generation focused on audio, which has seen limited use in the music production industry due to its rigidity. To maximize flexibility while assuming only textual instructions from producers, we are among the first to tackle symbolic music editing. We circumvent the known challenge of lack of labeled data by proving that LLMs with zero-shot prompting can effectively edit drum grooves. The recipe of success is a creatively designed format that interfaces LLMs and music, while we facilitate evaluation by providing an evaluation dataset with annotated unit tests that highly aligns with musicians' judgment.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Best Practices for Applying Speech Foundation Models to Speech Intelligibility Prediction for Hearing-Impaired People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of downstream tasks, including speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired people (SIP-HI). However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally, temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance. Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.</description>

      <title>M3G: Multi-Granular Gesture Generator for Audio-Driven Full-Body Human Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio. However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating natural and expressive full-body human gestures.</description>

      <title>A Mamba-based Network for Semi-supervised Singing Melody Extraction Using Confidence Binary Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing melody extraction (SME) is a key task in the field of music information retrieval. However, existing methods are facing several limitations: firstly, prior models use transformers to capture the contextual dependencies, which requires quadratic computation resulting in low efficiency in the inference stage. Secondly, prior works typically rely on frequencysupervised methods to estimate the fundamental frequency (f0), which ignores that the musical performance is actually based on notes. Thirdly, transformers typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal performances, but the SME task lacks of sufficient annotated data. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a mamba-based network, called SpectMamba, for semi-supervised singing melody extraction using confidence binary regularization. In particular, we begin by introducing vision mamba to achieve computational linear complexity. Then, we propose a novel note-f0 decoder that allows the model to better mimic the musical performance. Further, to alleviate the scarcity of the labeled data, we introduce a confidence binary regularization (CBR) module to leverage the unlabeled data by maximizing the probability of the correct classes. The proposed method is evaluated on several public datasets and the conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a certain remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of Cohn's four hexatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading and extended harmony, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show that analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>A Classification Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence Detection of Laryngeal Cancer from Patient Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cases of laryngeal cancer are predicted to rise significantly in the coming years. Current diagnostic pathways are inefficient, putting undue stress on both patients and the medical system. Artificial intelligence offers a promising solution by enabling non-invasive detection of laryngeal cancer from patient voice, which could help prioritise referrals more effectively. A major barrier in this field is the lack of reproducible methods. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a benchmark suite comprising 36 models trained and evaluated on open-source datasets. These models classify patients with benign and malignant voice pathologies. All models are accessible in a public repository, providing a foundation for future research. We evaluate three algorithms and three audio feature sets, including both audio-only inputs and multimodal inputs incorporating demographic and symptom data. Our best model achieves a balanced accuracy of 83.7%, sensitivity of 84.0%, specificity of 83.3%, and AUROC of 91.8%.</description>

      <title>ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

      <title>BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal learning, with successful applications in text generation and speech synthesis, enabling a deeper understanding and generation of multimodal content. In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</description>
