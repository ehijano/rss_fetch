      <title>Using Cosmic Rays to Predict the Weather: Meteorological Data Assimilation of Atmospheric Muon Flux Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical weather prediction requires initial estimates of the atmospheric state. Since the atmospheric density field is intricately woven into the atmosphere's governing equations, advancing atmospheric density estimation will improve numerical weather prediction. However, current meteorological instrumentation cannot directly measure the atmospheric density field over large volumes. Existing techniques rely on sparse point measurements, limiting our ability to accurately estimate the three-dimensional atmospheric density field. One potential solution is to employ measurements of the atmospheric muon flux. Atmospheric muons are particles produced when energetic atomic nuclei (cosmic rays) collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing a shower of secondary particles (muons) that propagates to the Earth's surface. The surface atmospheric muon flux is known to be proportional to the local atmospheric density field, implying that this technique can be used as a measurement of atmospheric density. This study examines the potential for using atmospheric muon flux measurements to improve atmospheric state estimation via a case study of simulated atmospheric muon observations in the path of tropical cyclone Freddy. We show that improvement in data assimilation performance can be achieved using data from a relatively small astroparticle detector, well within the capabilities of existing astroparticle technology. We additionally show that the improvements to atmospheric state estimates associated with muon flux assimilation are at least partially unique to muon flux measurements, as comparable surface pressure point measurements do not reproduce a similar effect.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Global Land Surface Temperature Retrieval via a Coupled Mechanism-Machine Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is vital for land-atmosphere interactions and climate processes. Accurate LST retrieval remains challenging under heterogeneous land cover and extreme atmospheric conditions. Traditional split window (SW) algorithms show biases in humid environments; purely machine learning (ML) methods lack interpretability and generalize poorly with limited data. We propose a coupled mechanism model-ML (MM-ML) framework integrating physical constraints with data-driven learning for robust LST retrieval. Our approach fuses radiative transfer modeling with data components, uses MODTRAN simulations with global atmospheric profiles, and employs physics-constrained optimization. Validation against 4,450 observations from 29 global sites shows MM-ML achieves MAE=1.84K, RMSE=2.55K, and R-squared=0.966, outperforming conventional methods. Under extreme conditions, MM-ML reduces errors by over 50%. Sensitivity analysis indicates LST estimates are most sensitive to sensor radiance, then water vapor, and less to emissivity, with MM-ML showing superior stability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our coupled modeling strategy for retrieving geophysical parameters. The MM-ML framework combines physical interpretability with nonlinear modeling capacity, enabling reliable LST retrieval in complex environments and supporting climate monitoring and ecosystem studies.</description>

      <title>Detecting extreme event-driven causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of some extreme events (such as marine heatwaves or exceptional circulations) can cause other extreme events (such as heatwave, drought and flood). These concurrent extreme events have a great impact on environment and human health. However, how to detect and quantify the causes and impacts of these extreme events by a data-driven way is still unsolved. In this study, the dynamic system method is extended to develop a method for detecting the causality between extreme events. Taking the coupled Lorenz-Lorenz systems with extreme event-driven coupling as an example, it is demonstrated that this proposed detecting method is able to capture the extreme event-driven causality, with even better causality detecting performance between concurrent extreme events. Comparison among three kinds of measured series, full measurements outperform partial ones in event-to-event causality detecting. The successful applicability of our proposed approach in Walker circulation phenomenon indicates that our method contributes a novel way to the study of causal inference in complex systems. This method offers valuable insights into multi-scale, nonlinear dynamics, particularly in uncovering associations among extreme events.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length or surface roughness, z0, of ocean waves is developed and tested. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length (SWARL) model requires maps of the wave surface height at consecutive times and the air flow characteristic Reynolds number as inputs. Pressure drag is accounted for by approximating the relative velocity in a frame moving with the local wave phase-speed assuming ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al. 2024). Drag from viscous and unresolved ripples is modeled using the standard equilibrium model. The SWARL model is tested using over 300 datasets for monochromatic and broad-spectrum wave surfaces. The model-predicted z0 and drag coefficients are compared to measured values, as well as commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. For datasets with well-characterized surfaces, the proposed model shows significantly better agreement with data compared to prior models. For data that did not include a full characterization of the wave fields (typically field data), the model yields predictions with accuracy similar to prior models. Results highlight that including detailed flow physics and extensive wave-field characterization in the modeling of z0 can provide significant improvements in roughness-length based modeling of air-sea interactions.</description>

      <title>Global stability of the Atlantic overturning circulation: Edge states, long transients and a boundary crisis under CO$_2$ forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a crucial ocean current system, could transition to a weak state. Despite severe associated climate impacts, assessing the AMOC's response under global warming and its proximity to possible critical thresholds remains difficult. To understand future Earth system stability, a global dynamical view is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying classical early-warning methods. Using an intermediate-complexity climate model, we explore the stability landscape of the AMOC for different atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. We explicitly compute the edge state (or Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle on the basin boundary separating the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries, supporting centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. At increased CO$_2$ levels projected for the near future, we reveal a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor disappears by colliding with the edge state. Under crisis overshoot, long chaotic transients due to "ghost states" lead to diverging ensemble trajectories under time-varying forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an explanation of large ensemble variance and apparent "stochastic bifurcations" observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Two-Dimensional, Multi-Frequency Propagation Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.</description>
