      <title>LLM-Find: An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes LLM-Find, an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of selecting and fetching required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. LLM-Find utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add a new data source by adding a new handbook. We developed a prototype agent based on LLM-Find, and experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, weather data from a commercial provider, and the COVID-19 data from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

      <title>Self-Sovereign Identity for Consented and Content-Based Access to Medical Records using Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Medical Data are classified as personal data in every privacy law, meaning that any related service that includes processing such data must come with full security, confidentiality, privacy and accountability. Solutions for health data management, as in storing it, sharing and processing it, are emerging quickly and were significantly boosted by the Covid-19 pandemic that created a need to move things online. EHRs makes a crucial part of digital identity data, and the same digital identity trends -- as in self sovereign identity powered by decentralized ledger technologies like Blockchain, are being researched or implemented in contexts managing digital interactions between health facilities, patients and health professionals. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution enabling secure exchange of EHRs between different parties powered by a self-sovereign identity (SSI) wallet and decentralized identifiers. We also make use of a consortium IPFS network for off-chain storage and attribute-based encryption (ABE) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Through our solution, we grant users full control over their medical data, and enable them to securely share it in total confidentiality over secure communication channels between user wallets using encryption. We also use DIDs for better user privacy and limit any possible correlations or identification by using pairwise DIDs. Overall, combining this set of technologies guarantees secure exchange of EHRs, secure storage and management along with by-design features inherited from the technological stack.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Vision Transformer with Transfer Learning Combined with Support Vector Machine Based Efficient Drought Stress Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.</description>

      <title>Stochastic models of memristive behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under normal operations, memristive devices undergo variability in time and space and have internal dynamics. Interplay of memory and stochastic signal processing in memristive devices makes them candidates for performing bio-inspired tasks of information transduction and transformation, where intrinsic random behavior can be harnessed for high performance of circuits built up of individual memory storing elements. The paper discusses models of single memristive devices exhibiting both - dynamic hysteresis and Stochastic Resonance, addressing also the cooperative effect of correlated noises acting on the system and occurrence of dirty hysteretic rounding.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Understand Computer Networks? Towards a Virtual System Administrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising prospects for aiding system administrators in managing the complexity of modern networks. However, despite this potential, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the extent to which LLMs can understand computer networks. Without empirical evidence, system administrators might rely on these models without assurance of their efficacy in performing network-related tasks accurately.
  In this paper, we are the first to conduct an exhaustive study on LLMs' comprehension of computer networks. We formulate several research questions to determine whether LLMs can provide correct answers when supplied with a network topology and questions on it. To assess them, we developed a thorough framework for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in various network-related tasks. We evaluate our framework on multiple computer networks employing proprietary (e.g., GPT4) and open-source (e.g., Llama2) models. Our findings in general purpose LLMs using a zero-shot scenario demonstrate promising results, with the best model achieving an average accuracy of 79.3%. Proprietary LLMs achieve noteworthy results in small and medium networks, while challenges persist in comprehending complex network topologies, particularly for open-source models. Moreover, we provide insight into how prompt engineering can enhance the accuracy of some tasks.</description>
