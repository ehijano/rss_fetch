      <title>Information Capacity of EEG: Theoretical and Computational Limits of Recoverable Neural Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to study human brain dynamics, yet its quantitative information capacity remains unclear. Here, we combine information theory and synthetic forward modeling to estimate the mutual information between latent cortical sources and EEG recordings. Using Gaussian-channel theory and empirical simulations, we find that scalp EEG conveys only tens of bits per sample about low-dimensional neural activity. Information saturates with approximately 64-128 electrodes and scales logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Linear decoders capture nearly all variance that is linearly recoverable, but the mutual information they recover remains far below the analytic channel capacity, indicating that measurement physics - not algorithmic complexity - is the dominant limitation. These results outline the intrinsic ceiling on how much structure about brain state or thought content can be inferred from EEG.</description>

      <title>Performance of Modified Fractional Frequency Reuse Algorithm in Random Ultra Dense Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating intercell interference by employing fractional frequency reuse algorithms is one of the important approaches to improving user performance in 5G and Beyond 5G cellular network systems, which typically have a high density of Base Stations (BSs). While most frequency reuse algorithms are based on the downlink Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) or the distance between the user and its serving BS to classify Cell-Edge Users (CEUs) and Cell-Center Users (CCUs), this paper discusses a modified algorithm that uses the power ratio between the signal strengths from the serving BS and the second nearest BS for user classification. Specifically, if the power ratio is below a predefined threshold, the user is classified as a CEU and is served with higher transmission power. Simulation results show that increasing transmission power is necessary to enhance CEU performance, but it also degrades the performance of typical users. The use of frequency reuse algorithms is particularly feasible in environments with a high density of obstacles, where intercell interference can be effectively suppressed.</description>

      <title>A Markov-Chain Characterization of Finite-State Dimension and a Generalization of Agafonov's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-state dimension quantifies the asymptotic rate of information in an infinite sequence as perceived by finite automata. For a fixed alphabet, the infinite sequences that have maximal finite-state dimension are exactly those that are Borel normal, i.e., in which all words of any given length appear with the same frequency. A theorem of Schnorr and Stimm (1972) shows that a real number is Borel normal if and only if, for every finite-state irreducible Markov chain with fair transitions, when the chain is simulated using the binary expansion of the given number, the empirical distribution of states converges to its stationary distribution. In this paper we extend this correspondence beyond normal numbers. We show that the finite-state dimension of a sequence can be characterized in terms of the conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence between the limiting distributions arising from the simulation of Markov chains using the given sequence and their stationary distributions. This provides a new information-theoretic characterization of finite-state dimension which generalizes the Schnorr-Stimm result.
  As an application, we prove a generalization of Agafonov's theorem for normal numbers. Agafonov's theorem states that a sequence is normal if and only if every subsequence selected by a finite automaton is also normal. We extend this to arbitrary sequences by establishing a tight quantitative relationship between the finite-state dimension of a sequence and the finite-state dimensions of its automatic subsequences.</description>

      <title>Single-Snapshot Gridless 2D-DoA Estimation for UCAs: A Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of gridless two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a uniform circular array (UCA) from a single snapshot of data. Conventional gridless methods often fail in this scenario due to prohibitive computational costs or a lack of robustness. We propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by jointly estimating a manifold transformation matrix and the source azimuth-elevation pairs within a single, unified optimization problem. This problem is solved efficiently using an inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (iALM), which completely circumvents the need for semidefinite programming. By unifying the objectives of data fidelity and transformation robustness, our approach is uniquely suited for the demanding single-snapshot case. Simulation results confirm that the proposed iALM framework provides robust and high-resolution, gridless 2D-DOA estimates, establishing its efficacy for challenging array signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Covariance Matrix Construction with Preprocessing-Based Spatial Sampling for Robust Adaptive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an efficient, robust adaptive beamforming technique to deal with steering vector (SV) estimation mismatches and data covariance matrix reconstruction problems. In particular, the direction-of-arrival(DoA) of interfering sources is estimated with available snapshots in which the angular sectors of the interfering signals are computed adaptively. Then, we utilize the well-known general linear combination algorithm to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix using preprocessing-based spatial sampling (PPBSS). We demonstrate that the preprocessing matrix can be replaced by the sample covariance matrix (SCM) in the shrinkage method. A power spectrum sampling strategy is then devised based on a preprocessing matrix computed with the estimated angular sectors' information. Moreover, the covariance matrix for the signal is formed for the angular sector of the signal-of-interest (SOI), which allows for calculating an SV for the SOI using the power method. An analysis of the array beampattern in the proposed PPBSS technique is carried out, and a study of the computational cost of competing approaches is conducted. Simulation results show the proposed method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient IRS-Assisted UAV Spectrum Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework. Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for tensor factorization by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control over operation order built from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\rm fixed}^*$, yielding an explicit, analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\rm switch}(\omega)-p_{\rm fixed}^*$. We prove that $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ is achievable, thereby certifying causal non-separability by purely algebraic means, and confirm this behaviour numerically. Conceptually, this furnishes a minimal non-Abelian $B_3$ control for a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of nonmonotonic quantum natural gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role.
  Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics.
  While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quantization of information-theoretic quantities introduces inherent arbitrariness.
  To resolve this ambiguity, monotonicity has been used as a guiding principle for constructing geometries in physics, as it aligns with physical intuition.
  Recently, a variant of QNG, which we refer to as nonmonotonic QNG in this paper, was proposed by relaxing the monotonicity condition.
  It was shown to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional QNG.
  In this paper, we investigate the properties of nonmonotonic QNG.
  To ensure the paper is self-contained, we first demonstrate that the SLD metric is locally optimal under the monotonicity condition and that non-monotone quantum Fisher metrics can lead to faster convergence in QNG.
  Previous studies primarily relied on a specific type of quantum divergence and assumed that density operators are full-rank.
  Here, we explicitly consider an alternative quantum divergence and extend the analysis to non-full-rank cases.
  Additionally, we explore how geometries can be designed using Petz functions, given that quantum Fisher metrics are characterized through them.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations comparing different quantum Fisher metrics in the context of parameter estimation problems in quantum circuit learning.</description>

      <title>LatticeHashForest: An Efficient Data Structure for Repetitive Data and Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of entire programs as a single unit, or whole-program analysis, involves propagation of large amounts of information through the control flow of the program. This is especially true for pointer analysis, where, unless significant compromises are made in the precision of the analysis, there is a combinatorial blowup of information. One of the key problems we observed in our own efforts is that a lot of duplicate data was being propagated, and many low-level data structure operations were repeated a large number of times.
  We present what we consider to be a novel and generic data structure, LatticeHashForest (LHF), to store and operate on such information in a manner that eliminates a majority of redundant computations and duplicate data in scenarios similar to those encountered in compilers and program optimization. LHF differs from similar work in this vein, such as hash-consing, ZDDs, and BDDs, by not only providing a way to efficiently operate on large, aggregate structures, but also modifying the elements of such structures in a manner that they can be deduplicated immediately. LHF also provides a way to perform a nested construction of elements such that they can be deduplicated at multiple levels, cutting down the need for additional, nested computations.
  We provide a detailed structural description, along with an abstract model of this data structure. An entire C++ implementation of LHF is provided as an artifact along with evaluations of LHF using examples and benchmark programs. We also supply API documentation and a user manual for users to make independent applications of LHF. Our main use case in the realm of pointer analysis shows memory usage reduction to an almost negligible fraction, and speedups beyond 4x for input sizes approaching 10 million when compared to other implementations.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Binomial Multiples of Polynomials over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f(X)$ be a nonconstant polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, with a nonzero constant term. The order of $f(X)$ is a classical notion in the theory of polynomials over finite fields, and recently the definition of freeness of binomials of $f(X)$ was given in \cite{Mart\'{i}nez}. Generalizing these two notions, we introduce the definition of the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ in this paper, which is the monic binomial with the lowest degree among the binomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ divided by $f(X)$. Based on the equivalent characterization of binomials via the defining sets of their radicals, we prove that a series of properties of the classical order can be naturally generalized to this case. In particular, the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ is presented explicitly in terms of the defining set of the radical of $f(X)$. And a criterion for $f(X)$ being free of binomials is given. As an application, for any positive integer $N$ and nonzero element $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $N$ with minimal distance $2$ are determined.</description>

      <title>Undirected Multicast Network Coding Gaps via Locally Decodable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network coding problem asks whether data throughput in a network can be increased using coding (compared to treating bits as commodities in a flow). While it is well-known that a network coding advantage exists in directed graphs, the situation in undirected graphs is much less understood -- in particular, despite significant effort, it is not even known whether network coding is helpful at all for unicast sessions.
  In this paper we study the multi-source multicast network coding problem in undirected graphs. There are $k$ sources broadcasting each to a subset of nodes in a graph of size $n$. The corresponding combinatorial problem is a version of the Steiner tree packing problem, and the network coding question asks whether the multicast coding rate exceeds the tree-packing rate.
  We give the first super-constant bound to this problem, demonstrating an example with a coding advantage of $\Omega(\log k)$. In terms of graph size, we obtain a lower bound of $2^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log \log n})}$. We also obtain an upper bound of $O(\log n)$ on the gap.
  Our main technical contribution is a new reduction that converts locally-decodable codes in the low-error regime into multicast coding instances. This gives rise to a new family of explicitly constructed graphs, which may have other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme requirements for high reliability and low latency in the upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) wireless networks are challenging the design of multi-hop wireless transport networks. Inspired by the advent of the virtualization concept in the wireless networks design and openness paradigm as fostered by the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance, we target a revolutionary resource allocation scheme to improve the overall transmission efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic repeat request (ARQ) in multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, and propose a dynamic scheme of multi-hop hybrid ARQ (HARQ), which maximizes the end-to-end (E2E) communication reliability in the wireless transport network. We also propose an integer dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal Dynamic Multi-Hop HARQ (DMH-HARQ) strategy. Constrained within a certain time frame to accomplish E2E transmission, our proposed approach is proven to outperform the conventional listening-based cooperative ARQ, as well as any static HARQ strategy, regarding the E2E reliability. It is applicable without dependence on special delay constraint, and is particularly competitive for long-distance transport network with many hops.</description>

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), which consists of multiple layers of intelligent metasurfaces, is emerging as a promising solution for future wireless communication systems. In this timely context, we focus on broadcast multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and aim to characterize their energy efficiency (EE) performance. To explore the potential of SIM, we consider both dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear precoding (LP) and formulate the corresponding EE maximization problems. For DPC, we employ the broadcast channel (BC)-multiple-access channel (MAC) duality to obtain an equivalent problem, and optimize users' covariance matrices using the successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach's methods. Since the phase shift optimization problem of the SIM meta-elements is one of extremely large size, we adopt a conventional projected gradient-based method for its simplicity. A similar approach is followed for the case of LP. Simulation results show that the proposed optimization methods for the considered SIM-based systems can significantly improve the EE, compared to conventional counterparts. Also, we demonstrate that the number of SIM meta-elements and their distribution across the SIM layers have a significant impact on both the achievable sum-rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Gradient-MUSIC for spectral estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for estimating the unknown frequencies and amplitudes of a nonharmonic signal from noisy time samples. While the classical MUSIC algorithm performs a computationally expensive search over a fine grid, Gradient-MUSIC is significantly more efficient and eliminates the need for discretization over a fine grid by using optimization techniques. It coarsely scans the 1D landscape to find initialization simultaneously for all frequencies followed by parallelizable local refinement via gradient descent. We also analyze its performance when the noise level is sufficiently small and the signal frequencies are separated by at least $8\pi/m$, where $\pi/m$ is the standard resolution of this problem. Even though the 1D landscape is nonconvex, we prove a global convergence result for Gradient-MUSIC: coarse scanning provably finds suitable initialization and gradient descent converges at a linear rate. In addition to convergence results, we also upper bound the error between the true signal frequencies and amplitudes with those found by Gradient-MUSIC. For example, if the noise has $\ell^\infty$ norm at most $\varepsilon$, then the frequencies and amplitudes are recovered up to error at most $C\varepsilon/m$ and $C\varepsilon$ respectively, which are minimax optimal in $m$ and $\varepsilon$. Our theory can also handle stochastic noise with performance guarantees under nonstationary independent Gaussian noise. Our main approach is a comprehensive geometric analysis of the landscape, a perspective that has not been explored before.</description>

      <title>Transaction Capacity, Security and Latency in Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze how secure a block is after the block becomes $k$-deep, i.e., security-latency, for Nakamoto consensus under an exponential network delay model. We provide the fault tolerance and extensive bounds on safety violation probabilities given mining rate, delay rate and confirmation rules. Next, modeling the blockchain system as a batch service queue with exponential network delay, we connect the security-latency analysis to sustainable transaction rate of the queue system. As our model assumes exponential network delay, batch service queue models give a meaningful trade-off between transaction capacity, security and latency. Our results indicate that, by simply picking $k=7$-block confirmation rule in Bitcoin instead of the convention of $k=6$, mining rate, latency and throughput can be increased sixfold with the same safety guarantees. We further consider adversarial attacks on the queue service to hamper the service process. In an extreme scenario, we consider the selfish-mining attack for this purpose and provide the maximum adversarial block ratio in the longest chain under the exponential delay model. The ratio in turn reflects the maximum rate of decrease in the sustainable transaction rate of the queue.</description>

      <title>FedMeld: A Model-dispersal Federated Learning Framework for Space-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the digital divide, the space-ground integrated networks (SGINs), which will be a key component of the six-generation (6G) mobile networks, are expected to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services to every corner of the world. One mission of SGINs is to support federated learning (FL) at a global scale. However, existing space-ground integrated FL frameworks involve ground stations or costly inter-satellite links, entailing excessive training latency and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an infrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal (FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and store-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing across large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld leads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval and mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design the staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training loss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without compromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed form and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the optimal latency-accuracy tradeoff. Experiments using various datasets demonstrate that FedMeld achieves superior model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs as compared with traditional FL schemes for SGINs.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Secure Beamfocusing With Receiver-Centered Protected Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies near-field secure communications through transmit beamfocusing. We examine the benefit of having a protected eavesdropper-free zone around the legitimate receiver, and we determine the worst-case secrecy performance against a potential eavesdropper located anywhere outside the protected zone. A max-min optimization problem is formulated for the beamfocusing design with and without artificial noise transmission. Despite the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a synchronous gradient descent-ascent framework that approximates the global maximin solution. A low-complexity solution is also derived that delivers excellent performance over a wide range of operating conditions. We further extend this study to a scenario where it is not possible to physically enforce a protected zone. To this end, we consider secure communications through the creation of a virtual protected zone using a full-duplex legitimate receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting either the physical or virtual receiver-centered protected zone with appropriately designed beamfocusing is an effective strategy for achieving secure near-field communications.</description>

      <title>Model-based Implicit Neural Representation for sub-wavelength Radio Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in complex static NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.</description>
