      <title>Alignment frustration-induced swarming lattice in the Vicsek-Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto model of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha &lt; \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>From chaotic itinerancy to intermittent synchronization in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although synchronization has been extensively studied, important processes underlying its emergence have remained hidden by the use of global order parameters. Here, we uncover how the route unfolds through a sequential transition between two well-known but previously unconnected phenomena: chaotic itinerancy (CI) and intermittent synchronization (IS). Using a new symbolic dynamics, we show that CI emerges as a collective yet unsynchronized exploration of different domains of the high-dimensional attractor, whose dimension is reduced as the coupling increases, ultimately collapsing back into the reference chaotic attractor of an individual unit. At this stage, the IS can emerge as irregular alternations between synchronous and asynchronous phases. The two phenomena are therefore mutually exclusive, each dominating a distinct coupling interval and governed by different mechanisms. Network structural heterogeneity enhances itinerant behavior since access to different domains of the attractor depends on the nodes' topological roles. The CI--IS crossover occurs within a consistent coupling interval across models and topologies. Experiments on electronic oscillator networks confirm this two-step process, establishing a unified framework for the route to synchronization in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Control of Hypergraphs: Leveraging THIS to Damp Noise in Diffusive Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllability determines whether a system's state can be guided toward any desired configuration, making it a fundamental prerequisite for designing effective control strategies. In the context of networked systems, controllability is a well-established concept. However, many real-world systems, from biological collectives to engineered infrastructures, exhibit higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by simple graphs. Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system. Here, we close the loop between a hypergraph representation and our recently developed hypergraph inference algorithm, THIS, to infer the underlying multibody couplings. Building on the inferred structure, we design a parsimonious controller that, given a minimal set of controllable nodes, steers the system toward a desired configuration. We validate the proposed system identification and control framework on a network of Kuramoto oscillators evolving over a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Non-verbal Perception of Room Acoustics using Multi Dimensional Scaling Metho</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subjective room acoustics impressions play an important role for the performance and reception of music in concert venues and auralizations. Therefore, room acoustics since the 20th century dealt with the relationship between objective, acoustic parameters and subjective impressions of room acoustics. One common approach is to correlate acoustic measures with experts' subjective ratings of rooms as recalled from their long-term memory, and explain them using acoustical measures. Another approach is to let listeners rate auralized room acoustics on bipolar scales and find objective correlates. In this study, we present an alternative approach to characterizing the subjective impressions of room acoustics. We concolve music with binaural room impulse response measurements and utilize Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to identify the perceptual dimensions of room acoustics. Results show that the perception of room acoustics has $5$ dimensions that can be explained by the (psycho-)acoustical measures echo density, fractal correlation dimension, roughness, loudness, and early decay time.</description>

      <title>Sound impact of simple viscoelastic damping changes due to aging and the role of the double bentside on soundboard tension in a 1755 Dulcken harpsichord</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound perception of wood aging is investigated on a Dulcken harpsichord of 1755 from the Museum of Applied Arts in Hamburg, Germany using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) model of the harpsichords soundboard. The soundboard thickness was measured on the instrument at 497 positions during strings being deattached and used in the model. Impulse responses were taken on the instrument to estimate the present internal damping by calculating the T60 decay time and used as a model input. By varying the internal damping from this measured damping as a logarithmic decrement, impulse responses were simulated at 52 string positions on both, the 8' and 4' bridge. To estimate the changed sound brightness due to changed internal damping, spectral centroids were calculated from the simulated impulse responses. A dependency of brightness change due to aging on string position was found, where the lower strings have higher brightness, as expected, while the higher strings have decreased brightness. This counterintuitive finding is caused by the frequency-dependent filter effect of changed damping. Future studies need to incorporate viscoelasticity to differentiate this effect further. Furthermore, the attachment of the 8' string to the outer instead of the inner wall, a characteristic feature of Dulcken harpsichords, is investigated using a 3D Finite-Element Method (FEM) model simulation of the whole instrument. No considerable changes on the soundboard tension were found compared to an attachment of the 8' strings to the inner wall, pointing to another reason for this special construction.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>

      <title>Controller for rejection of the first harmonic in a periodic signal with uncertain delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plant (the system to be controlled) is disturbed by a periodic external force with a broad spectrum of Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) is assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by a control force, whereas the other harmonics should be preserved without distortion. Because the measured plant data have an unknown amount of time delay (dead time) and the sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, therefore the amplitude and phase of a sine-type control force are also unknown. Based on the internal model principle, we developed a feedback controller described as a linear time-invariant system that can remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting its control force parameters. Using this controller, we aimed to further extend the capabilities of a newly developed high-speed, large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy. In such a scanning technique, the sample is rotated, and the tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces a parasitic first Fourier harmonic, which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>
