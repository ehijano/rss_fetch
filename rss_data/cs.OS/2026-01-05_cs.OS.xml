      <title>Evolution of Android's Permission-based Security Model and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Android Permission Model and Application (app) analysis has consistently remained the focus of the investigation of research groups and stakeholders of the Android ecosystem since it was launched in 2008. Even though the Android smartphone operating system (OS) permission model has evolved significantly from `all-or-none access' to `user-chosen dangerous resource access', specific challenges and issues remain unresolved even after 15 years after the smartphone OS launch. This study addresses the issues and documents the research work in this arena through a comprehensive literature survey and comparative analysis.
  The survey's focal point is the Android permission model and relevant research between 2010-2022. We systematize the knowledge on (i) Android API Calls to permissions mapping, (ii) Android Permissions evolution, and (iii) how permissions are checked. Furthermore, the survey identifies the permission-related issues and relevant research addressed during the last decade. We reference seminal work in these areas. We summarize the identified research gaps and present future directions for early and experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Towards Fully-fledged GPU Multitasking via Proactive Memory Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limited HBM capacity has become the primary bottleneck for hosting an increasing number of larger-scale GPU tasks. While demand paging extends capacity via host DRAM, it incurs up to 78x slowdown due to the massive working sets and poor locality of GPU workloads. We observe, however, that GPU memory access patterns are inherently predictable via kernel launch arguments and their asynchronous execution nature. Leveraging this, we propose MSched, an OS-level scheduler that extends GPU context switching to include proactive working set preparation, thereby coalescing fragmented, eventual, and expensive page faults into a single efficient migration. MSched employs a template-based approach to predict working sets with near-perfect accuracy and proposes a co-design between task scheduler and memory manager to enforce a globally optimal page placement policy. Evaluation demonstrates that MSched outperforms demand paging by up to 11.05x for scientific and deep learning workloads, and 57.88x for LLM under memory oversubscription.</description>
