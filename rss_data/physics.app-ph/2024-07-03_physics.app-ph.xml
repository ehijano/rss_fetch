      <title>Broadband planar electromagnetic hyper-lens with uniform magnification in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar hyper-lens, capable of creating sub-wavelength imaging for broadband electromagnetic wave, is designed based on electromagnetic null medium. Subsequently, a scheme for the implementation of the proposed hyper-lens is given by using well-designed flexural metal plates, which function as the reduced electromagnetic null medium for TM-polarized microwaves. Both simulated and measured results verify that the hyper-lens designed with flexural metal plates can achieve super-resolution imaging for microwave at operating wavelength ({\lambda}0=3cm) with a resolution of 0.25{\lambda}0 and a uniform magnification of about 5. Moreover, the designed hyper-lens ensures that both the object and image surfaces are planes, and simultaneously provides a uniform magnification for objects in different positions. Additionally, the proposed hyper-lens offers a broadband super-resolution imaging capabilities, achieving good super-resolution imaging effects for microwave frequencies ranging from 8.5 to 11 GHz. The proposed hyper-lens may find applications in high precision imaging, detection, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Growth of Rutile GeO$_2$ via MOCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile Germanium Dioxide (r-GeO$_2$) has been identified as an ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor recently, featuring a bandgap of 4.68 eV, comparable to Ga$_2$O$_3$ but offering bipolar dopability, higher electron mobility, higher thermal conductivity, and higher Baliga's figure of merit (BFOM).These superior properties position GeO$_2$ as a promising material for various semiconductor applications. However, the epitaxial growth of r-GeO$_2$, particularly in its most advantageous rutile polymorph, is still at an early stage. This work explores the growth of r-GeO$_2$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on an r-TiO$_2$ (001) substrate, utilizing tetraethyl germane (TEGe) as the precursor. Our investigations reveal that higher growth temperatures significantly enhance crystalline quality, achieving a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.181 degree at 925 degree C, compared to 0.54 degree at 840 degree C and amorphous structures at 725 degree C. Additionally, we found that longer growth durations increase surface roughness due to the formation of faceted crystals. Meanwhile, adjusting the susceptor rotation speed from 300 RPM to 170 RPM plays a crucial role in optimizing crystalline quality, effectively reducing surface roughness by approximately 15 times. This study offers a foundational guide for optimizing MOCVD growth conditions of r-GeO$_2$ films, emphasizing the crucial need for precise control over deposition temperature and rotation speed to enhance adatom mobility and effectively minimize the boundary layer thickness.</description>

      <title>18 GHz Solidly Mounted Resonator in Scandium Aluminum Nitride on SiO2/Ta2O5 Bragg Reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports an acoustic solidly mounted resonator (SMR) at 18.64 GHz, among the highest operating frequencies reported. The device is built in scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) on top of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) Bragg reflectors on silicon (Si) wafer. The stack is analyzed with X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The resonator shows a coupling coefficient (k2) of 2.0%, high series quality factor (Qs) of 156, shunt quality factor (Qp) of 142, and maximum Bode quality factor (Qmax) of 210. The third-order harmonics at 59.64 GHz is also observed with k2 around 0.6% and Q around 40. Upon further development, the reported acoustic resonator platform can enable various front-end signal-processing functions, e.g., filters and oscillators, at future frequency range 3 (FR3) bands.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological transitions and spectral singularities in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Floquet driving and non-Hermitian gain/loss could give rise to intriguing phenomena including topological funneling of light, edge-state delocalization, anomalous topological transitions and Floquet non-Hermitian skin effects. In this work, we uncover two unique phenomena in Floquet systems caused by gain and loss. First, multiple topological transitions from anomalous Floquet second-order topological insulators to anomalous Floquet first-order topological insulators and then to normal insulators can be induced by gain and loss. Interestingly, the resulting anomalous Floquet insulators further carry hybrid skin-topological boundary modes, which could either be fully localized or localized to different edges at different time slices and traversing along all edges in a single driving period. The topological phase transitions are also shown to be detectable through studies of transmission properties in the setting of coupled ring resonators. Second, gain and loss are found to induce singularities in the Floquet spectral, around which anomalous transmissions at flat quasienergy bands are predicted. These discoveries not only enhanced our understanding of topological matter and phase transitions in driven non-Hermitian systems, but also promoted their experimental realizations in optical and acoustic settings.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Fano Nanoantennas for Enabling Sub-Nanosecond Lifetimes in NV-based Single Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are essential sources of single photons, and enhancing their emission rates is of paramount importance for applications in quantum communications, computing, and metrology. One approach is to couple quantum emitters with resonant photonic nanostructures, where the emission rate is enhanced due to the Purcell effect. Dielectric nanoantennas are promising as they provide strong emission enhancement compared to plasmonic ones, which suffer from high Ohmic loss. Here, we designed and fabricated a dielectric Fano resonator based on a pair of silicon (Si) ellipses and a disk, which supports the mode hybridization between quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (quasi-BIC) and Mie resonance. We demonstrated the performance of the developed resonant system by interfacing it with single photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs). We observed that the interfaced emitters have a Purcell enhancement factor of ~10, with sub-ns emission lifetime and a polarization contrast of 9. Our results indicate a promising method for developing efficient and compact single-photon sources for integrated quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Visible, Near-, and Mid-infrared Computational Spectrometer Enabled by Single-Spinning Film Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational spectrometers are pivotal in enabling low-cost, in-situ and rapid spectral analysis, with potential applications in chemistry, biology, and environmental science. However, filter-based spectral encoding approaches typically use filter arrays, complicating the manufacturing process and hindering device consistency. By capitalizing on the polarization separation effect under oblique incidence (PSEOI), we pioneer the use of a single filter for highly efficient spectral encoding, and propose a novel computational spectrometer spanning visible to mid-infrared wavelengths by combining the Single-Spinning Film Encoder (SSFE) with deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is employed to optimize the film configuration of SSFE, achieving low-correlation and high-complexity spectral responses under different polarizations and spinning angles, thereby enhancing both spectral resolution and accuracy of reconstruction across diverse spectral ranges. Spectral resolutions up to 0.5 nm, 2 nm, 10 nm can be realized for single-peak narrowband spectra, and 3 nm, 6 nm, 20 nm for dual-peak narrowband spectra, over the visible, near-, and mid-infrared wavelength ranges, respectively. Moreover, the proposed spectrometer demonstrates an overall 81.38% precision for the classification of 220 chemical compounds, confirming its robustness and precision in practical scenarios, along with the capability for compact, cost-effective spectroscopic solutions.</description>

      <title>Optically Pumped Terahertz Amplitude Modulation in Type-II Ge QD/Si heterostructures grown via Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article exploits group-IV germanium (Ge) quantum dots (QDs) on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to explore its optical behaviour in the Terahertz (THz) regime. In this work, Ge QDs, pumped by an above bandgap near infrared wavelength, exhibit THz amplitude modulation in the frequency range of 0.1-1.0 THz. The epitaxial Ge QDs outperform reference SOI substrate in THz amplitude modulation owing to higher carrier generation in weakly confined dots compared to its bulk counterpart. This is further corroborated using theoretical model based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. This model enables the calculation of photo carriers generated (PCG) and their confinement in the Ge QD region. Our model also reroutes the calculation from PCG to corresponding plasma frequency and hence to refractive index and THz photo-conductivity. Moreover, the photo-generated confined holes accumulation at the Ge QDs-Si interface is elevated after optical illumination, leading to a decreased THz photo-conductivity. This augmentation in THz photo-conductivity contributes to a significant enhancement of THz modulation depth ~77% at Ge QDs-Si interfaces compared to bare SOI at 0.1 THz.</description>

      <title>Wideband Coherent Microwave Conversion via Magnon Nonlinearity in Hybrid Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency conversion is a widely realized physical process in nonlinear systems of optics and electronics. As an emerging nonlinear platform, spintronic devices have the potential to achieve stronger frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrated a microwave frequency conversion method in a hybrid quantum system, integrating nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with magnetic thin film CoFeB. We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz, presenting an up to $\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further display the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits coherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques based on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic response in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry breaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can be adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits, expanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising on-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Programming universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose silicon photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose programmable photonic processors provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse functionalities on a single chip. Leveraging a two-dimensional hexagonal waveguide mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, these systems have demonstrated significant potential in microwave photonics applications. Additionally, they are a promising platform for creating unitary linear transformations, which are key elements in quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, a general procedure for implementing these transformations on such systems has not been established yet. This work demonstrates the programming of universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose programmable photonic circuit with a hexagonal topology. We detail the steps to split the light on-chip, demonstrate that an equivalent structure to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one internal and one external phase shifter can be built in the hexagonal mesh, and program both the triangular and rectangular architectures for matrix multiplication. We recalibrate the system to account for passive phase deviations. Experimental programming of 3x3 and 4x4 random unitary matrices yields fidelities &gt; 98% and bit precisions over 5 bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that random unitary matrices are demonstrated on a general-purpose photonic processor and pave the way for the implementation of programmable photonic circuits in optical computing and signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Improvement of the perovskite photodiodes performance via advanced interface engineering with polymer dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskite-based photodiodes are promising for efficient detection across a broad spectral range. Perovskite absorber thin-films have a microcrystalline morphology, characterized by a high density of surface states and defects at inter-grain interfaces. In this work, we used dielectric-ferroelectric poly(vinylidene-fluoride-trifluoroethylene-P(VDF-TrFE) to modify the bulk interfaces and electron transport junction in p-i-n perovskite photodiodes. Our complex work demonstrates that interface engineering with P(VDF-TrFE) induces significant Fermi level pinning, reducing from 4.85 eV for intrinsic perovskite to 4.28 eV for the configuration with dielectric interlayers. The integration of P(VDF-TrFE) into the perovskite film did not affect the morphology and crystal structure, but significantly changed the charge transport and device performance. IV curve analysis and 2-diode model calculations showed enhanced shunt properties, a decreased non-ideality factor, and reduced saturation dark current. We have shown that the complex introduction of P(VDF-TrFE) into the absorbers bulk and on its surface is essential to reduce the impact of the trapping processes. For P(VDF-TrFE) containing devices, we increased the specific detectivity from 10^11 to 10^12 Jones, expanded the linear dynamic range up to 100 dB, and reduced the equivalent noise power to 10^-13 W*Hz^-0.5. Reducing non-radiative recombination contributions significantly enhanced device performance, improving rise/fall times from 6.3/10.9 us to 4.6/6.5 us. The cut-off frequency (3dB) increased from 64.8 kHz to 74.8 kHz following the introduction of the dielectric. These results provide new insights into the use of organic dielectrics and an improved understanding of trap-states and ion defect compensation for detectors based on perovskite heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Do Quantum Neural Networks have Simplicity Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they are highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and they have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as simplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because most real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.</description>

Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>

Abstract: In the field of magnonics, which uses magnons, the quanta of spin waves, for energy-efficient data processing, significant progress has been made leveraging the capabilities of the inverse design concept. This approach involves defining a desired functionality and employing a feedback-loop algorithm to optimise the device design. In this study, we present the first experimental demonstration of a reconfigurable, lithography-free, and simulation-free inverse-design device capable of implementing various RF components. The device features a square array of independent direct current loops that generate a complex reconfigurable magnetic medium atop a Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) rectangular film for data processing in the gigahertz range. Showcasing its versatility, the device addresses inverse problems using two algorithms to create RF notch filters and demultiplexers. Additionally, the device holds promise for binary, reservoir, and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Cavitated Ag Paste for Cost-Effective Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08763</link>

Abstract: This paper reports on the investigation of cavitated silver paste produced by cavitation technology as a cost-effective alternative to traditional three-roll milling (TRM). Cavitation, utilizing high-frequency sound waves, enhances metal paste dispersion, reduces oxidation, extends shelf life, and minimizes waste. Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar cells made with cavitated silver paste achieved a 21% energy conversion efficiency, slightly lower than the 22% efficiency of conventional paste. Cavitated paste produced finer gridlines, reducing silver usage and costs but increasing contact resistance, leading to a lower fill factor. Despite this, cavitation technology shows promise for more efficient and cost-effective solar cell production. Further research is needed to optimize efficiency and resistance, highlighting the potential for cavitation technology in commercial applications.</description>

      <title>TriMe++: Multi-threaded triangular meshing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating a large mesh with $10^6$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>

      <title>Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>
