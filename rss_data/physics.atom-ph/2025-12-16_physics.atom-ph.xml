      <title>Barium Autoionization for Efficient Ion Trap Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical and experimental investigation of autoionizing resonances from the $5d6p\,{}^3\mathrm{D}_1^o$ manifold in neutral barium for efficient loading of ion traps. Our calculations predict large resonant cross sections for many narrow autoionizing resonances, but we find experimentally that for most of these, Doppler broadening during trap loading depresses the effective cross sections that can be achieved in practice. We identify and demonstrate a strong, broad transition at $531\,\mathrm{nm}$, and show that it furnishes an order-of-magnitude increase in trap loading efficiency compared to other demonstrated resonances.</description>

      <title>Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions in a laser-cooled Ca+ matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the sympathetic cooling and Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions (HCIs) with laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions. The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>A Coulomb-included model for high-order harmonic generation from atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strong laser-atom interactions, the Coulomb potential can affect the trajectories of rescattering electron in high-order harmonic generation (HHG). Here, by constructing a semi-analytical Coulomb-included model and comparing it with numerical experiments that allow for direct observation of electron trajectories, we identify the role of Coulomb potential in different processes of HHG. We show that the symmetry of the system determined by Coulomb potential plays an important role in the ionization process of HHG, inducing the tunneling-out time of electrons to shift towards earlier times. This symmetry-related effect reflects the quantum properties of atomic systems, in sharp contrast to the classical Coulomb-induced acceleration in the recombination process. In particular, compared with other strong-filed models, the scaling law of the amplitude of HHG electron trajectories predicted by this model agrees with the numerical experiments, indicating that the model developed here can be used to quantitatively describe HHG. This model can also be used to study strong-field ionization significantly influenced by rescattering.</description>

      <title>Parity Nonconservation in Rb and Sr$^+$ due to Low-Mass Vector Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the parity non-conserving (PNC) electric-dipole ($E1$) transition amplitudes for the $4s - 5s$ and $4s - 4d_{3/2}$ transitions in Rb and Sr$^+$. Our results include both the nuclear-spin-independent and nuclear-spin-dependent contributions, with particular emphasis on the potential effects of a hypothetical additional $Z'$-boson. We highlight possible advantages of using light atoms in searches for such new interaction. The ratio of the contribution of a low mass $Z'$-boson to the contribution of the Standard model $Z$-boson to PNC effects increases rapidly (faster than $1/Z^2$) with decreasing nuclear charge $Z$. Another advantage is that theoretical interpretations of experiments in lighter systems may be carried out with a higher accuracy than that in Cs, Ba$^+$, Fr and Ra$^+$.</description>

      <title>Cavity Mediated Two-Qubit Gate: Tuning to Optimal Performance with NISQ Era Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of photon-mediated operations are critical to the realization of scalable quantum information processing platforms and their accurate characterization is essential for the identification of optimal regimes and their experimental realizations. Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Interaction-assisted topological pumping in few- and many-atom Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observation of a supersolid stripe state in two-dimensional dipolar gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations typically destroy long-range order in two-dimensional (2D) systems, posing a fundamental challenge to the existence of exotic states like supersolids, which paradoxically combine solid-like structure with frictionless superfluid flow. While long-predicted, the definitive observation of a 2D supersolid has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here, we report the observation of a supersolid stripe phase in a strongly dipolar quantum gas of erbium atoms confined to 2D. We directly image the periodic density modulation, confirming its global phase coherence through matter-wave interference and demonstrating its phase rigidity relevant to the low-energy Goldstone mode, consistent with numerical calculations. Through collective excitation measurements, we demonstrate the hydrodynamic behavior of the supersolid. This work highlights a novel mechanism for supersolid formation in low dimensions, and opens the door for future research on the intricate interplay between temperature, supersolidity, and dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Electronic Structure Theory: From Diatomic Lambda-Doubling to Macroscopic Einstein-de Haas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $\Lambda$-doubling energy splitting (or $\Lambda$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $\Lambda-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Overtone Spectroscopy of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotationally resolved spectra of the HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ molecular ions have been recorded in the spectral range between 6200 and 6800 \rcm\ using a cryogenic ion trap instrument. The rovibrational transitions were probed using two different action spectroscopy schemes, namely laser-induced reaction (LIR) and leak-out spectroscopy (LOS). Various vibrational bands of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ were measured with high resolution for the first time. For HNC$^+$, the $\text{X}~^2\Sigma^+~(20^00)-(00^00)$ overtone band was recorded using LIR, while LOS was used to probe the $\text{X}~^2\Pi~(000)^1-(210)^0\mu$ combination band and the $\text{X}~^2\Pi~(000)^1-\text{A}~^2\Sigma^+~(10^00)$ vibronic band of HCN$^+$. Spectroscopic constants, band origins and radiative lifetimes for the observed states have been determined. The effective fit for the HCN$^+$ spectra revealed the presence of strong vibrational couplings leading to perturbations of the rovibrational levels of the excited states. The two action spectroscopy schemes are compared and their potential use to explore ion-molecule interactions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Arrival Time -- Classical Parameter or Quantum Operator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of how to interpret and compute arrival-time distributions in quantum mechanics remains unsettled, reflecting the longstanding tension between treating time as a quantum observable or as a classical parameter. Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Optically trapped Feshbach molecules of fermionic $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K: Role of light-induced and collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a dense, ultracold sample of weakly bound DyK dimers stored in an optical dipole trap. Our bosonic dimers are composed of the fermionic isotopes $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K, which is of particular interest for experiments related to pairing and superfluidity in fermionic systems with mass imbalance. We have realized dipole traps with near-infrared laser light in four different wavelength regions between 1050 and 2002 nm. We have identified trap-light-induced processes as the overall dominant source of losses, except for wavelengths around 2000 nm, where light-induced losses appeared to be much weaker. In a trap near 1550 nm, we found a plateau of minimal light-induced losses, and by carefully tuning the wavelength, we reached conditions where losses from inelastic collisions between the trapped dimers became observable. For very weakly bound dimers close to the center of a magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the Pauli suppression of collisional losses by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of Zeeman and hyperfine optical pumping and transverse laser cooling of a dysprosium (Dy) atomic beam on the $4f^{10}6s^2(J = 8) \rightarrow 4f^{10}6s6p(J = 9)$ transition at 421.291 nm. For $^{163}$Dy, an electro-optic modulator is used to generate five frequency sidebands required to pump the atoms to the $F = 10.5$ ground state hyperfine level and the light polarization is chosen to pump the atoms to the $m_F = 10.5$ Zeeman sublevel. The atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled using a standing wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. The resulting polarized and cooled atomic beam will be used in fundamental physics experiments taking advantage of the accidental degeneracy of excited states in Dy including the ongoing measurement of parity violation in this system.</description>

      <title>Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. We propose and analyze a flat-bottomed hollow-beam ponderomotive optical trap for an ultracold neutral plasma (UNP), driven by a high-power CO$_2$ laser. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the plasma and Rydberg atoms are effectively trapped within a nearly uniform dark region bounded by repulsive light walls. In contrast to RF traps, flat-bottomed traps yield a small density-weighted mean ponderomotive energy per electron, while the UNP collision frequency is far below the laser frequency, thereby making collisional absorption negligible and does not limit the lifetime of the trap. This approach could enhance antimatter production and storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Topological Berry Phase with a Single Phonon in an Ion Microtrap Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\mu$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.</description>
