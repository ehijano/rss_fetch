      <title>Derivation over twisted group ring and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies the derivations of twisted group algebras in terms of the generators and defining relations of the group. In particular, we generalize some know results over group algebras to the case of twisted group algebras. We will give necessary and sufficient condition for a map defined over the generators to be extended to a derivation over a twisted group ring. We present how this results can be use in case of an abelian group or dihedral group. We also present how this results can be use to compute the first Hochschild cohomology group of twisted group algebras.</description>

      <title>$\omega$-Lie bialgebras and $\omega$-Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the definition of multiplicative $\omega$-Lie bialgebra, which is equivalent to the Manin triples and matched pairs. We also study the $\omega$-Yang-Baxter equation and Yang-Baxter $\omega$-Lie bialgebra. The skew-symmetric solutions of the $\omega$-Yang-Baxter equation can be used to construct Yang-Baxter $\omega$-Lie bialgebra. We further introduce the concept of the $\omega$-$\mathcal{O}$-operator, which can be constructed from a left-symmetric algebras, and based on the $\omega$-$\mathcal{O}$-operator, we construct skew-symmetric solutions to the $\omega$-Yang--Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Local Rigidity of Quasi--Lie Brackets on Quaternionic Banach Modules and Applications to Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a local rigidity theorem for quasi--Lie brackets on quaternionic Banach right modules. Under quantitative control of antisymmetry and Jacobi defects, we construct an explicit bilinear correction that preserves right $\mathbb{H}$--linearity and restores the exact Lie property. The approach combines a radial homotopy operator, a controlled Neumann-series inversion, and a finite-rank adjustment, all with explicit operator estimates. This constructive framework bridges quaternionic functional analysis with rigidity theory and yields concrete applications to nonlinear PDEs, including local well-posedness and Beale--Kato--Majda continuation criteria with explicit thresholds.</description>

      <title>The Levi-Civita products of Leibniz algebras with nondegenerate skew-symmetric 2-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the associated Levi-Civita products of a Leibniz algebra with a nondegenerate skew-symmetric $2$-cocycle. Such products form into the notion of an anti-pre-Leibniz algebra, which is characterized as a Leibniz-admissible algebra which renders a representation of the sub-adjacent Leibniz algebra through the negative multiplication operators. Such a characterization serves as the converse side of the role that pre-Liebniz algebras play in the splitting theory of Leibniz algebras, which justifies the name of anti-pre-Leibniz algebras. There is a compatible anti-pre-Leibniz algebra structure on a Leibniz algebra if and only if there is an invertible anti-$\mathcal{O}$-operator of the Leibniz algebra. Another important role that anti-pre-Leibniz algebras play is that they give a new characterization of Novikov dialgebras, that is, a Novikov dialgebra is interpreted as a transformed pre-Leibniz algebra which gives rise to an anti-pre-Leibniz algebra structure through specific combinations of multiplications. The properties of Novikov dialgebras are also further investigated.</description>

      <title>Completely Positive Biquadratic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systemically introduce completely positive biquadratic (CPB) tensors and copositive biquadratic tensors. We show that all weakly CPB tensors are sum of squares tensors, the CPB tensor cone and the copositive biquadratic tensor cone are dual cone to each other. We also show that the outer product of two completely positive matrices is a CPB tensor, and the outer product of two copositive matrices is a copositive biquadratic tensor. We then study two easily checkable subclasses of CPB tensors, namely positive biquadratic Cauchy tensors and biquadratic Pascal tensors. We show that a biquadratic Pascal tensor is both strongly CPB and positive definite.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal relations for orthogonal quantum matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the family of the orthogonal quantum matrix algebras we investigate the structure of their characteristic subalgebras -- special commutative subalgebras, which for the subfamily of the reflection equation algebras appear to be central. In [OP1] we described three generating sets of the characteristic subalgebras of the symplectic and orthogonal quantum matrix algebras. One of these -- the set of the elementary sums -- is finite. In the symplectic case the elementary sums are in general algebraically independent. On the contrary, in the orthogonal case the elementary sums turn out to be dependent. We obtain a set of quadratic reciprocal relations for these generators. Next, we resolve the reciprocal relations for the quantum orthogonal matrix algebra extended by the inverse of the quantum matrix. As an auxiliary result, we derive the commutation relations between the q-determinant of the quantum orthogonal matrix and the generators of the quantum matrix algebra, that is, the components of the quantum matrix.</description>

      <title>Homological epimorphisms in functor categories and singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a homological epimorphism $\pi:\mathcal{C}\longrightarrow \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{I}$ between $K$-categories, we show that if the ideal $\mathcal{I}$ satisfies certain conditions, then there exists an equivalence between the singularity categories $\mathbf{D}_{sg}(\mathrm{Mod}(\mathcal{C}))$ and $ \mathbf{D}_{sg}(\mathrm{Mod}(\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{I}))$. This result generalizes the one obtained by Xiao-Wu Chen in [6]. We apply our result to the one point extension category and show that there is a singular equivalence between a $K$-category $\mathcal{U}$ and its one point extension category $\Lambda:=\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} \mathcal{C}_{K} &amp; 0 \\ \underline{M} &amp; \mathcal{U} \end{smallmatrix}\right].$</description>

      <title>A Symmetric-Key Cryptosystem Based on the Burnside Ring of a Compact Lie Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed, finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$; and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$ and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators $\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is \emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext distinguisher based on dihedral probes.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Bases Native to Term-ordered Commutative Algebras, with Application to the Hodge Algebra of Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by better understanding the bideterminant (=product of minors) basis on the polynomial ring in $n \times m$ variables, we develop theory \&amp; algorithms for Gr\"obner bases in not only algebras with straightening law (ASLs or Hodge algebras), but in any commutative algebra over a field that comes equipped with a notion of "monomial" (generalizing the standard monomials of ASLs) and a suitable term order. Rather than treating such an algebra $A$ as a quotient of a polynomial ring and then "lifting" ideals from $A$ to ideals in the polynomial ring, the theory we develop is entirely "native" to $A$ and its given notion of monomial.
  When applied to the case of bideterminants, this enables us to package several standard results on bideterminants in a clean way that enables new results. In particular, once the theory is set up, it lets us give an almost-trivial proof of a universal Gr\"obner basis (in our sense) for the ideal of $t$-minors for any $t$. We note that here it was crucial that theory be native to $A$ and its given monomial structure, as in the standard monomial structure given by bideterminants each $t$-minor is a single variable rather than a sum of $t!$ many terms (in the "ordinary monomial" structure).</description>

      <title>Symplectic groups over Lie subgroups of involutive algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ associated to a Lie subgroup $G$ of a (possibly noncommutative) associative algebra $A$ equipped with an anti-involution $\sigma$. Our construction recovers several classical Lie groups as special cases, and in particular provides new realizations of spin groups as instances of $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ for suitable subgroups $G$ of the Clifford algebra. This case is not covered by the framework, which focuses on the specific situation $G = A^\times$, and is thus of particular interest.
  We construct and study geometric spaces on which $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ acts. In particular, we define the space of $G$-isotropic elements and the corresponding space of $G$-isotropic lines, which generalize the classical projective line. We analyze the group action on these spaces and introduce natural invariants, such as the notion of positive triples and quadruples of $G$-isotropic lines and a generalized cross-ratio of positive quadruples of $G$-isotropic lines. Finally, when the Lie algebra of $G$ is Hermitian, we define the associated Riemannian symmetric space of $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G,\sigma)$ and provide several models for it.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider associative algebras equipped with derivations. A pair consisting of an associative algebra and a distinguished derivation is called an AssDer pair. We study central extensions and formal one-parameter deformations of AssDer pairs in terms of cohomology. Finally, we define $2$-derivations on associative $2$-algebras and show that the category of associative $2$-algebras with $2$-derivations is equivalent to the category of $2$-term $A_\infty$-algebras with homotopy derivations.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of commutative Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hopf algebras, most generally in a semisimple abelian symmetric monoidal category, are here supposed to be commutative but not to be of finite-type, and their (equivariant) smoothness are discussed. Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_H^2(H^+) \to H^+$ defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category $\mathsf{Vec}$ of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)--(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category $\mathsf{sVec}$ of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i). In the case where $\operatorname{char}k=p&gt;0$, there are shown weaker properties of ordinary Hopf algebras and of Hopf algebras in $\mathsf{sVec}$ or in the ind-completion $\mathsf{Ver}_p^{\mathrm{ind}}$ of the Verlinde category.</description>

Abstract: The algebraic and geometric classifications of complex $3$-dimensional right alternative and semi-alternative algebras are given. As corollaries, we have the algebraic and geometric classification of complex $3$-dimensional $\mathfrak{perm}$, binary $\mathfrak{perm}$, associative, $(-1,1)$-, binary $(-1,1)$-, and assosymmetric algebras. In particular, we proved that the first example of non-associative right alternative algebras appears in dimension $3;$ the first example of non-associative assosymmetric algebras appears in dimension $3;$ the first example of non-assosymmetric semi-alternative algebras appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of binary $(-1,1)$-algebras, which is non-$(-1,1)$-, appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of right alternative algebras, which is not binary $(-1,1)$-, appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of binary $\mathfrak{perm}$ non-$\mathfrak{perm}$ algebras appears in dimension $4.$ As a byproduct, we give a more easy answer to problem 2.109 from the Dniester Notebook, previously resolved by Shestakov and Arenas.</description>

      <title>Structure of the Cayley-Dickson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing the Cayley-Dickson process as a graded construction provides a rigorous definition of associativity consisting of three types and the non-associative parts dividing into four types. These simplify the Moufang loop identities and Mal'cev's identity, which identifies the non-associative Lie algebra structure. This structure is distinct for the first four power-associative algebras and has the same pattern for at least the next three. The structure is identified with 3-cycles and modes that reduce sets of 84 zero divisors to just 7, in most cases, such as for the sedenions, and identifies the subalgebas of the power associative algebras that provide zero divisors thus defining the structure of Cayley-Dickson algebras. The zero divisor and octonion cardinality at all levels is derived. Split algebras are proved to be isomorphic for any power-associative algebra and share the same non-associative structure with different zero divisors. Due to the inclusion of new power-associative algebras into the hypercomplex algebras the terminology ultracomplex numbers is suggested.</description>

      <title>The isotropy group of a derivation on a Danielewski-type algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, we consider in this paper $k$-algebras of the form $$A_{c,q}=k[x,y,z]/\big(c(x)z-q(x,y)\big),$$ where $c(x)\in k[x]$ is a polynomial of degree at least two and $q(x,y)\in k[x,y]$ is a quasi-monic polynomial of degree at least two with respect to $y$. We give a complete description of the $k$-automorphism group of $A_{c,q}$ as an abstract group. Moreover, for every non-locally nilpotent $k$-derivation $\delta$ of $A_{c,q}$ we prove that the isotropy group of $\delta$ is a linear algebraic group of dimension at most three.</description>

      <title>Pre-Calabi--Yau algebras and homotopy double Poisson gebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the notion of a curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebra is equivalent to the notion of a curved homotopy double Poisson gebra, thereby settling the equivalence between the two ways to define derived noncommutative Poisson structures. We actually prove that the respective differential graded Lie algebras controlling both deformation theories are isomorphic.This allows us to apply the recent developments of the properadic calculus in order to establish the homotopical properties of curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebras: infinity-morphisms, homotopy transfer theorem, formality, Koszul hierarchy, and twisting procedure.</description>

      <title>New invariants of stable equivalences of algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10848v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that stable equivalences between Artin algebras without nodes preserve homological data that provide upper bounds for finitistic dimension, and that stable equivalences between Artin algebras with positive $\nu$-dominant dimensions induce stable equivalences of their Frobenius parts. As an application of our new methods developed, we verify the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences for two rather different classes of algebras: principal centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields and Frobenius-finite algebras over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <title>Relatively big projective modules and their applications to direct sum decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Countably generated projective modules that are relatively big with respect to a trace ideal were introduced by P. P\v{r}\'ihoda, as an extension of Bass' uniformly big projectives. It has already been proved that there are a number of interesting examples of rings whose countably generated projective modules are always relatively big. In this paper, we increase the list of such examples, showing that it includes all right noetherian rings satisfying a polynomial identity.
  We also show that countably generated projective modules over locally semiperfect torsion-free algebras over $h$-local domains are always relatively big. This last result applies to endomorphism rings of finitely generated torsion-free modules over $h$-local domains. As a consequence, we can give a complete characterization of those $h$-local domains of Krull dimension $1$ for which every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of a single finitely generated torsion-free module is again a direct sum of finitely generated modules.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of unit groups of von Neumann's continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, if $R$ is a non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring, then its unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$, equipped with the topology generated by the rank metric, is topologically simple modulo its center, path-connected, locally path-connected, bounded in the sense of Bourbaki, and not admitting any non-zero escape function. All these topological insights are consequences of more refined geometric results concerning the rank metric, in particular with regard to the set of algebraic elements. Thanks to the phenomenon of automatic continuity, our results also have non-trivial ramifications for the underlying abstract groups.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories for a cotorsion pair, flat-type cotorsion pairs, and relative periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hereditary complete cotorsion pair $(\mathsf A,\mathsf B)$ generated by a set of objects in a Grothendieck category $\mathsf K$, we construct a natural equivalence between the Becker coderived category of the left-hand class $\mathsf A$ and the Becker contraderived category of the right-hand class $\mathsf B$. We show that a nested pair of cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf A_1,\mathsf B_1)\le(\mathsf A_2,\mathsf B_2)$ provides an adjunction between the related co/contraderived categories, which is induced by a Quillen adjunction between abelian model structures. Then we specialize to the cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ sandwiched between the projective and the flat cotorsion pairs in a module category, and prove that the related co/contraderived categories for $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ are the same as for the projective and flat cotorsion pairs if and only if two periodicity properties hold for $\mathsf F$ and $\mathsf C$. The same applies to the cotorsion pairs sandwiched between the very flat and the flat cotorsion pairs in the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme. More generally, we define and discuss cotorsion pairs of the very flat type and of the flat type in Grothendieck categories (as well as exact categories of the flat type), and work with a cotorsion pair sandwiched between one of the very flat type and one of the flat type. The motivating examples of the classes of flaprojective modules and relatively cotorsion modules for a ring homomorphism are discussed, and periodicity conjectures formulated for them.</description>
