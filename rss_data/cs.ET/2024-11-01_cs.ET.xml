      <title>On Heterogeneous Ising Machines</title>

Abstract: Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to and stabilizes at a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, was originally developed to explain dynamic behavior of ferromagnetic materials and was shown to generalize to numerous other physical systems. In a generic optimization problem, each variable can interact with another in different ways. At the same time, problem sizes of practical importance are growing very fast. Unfortunately, both the number and connectivity of spins in hardware are subject to fundamental physical limits. Different problems feature different interaction patterns between variables which may not always directly match the network topology supported by a specific Ising machine. In the presence of a mismatch, emulating generic interactions using the machine topology is usually possible, however, comes at the cost of additional physical spins to facilitate the mapping. Furthermore, mismatches in the problem vs. hardware connectivity render even more physical spins necessary. Combinatorial optimization problems of practical importance come with diverse connectivity patterns, which a rigid network topology in hardware cannot efficiently cover. To bridge the gap between application demand and hardware resources, in analogy to classical heterogeneous chip multiprocessors, in this paper we make the case for heterogeneous Ising multiprocessors, where each Ising core features a different connectivity. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the efficiency of different design options in terms of time or energy to solution along with solution accuracy compared to homogeneous alternatives.</description>

      <title>Practical Evaluation of Low-Frequency Vibration Energy Harvesting for Creating Green RFID and IoT Devices</title>

Abstract: One of the main limitations for the development and deployment of many Green Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems is the access to energy sources. In this aspect batteries are the main option to be used in energy constrained scenarios, but their use is limited to certain cases, either because of the constraints imposed by a reduced-form factor, their limited lifespan, or the characteristics of the environment itself (e.g. operating temperature, risk of burning, need for fast response, sudden voltage variations). In this regard, supercapacitors present an interesting alternative for the previously mentioned type of environment, although, due to their short-term capacity, they must be combined with an alternative energy supply mechanism. Energy harvesting mechanisms, in conjunction with ultra-low-power electronics, supercapacitors and various methods to improve the efficiency of communications, have enabled the emergence of battery-less passive electronic devices such as sensors, actuators or transmitters. This paper presents a novel analysis of the performance of an energy harvesting system based on vibrations for Green RFID and IoT applications in the field of maritime transport. The results show that the proposed system allows for charging half of a 1.2 F supercapacitor in about 72 minutes, providing a stable current of around 210 uA and a power output of 0.38 mW.</description>

      <title>Practical Evaluation of Wize and Bluetooth 5 Assisted RFID for an Opportunistic Vehicular Scenario</title>

Abstract: Wireless communications are critical in the constantly changing environment of IoT and RFID technologies, where thousands of devices can be deployed across a wide range of scenarios. Whether connecting to cloud servers or local fog/edge devices, maintaining seamless communications is difficult, especially in demanding contexts like industrial warehouses or remote rural areas. Opportunistic networks, when combined with edge devices, provide a possible solution to this challenge. These networks enable IoT devices, particularly mobile devices, to redirect information as it passes via other devices until it reaches an edge node. Using different communication protocols, this paper investigates their effects on response times and total messages received for a opportunistic assisted RFID system. Specifically, this article compares two communications technologies (Bluetooth 5 and Wize) when used for building a novel Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) identification system based on low-cost Single-Board Computers (SBCs). For such a comparison, measurements have been performed for quantifying packet loss and latency. The tests consisted in two experiments under identical conditions and scenarios, with a node located roadside, transmitting identification information, and a node located inside a moving vehicle that was driven at varying vehicle speeds. The obtained results show for Bluetooth 5 average latencies ranging between 700 and 950 ms with packet losses between 7% and 27%, whereas for Wize the average delay as between 150 and 370 ms with packet losses between 20% and 52%.</description>

      <title>Improving snore detection under limited dataset through harmonic/percussive source separation and convolutional neural networks</title>

Abstract: Snoring, an acoustic biomarker commonly observed in individuals with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), holds significant potential for diagnosing and monitoring this recognized clinical disorder. Irrespective of snoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns manifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we propose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring sounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using harmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature, based on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for conventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection performance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a large dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced training set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former scenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared to other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the proposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram derived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular scenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the performance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical input features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly demonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning of the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most snoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.</description>

      <title>A Cryogenic Memristive Neural Decoder for Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural decoders for quantum error correction (QEC) rely on neural networks to classify syndromes extracted from error correction codes and find appropriate recovery operators to protect logical information against errors. Its ability to adapt to hardware noise and long-term drifts make neural decoders a promising candidate for inclusion in a fault-tolerant quantum architecture. However, given their limited scalability, it is prudent that small-scale (local) neural decoders are treated as first stages of multi-stage decoding schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. In this case, minimizing the decoding time to match the stabilization measurements frequency and a tight co-integration with the QPUs is highly desired. Cryogenic realizations of neural decoders can not only improve the performance of higher stage decoders, but they can minimize communication delays, and alleviate wiring bottlenecks. In this work, we design and analyze a neural decoder based on an in-memory computation (IMC) architecture, where crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices are employed to both store the synaptic weights of the neural decoder and perform analog matrix-vector multiplications. In simulations supported by experimental measurements, we investigate the impact of TiOx-based memristive devices' non-idealities on decoding fidelity. We develop hardware-aware re-training methods to mitigate the fidelity loss, restoring the ideal decoder's pseudo-threshold for the distance-3 surface code. This work provides a pathway to scalable, fast, and low-power cryogenic IMC hardware for integrated fault-tolerant QEC.</description>

      <title>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm with random and subgraph phase operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA with custom phase operators at $p = 1$ and show numerically that some of these custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested at $p=1$, 0.036\% of the random custom phase operators, 75.9\% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1\% of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9\% of the maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA implementation. Furthermore, we numerically simulate these phase operators for $p=2$ and $p=3$ levels of QAOA and find that there exist a large number of subgraph, triangle-removed, and maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators that have a higher approximation ratio than QAOA at the same depth. These findings open up the question of whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the performance of QAOA.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</description>

      <title>Single Bridge Formation in Self-Organizing Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local interactions of uncoordinated individuals produce the collective behaviors of many biological systems, inspiring much of the current research in programmable matter. A striking example is the spontaneous assembly of fire ants into "bridges" comprising their own bodies to traverse obstacles and reach sources of food. Experiments and simulations suggest that, remarkably, these ants always form one bridge -- instead of multiple, competing bridges -- despite a lack of central coordination. We argue that the reliable formation of a single bridge does not require sophistication on behalf of the individuals by provably reproducing this behavior in a self-organizing particle system. We show that the formation of a single bridge by the particles is a statistical inevitability of their preferences to move in a particular direction, such as toward a food source, and their preference for more neighbors. Two parameters, $\eta$ and $\beta$, reflect the strengths of these preferences and determine the Gibbs stationary measure of the corresponding particle system's Markov chain dynamics. We show that a single bridge almost certainly forms when $\eta$ and $\beta$ are sufficiently large. Our proof introduces an auxiliary Markov chain, called an "occupancy chain," that captures only the significant, global changes to the system. Through the occupancy chain, we abstract away information about the motion of individual particles, but we gain a more direct means of analyzing their collective behavior. Such abstractions provide a promising new direction for understanding many other systems of programmable matter.</description>
