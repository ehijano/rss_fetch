      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>The source of the 2017 cosmic ray half-year modulation event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as FDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1 AU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a mini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Secondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and co-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.</description>

      <title>Estimating the impact of light pollution on quantum communication between QEYSSat and Canadian quantum ground station sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite to ground quantum communication typically operates at night to reduce background signals, however it remains susceptible to noise from light pollution of the night sky. In this study we compare several methodologies for determining whether a Quantum Ground Station (QGS) site is viable for exchanging quantum signals with the upcoming Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission. We conducted ground site characterization studies at three locations in Canada: Waterloo, Ontario, Calgary, Alberta, and Priddis, Alberta. Using different methods we estimate the background counts expected to leak into the satellite-ground quantum channel, and determined whether the noise levels could prevent a quantum key transfer. We also investigate how satellite data recorded from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can help estimate conditions of a particular site, and find reasonable agreement with the locally recorded data. Our results indicate that the Waterloo, Calgary, and Priddis QGS sites should allow both quantum uplinks and downlinks with QEYSSat, despite their proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, our approach allows the use of satellite borne instrument data (VIIRS) to remotely and efficiently determine the potential of a ground site.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Theory Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability of Parker's Steady Solar Wind Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a novel optimal theoretical framework based on potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics which provides a smooth extrapolation of Parker's steady solar wind model to the unsteady case. The viability of this framework is illustrated by providing the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to successfully address the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point (where the solar wind flow velocity equals the speed of sound in the gas) in the linear stability problem of Parker's steady solar wind solution. This development involves going outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporating the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system, and hence provides an appropriate nonlinear recipe to regularize this singularity. The stability of Parker's steady wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by analyzing the concomitant nonlinear problem. The new theoretical framework given here seems, therefore, to have the potential to provide a viable basis for future formulations addressing various theoretical aspects of Parker's unsteady solar wind model.</description>

      <title>The 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm may have caused the premature reentry of a Starlink satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short communication, we qualitatively analyze possible effects of the 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm on accelerating the reentry of a Starlink satellite from very low-Earth orbit (VLEO). The storm took place near the maximum of solar cycle (SC) 25, which has shown to be more intense than SC24. Based on preliminary geomagnetic indices, the 10 October 2024, along with the 10 May 2024, were the most intense events since the well-known Halloween storms of October/November 2003. By looking at a preliminary version of the Dst index and altitudes along with velocities extracted from two-line element (TLE) data of the Starlink-1089 (SL-1089) satellite, we observe a possible connection between storm main phase onset and a sharp decay of SL-1089. The satellite was predicted to reenter on 22 October, but it reentered on 12 October, 10 days before schedule. The sharp altitude decay of SL-1089 revealed by TLE data coincides with the storm main phase onset. We compare the de-orbiting altitudes of another three satellites during different geomagnetic conditions and observe that the day difference between actual and predicted reentries increases for periods with higher geomagnetic activity. Therefore, we call for future research to establish the eventual causal relationship between storm occurrence and satellite orbital decay. As predicted by previous works, SC25 is already producing extreme geomagnetic storms with unprecedented satellite orbital drag effects and consequences for current megaconstellations in VLEO.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Gas Effects in Parker's Solar Wind Model and Coronal Hole Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed and systematic investigation of polytropic gas effects in Parker's solar wind model and coronal-hole flows is given. We present a viable equation governing the acceleration of solar wind of a polytropic gas and give its exact analytical and numerical solutions and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties (i) near the sun, (ii) far away from the sun, (iii) near the Parker sonic critical point (where the wind speed is equal to the speed of sound in the wind). We proceed to give a detailed and systematic investigation of coronal-hole polytropic gas outflows which contribute to bulk of the solar wind. We will model coronal-hole outflow by considering a single radial stream tube and invoke phenomenological considerations to represent its rapidly-diverging flow geometry. We give analytical and numerical solutions for this outflow and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties in the three flow regimes above. We find that, in general, the polytropic effects cause the Parker sonic critical point to move closer to the sun than that for the case with isothermal gas. Furthermore, the flow acceleration is found to exhibit (even for an infinitesimal deviation from isothermality of the gas) a power-law behavior rather than an exponential-law behavior near the sun or a logarithmic-law behavior far away from the sun, thus implying a certain robustness of the power-law behavior. The Parker sonic critical point is shown to continue to be of X-type, hence facilitating a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic wind flow through the transonic regime. Our analytical and numerical solutions for coronal-hole outflows show that the super-radiality of the stream tube causes the Parker sonic critical point to move further down in the corona, and the gas to become more diabatic (the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ drops further below 5/3), and the flow acceleration to be enhanced further.</description>
