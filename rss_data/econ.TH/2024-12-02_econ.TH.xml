      <title>Dynamic matching games: stationary equilibria under varying commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines equilibria in dynamic two-sided matching games, extending Gale and Shapley's foundational model to a non-cooperative, decentralized, and dynamic framework. We focus on markets where agents have utility functions and commitments vary. Specifically, we analyze a dynamic matching game in which firms make offers to workers in each period, considering three types of commitment: (i) no commitment from either side, (ii) firms' commitment, and (iii) workers' commitment. Our results demonstrate that stable matchings can be supported as stationary equilibria under different commitment scenarios, depending on the strategies adopted by firms and workers. Furthermore, we identify key conditions, such as discount factors, that influence agents' decisions to switch partners, thereby shaping equilibrium outcomes.</description>

      <title>Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by money-burning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages and burns money. We characterize the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff, which has clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion. We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic \emph{strictly} improves the sender's payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the commitment value within these contexts.</description>

      <title>Condorcet-Consistent Choice Among Three Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates. For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements of maximin, a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785), are immune to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of its refinements, Nanson's rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for three-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Cycle: A "Dynamic" Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel equilibrium concept, called the equilibrium cycle, which seeks to capture the outcome of oscillatory game dynamics. Unlike the (pure) Nash equilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, an equilibrium cycle is a set-valued solution concept that can be demonstrated even in games where best responses do not exist (for example, in discontinuous games). The equilibrium cycle identifies a Cartesian product set of action profiles that satisfies three important properties: stability against external deviations, instability against internal deviations, and minimality. This set-valued equilibrium concept generalizes the classical notion of the minimal curb set to discontinuous games. In finite games, the equilibrium cycle is related to strongly connected sink components of the best response graph.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Assumptions for the Existence of a General Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General Equilibrium Theory is the benchmark of economics, especially its results concerning the efficient allocation of resources, known as the First and Second Welfare Theorems. Yet, General Equilibrium Theory is beyond the scope of most economists. This paper is pitched as the first entry point into the theory. General Equilibrium Theory proves that at least one state of equilibrium always exists. In its most general approach, it uses fixed-point theorems to this end. This paper discusses the assumptions on individuals' behaviour and the structure of the system of exchange that guarantee that the conditions of the fixed-point theorems are satisfied. The purpose is to lay bare the role each plays in proving the existence of equilibrium and provide a clear picture of the relationship between the assumptions and the result. The discussion is presented in the simplest possible setting that captures the fundamental features of commodity exchange.</description>
