      <title>Democratizing Scalable Cloud Applications: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web applications underpin much of modern digital life, yet building scalable and consistent cloud applications remains difficult, requiring expertise across cloud computing, distributed systems, databases, and software engineering. These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.
  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.
  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.
  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation with Structured Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying accurate Text-to-SQL systems at the enterprise level faces a difficult trilemma involving cost, security and performance. Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.</description>

      <title>Multi-granularity Spatiotemporal Flow Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing flow of objects or data at different granularities of space and time can unveil interesting insights or trends. For example, transportation companies, by aggregating passenger travel data (e.g., counting passengers traveling from one region to another), can analyze movement behavior. In this paper, we study the problem of finding important trends in passenger movements between regions at different granularities. We define Origin (O), Destination (D), and Time (T ) patterns (ODT patterns) and propose a bottom-up algorithm that enumerates them. We suggest and employ optimizations that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern enumeration. We also propose pattern variants (constrained patterns and top-k patterns) that could be useful to different applications scenarios. Finally, we propose an approximate solution that fast identifies ODT patterns of specific sizes, following a generate-and-test approach. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods on three real datasets and showcase interesting ODT flow patterns in them.</description>

      <title>Text-to-SQL Task-oriented Dialogue Ontology Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch using only its inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with concepts from modular TOD systems provided in the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of modular TOD system concepts. TeQoDO also scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on a Wikipedia and arXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader application of ontologies.</description>
