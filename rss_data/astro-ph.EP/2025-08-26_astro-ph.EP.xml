      <title>Estimating the Local Hubble Parameter from the Thermal Evolution of Earth and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a long time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular interest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the Solar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Entropy Calculations of Water Predict the Interiors of Uranus and Neptune to be 15-30% Colder than Previous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio free energy calculations are employed to derive the entropy of liquid and superionic water over a wide range of conditions in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. The resulting adiabats are much shallower in pressure-temperature space than those adopted for earlier models of Uranus and Neptune. Our models for their interiors are thus much colder, increasing the likelihood that diamond rain or the recently predicted phase separation of planetary ices has occurred in the mantles of ice giant planets. Based on our ab initio data, we construct interior models for Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method that match the existing gravity measurements. We compare fully convective models with models that include a convective boundary between liquid and superionic water. We also share a code to characterize giant planet atmospheres where para and ortho hydrogen as well as helium are present.</description>

      <title>Soot Planets instead of Water Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disc, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon ("soot"). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.</description>

      <title>The HD 60779 Planetary System: A Transiting Sub-Neptune on a 30-day Orbit and a More Massive Outer World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the planetary system orbiting the bright (V = 7.2), nearby (35 pc), Sun-like star HD 60779, which has a mass of 1.050 +/- 0.044 solar masses and a radius of 1.129 +/- 0.013 solar radii. We report two TESS transits and a subsequent CHEOPS transit of HD 60779 b, a sub-Neptune with a radius of 3.250 (+0.100 / -0.098) Earth radii on a 29.986175 (+0.000030 / -0.000033) day orbit. Additionally, 286 HARPS-N radial velocity measurements reveal the mass of planet b (14.7 +1.1 / -1.0 Earth masses) and the presence of an outer planet, HD 60779 c, with an orbital period of 104.25 (+0.30 / -0.29) days and a minimum mass (m sin i) of 27.7 +/- 1.6 Earth masses. Both planets' orbits are consistent with being circular, suggesting that they have a dynamically quiet history. The data are not sufficient to determine whether planet c transits. HD 60779's uniquely high systemic radial velocity (129.75 +/- 0.12 km/s) allows its Lyman-alpha emission to avoid absorption by the interstellar medium, making it a prime candidate for probing atmospheric escape from HD 60779 b. HD 60779 is also the third-brightest host of a sub-Neptune with orbital period greater than 25 days and with both mass and radius measured, distinguishing it in terms of accessibility to spectroscopic characterization.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Salacia-Actaea and M\'ani: Exploring Population-level Trends among Water-ice-rich Kuiper Belt Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the mid-sized Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) Salacia-Actaea and M\'ani, obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on JWST. The satellite Actaea was fully blended with Salacia at the spatial resolution of the integral field unit, and we extracted the combined spectrum. The 0.7-5.1 ${\mathrm \mu}$m reflectance spectra of Salacia-Actaea and M\'ani display prominent water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4-5 ${\mathrm \mu}$m. The $\nu_3$ fundamental vibrational band of carbon dioxide ice at 4.25 ${\mathrm \mu}$m is present in both spectra. From a quantitative band-depth analysis of the entire current JWST spectroscopic sample of water-ice-rich KBOs, we find strong evidence for a positive covariance between relative water-ice abundance and size, which may indicate the emergent impacts of internal differentiation and cryovolcanic production of surface water ice on mid-sized KBOs. A detailed look at the distribution of 2- and 3-${\mathrm \mu}$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as different water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition in the carbon dioxide band depth at diameters of roughly 300-500 km, with larger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection effects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a size-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class. The band shape of the carbon dioxide feature also varies with size: while small KBOs have narrow bands centered at ~4.27 ${\mathrm \mu}$m, the largest objects have broader, blue-shifted features that may include contributions from carbon dioxide in an irradiated, mixed, and/or layered state.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Second Y+Y Dwarf Binary System: CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a companion to the Y-dwarf, CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3, the second Y-Y dwarf binary detected to date. Y-dwarfs are the coldest known free-floating objects ($&lt;$ 500 K) and on average represent the lowest mass objects directly formed through turbulent fragmentation of a molecular cloud. Studying their multiplicity allows us to place strong constraints on the ability to form multiple systems of planetary masses and approaching the opacity limit of fragmentation. Due to their physical properties, Y-dwarfs also serve as analogs to gas giant planets. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 has been shown to have a unique methane emission feature in its near infrared spectrum at 3.326 $\mu$m, potentially indicative of auroral processes without a clear origin. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 was observed with JWST's MIRI in the F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W filters. We applied a point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm using empirically derived PSF models and resolve a companion in the F1000W and F1280W filters separated by 172 milli-arcseconds, 2.48 au assuming the distance of 14.43 pc. Using the ATMO2020 evolutionary models, we estimate a mass of 12-39 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the primary and 7-24 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the companion assuming an age of 1-10 Gyr for a mass ratio of 0.55-0.62, resulting in an estimated period of 16-28 years. It is unknown which component of this binary exhibits the methane emission feature. We also resolve known companions WISE J014656.66+423410.0B and WISE J171104.60+350036.8B using MIRI data and present their F1000W and F1280W photometry.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Rotation Periods: Statistical Analysis in the Diameter-Spin Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the rotational characteristics of asteroids through statistical modeling of the diameter-period relationship. A statistical evaluation of the diameter-period relationship was conducted using a dataset of 34,326 asteroids. Clustering identified three main groups, including a dense cluster below the spin barrier, a population of small, fast-rotating asteroids, and a more diffuse group. Geometric and density-based analyses showed that the densest region consists of objects with diameters from 3 to 10 km and rotation periods between 3 and 9 hours, some of which extend beyond the spin barrier. Polynomial modeling demonstrated that a third-degree fit provides the most stable representation of the overall trend without overfitting. Additionally, an empirical lower boundary was identified and proposed, below which no asteroid was found in either the main sample or the selected targets.</description>

      <title>Latitudinal dependence of heat transport in turbulent geostrophic convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latitudinal variations in turbulent heat flux play a key role in the thermal and magnetic evolution of rapidly rotating planets and stars. Although global spherical-shell simulations have documented such variations, explicit latitude-dependent scaling relations for heat transport have remained elusive. Here we employ the rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRBC) framework with tilted rotation and gravity axes to model convection at different latitudes $\varphi$ in the geostrophic regime. We derive scaling relations for the latitude dependence of convective length scales $\ell(\varphi)$ and the Nusselt number $Nu(\varphi)$. At high latitudes, the scalings $Nu \sim \sin^{-4/3}\varphi$ (near onset) and $Nu \sim \sin^{-4}\varphi$ (above onset) emerge, while at low latitudes $Nu \sim \cos^{4}\varphi$. These predictions are validated against direct numerical simulations of convection in a spherical shell. The results provide a quantitative framework for regional thermal transport in planetary and stellar interiors and establish a unified interpretation of spherical convection that connects naturally with planar RRBC turbulence.</description>

      <title>Core-mantle partitioning and the bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon: Implications for their origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determined the metal/silicate partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon, DH and DC, simultaneously under typical conditions of Earth's core formation. Experiments demonstrate that both DH and DC diminish in the presence of carbon and hydrogen, respectively, indicating their strong interactions in liquid metal. With these partitioning data, we investigated the core and bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon based on core formation scenarios that are compatible with the bulk silicate Earth composition and the mass fraction and density deficit of the core. The results of the single-stage core formation modelling are markedly different from those using DH and DC individually determined in earlier experiments, indicating that the Earth building blocks do not match enstatite chondrites in water abundance and require contributions by carbonaceous chondrites. The multi-stage core formation models combined with an Earth accretion scenario accounting for isotopic composition show 0.18-0.49 wt% H and 0.19-1.37 wt% C in the core, leading to 0.53-1.40 wt% H2O (present as H in the core) and 0.07-0.44 wt% C in the bulk Earth. Our modelling also demonstrates that up to 53% and 72% of Earth's water (hydrogen) and carbon, respectively, could have been derived from non-carbonaceous chondritic materials.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and destruction of PAHs and PAH clusters induced by absorption of X-rays in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only 8% of the protoplanetary discs orbiting a T Tauri star show emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As PAHs are strong absorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs photosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc, and their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of photo-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution of PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the absence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed because of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can withstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays by PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise PAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo model, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers. Furthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of PAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small PAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH molecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation and will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH clusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results, we expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM abundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small clusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance, replenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters remain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features because of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radial velocity measurements of the star HD 28471, observed by HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope over a baseline of $\sim19$ years. We have searched for planetary companions to HD 28471 using kima, a trans-dimensional diffusive nested sampling algorithm where the number of planetary signals is explored as a free parameter. We detect a compact system of three planets, with signals in the preferred solution corresponding to orbits of $P\sim3.16,~6.12,~\textrm{and }11.68$ d. These planets lie firmly in the super-Earth and sub-Neptune mass regime, with (minimum) masses of $3.7, 5.7, \textrm{and }4.9$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. A long-period ($\sim1500$ d) signal is also strongly detected. Assessment of activity indicator periodicities and RV correlations suggests that the three short-period signals are genuine planets, but casts doubt upon the nature of the long-period signal. The origin may be a short stellar magnetic cycle, though additional data are required to fully sample the periodicity without intervening offsets. HD 28471 b exhibits a more eccentric orbit than the other planets, which may be due to dynamical interaction, or a result of RV variation from an as-yet-undetected 4th planet interior to this compact system. The detected planets lie close to a resonant configuration, indicating that the system may retain features of its natal configuration, with convergent migration potentially responsible for evolving the planets onto such short-period orbits.</description>

Abstract: A key challenge in modeling (exo)planetary atmospheres lies in generating extensive opacity datasets that cover the wide variety of possible atmospheric composition, pressure, and temperature conditions. This critical step requires specific knowledge and can be considerably time-consuming. To circumvent this issue, most available codes approximate the total opacity by summing the contributions of individual molecular species during the radiative transfer calculation. This approach neglects inter-species interactions, which can be an issue for precisely estimating the climate of planets. To produce accurate opacity data, such as correlated-k tables, chi factor corrections of the far-wings of the line profile are required. We propose an update of the chi factors of CO$_2$ absorption lines that are relevant for terrestrial planets (pure CO$_2$, CO$_2$-N$_2$ and CO$_2$-H$_2$O). These new factors are already implemented in an original user-friendly open-source tool designed to calculate high resolution spectra, named SpeCT. The latter enables to produce correlated-k tables for mixtures made of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and N$_2$, accounting for inter-species broadening. In order to facilitate future updates of these chi factors, we also provide a review of all the relevant laboratory measurements available in the literature for the considered mixtures. Finally, we provide in this work 8 different correlated-k tables and continua for pure CO$_2$, CO$_2$-N$_2$, CO$_2$-H$_2$O and CO$_2$-H$_2$O-N$_2$ mixtures based on the MT_CKD formalism (for H$_2$O), and calculated using SpeCT. These opacity data can be used to study various planets and atmospheric conditions, such as Earth's paleo-climates, Mars, Venus, Magma ocean exoplanets, telluric exoplanets.</description>

      <title>TOI-2322: two transiting rocky planets close to the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Active regions on the stellar surface can induce quasi-periodic radial velocity (RV) variations that can mimic planets and mask true planetary signals. These spurious signals can be problematic for RV surveys such as those carried out by the ESPRESSO consortium.
  Aims. Using ESPRESSO and HARPS RVs and activity indicators, we aim to confirm and characterize two candidate transiting planets from TESS orbiting a K4 star with strong activity signals.
  Methods. From the ESPRESSO FWHM, TESS photometry, and ASAS-SN photometry, we measure a stellar rotation period of 21.28 $\pm$ 0.08 d. We jointly model the TESS photometry, ESPRESSO and HARPS RVs, and activity indicators, applying a multivariate Gaussian Process (GP) framework to the spectroscopic data.
  Results. We are able to disentangle the planetary and activity components, finding that TOI-2322 b has a $11.307170^{+0.000085}_{-0.000079}$ d period, close to the first harmonic of the rotation period, a $\leq 2.03 M_\oplus$ mass upper limit and a $0.994^{+0.057}_{-0.059}$ $\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ radius. TOI-2322 c orbits close to the stellar rotation period, with a $20.225528^{+0.000039}_{-0.000044}$ d period; it has a $18.10^{+4.34}_{-5.36}$ $\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ mass and a $1.874^{+0.066}_{-0.057}$ $\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ radius.
  Conclusions. The multivariate GP framework is crucial to separating the stellar and planetary signals, significantly outperforming a one-dimensional GP. Likewise, the transit data is fundamental to constraining the periods and epochs, enabling the retrieval of the planetary signals in the RVs. The internal structure of TOI-2322 c is very similar to that of Earth, making it one of the most massive planets with an Earth-like composition known.</description>

      <title>New and updated long-periodic terms in harmonic development of the Earth tide-generating potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new harmonic development of the long-periodic band of the Earth tide-generating potential (TGP). It updates the corresponding part of the previous TGP expansion, KSM03 (Kudryavtsev, J. Geodesy, 77:829, 2004), and includes 38 terms of period longer than $\simeq$18 years (yr) and amplitude not less than $10^{-8}~{\rm m}^2\,{\rm s}^{-2}$. The development is made through a modified spectral analysis of the TGP numerical values tabulated over more than 30,000 yr (13,200~BC--17,191~AD). The latest JPL NASA's long-term numerical ephemeris DE441 (Park et al., Astron. J., 161:105, 2021) is used as the source of the Moon, the Sun and major planets coordinates. For comparison, the KSM03 series were done on the basis of an older DE406 ephemeris (Standish, JPL IOM 312.F, 1998) and over a shorter time interval of 2000 yr (1000--3000).
  As a result of using an extended time span several new long-periodic waves in the Earth TGP are found and most of other terms are updated. In particular, a relatively large term of amplitude of $3\times 10^{-5}~{\rm m}^2\,{\rm s}^{-2}$ and period of $\simeq$7.4~kyr is revealed. Several new waves of period close to 18.61 yr (the period of the lunar nodal cycle, LNC) are separated from the main LNC term. The effect of the general precession in longitude (of $\simeq$25.7~kyr period) on the Earth TGP for the first time is evaluated. As a result, a number of updated TGP terms include the precession rate in their arguments.
  A new catalogue of the long-periodic terms in the Earth TGP spectrum in both standard HW95 and KSM03 format is released.</description>

      <title>Gas and dust dynamics in $\gamma$ Cephei-type disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Giant planets are observed orbiting the primary stars of close binary systems. Such planets may have formed in compact circumprimary disks, under conditions much different than those around single stars. To quantify the effects of the strong gravitational perturbations exerted on circumprimary disk material, the 3D dynamics of gas and dust in orbit around the primary star of a compact and eccentric binary was modeled by using gamma Cephei as a representative of a class of close binary systems. Circumprimary gas was approximated as an Eulerian viscous and compressible fluid. Dust grains were modeled as Lagrangean particles, subjected to gravity and drag forces. Some models also include a giant planet. Models show that spiral density waves excited around pericenter passage propagate toward the inner disk boundary, through a few pressure scaleheights from the midplane, inducing radial and vertical mixing in the gas. However, perturbations imparted to gas, both in terms of eccentricity and precession, are far weaker than previously estimated by 2D simulations. Models predict small eccentricities, &lt;~ 0.03, and slow retrograde precession. The addition of a giant planet does not change the low eccentricity state of the disk. The parameters applied to the disk would lead to the formation of a planet many times the mass of Jupiter, in agreement with some observations. Micron to mm-size dust grains are well coupled to the gas, resulting in similar dynamics and statistically similar distributions of orbital elements. The planet only affects the dust distributions locally. In agreement with results of recent 2D models, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disk would be brief, ~1e5 years, due to its compact nature, requiring a long-term external supply of mass to allow for the in situ formation of a giant planet.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. IV. Confirming an 89 d, $m\sin i=10~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ Planet Orbiting a Nearby Sun-like Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the confirmation of HD 190360 d, a warm ($P=88.690^{+0.051}_{-0.049}~\mathrm{d}$), low-mass ($m\sin i=10.23^{+0.81}_{-0.80}~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$) planet orbiting the nearby ($d=16.0$ pc), Sun-like (G7) star HD 190360. We detect HD 190360 d at high statistical significance even though its radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude is only $K=1.48\pm0.11~\mathrm{m~s^{-1}}$. Such low-amplitude signals are often challenging to confirm due to potential confusion with low-amplitude stellar signals. The HD 190360 system previously had two known planets: the $1.7~\mathrm{M_J}$ (true mass) HD 190360 b on a $7.9$ yr orbit and the $21~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (minimum mass) HD 190360 c on a $17.1$ d orbit. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the HD 190360 planetary system that comprises more than 30 years of RV measurements and absolute astrometry from the Hipparcos and Gaia spacecrafts. Our analysis uses more than 1400 RVs, including nearly 100 from NEID. The proper motion anomaly as measured by these two astrometric missions solves for the dynamical mass of HD 190360 b and contributes to our understanding of the overall system architecture, while the long baseline of RVs enables the robust characterization of HD 190360 c and confirms the discovery of HD 190360 d.</description>

      <title>JWST detection of a carbon dioxide dominated gas coma surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 6.1-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>

      <title>Free-floating Planets Produced by Planet-Planet Scatterings: Ejection Velocity and Survival Rate of Their Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of numerous free-floating planets (FFPs) has intensified interest in their origins and dynamical histories. A leading formation mechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems, which can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally host moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain gravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both the ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the survival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining the statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection, and comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host planet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an analytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy conservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a minimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems with finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to determine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial semi-major axis. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer insights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for exomoons around them.</description>

      <title>Exploration of vertical self-resonant bifurcations from DRO in the Earth-Moon CR3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate vertical self-resonant (VSR) bifurcations from distant retrograde orbit (DRO) family in the framework of the Earth-Moon CR3BP. To this end, by using a classical corrector-predictor algorithm we compute the vertical stability of DROs and identify twelve vertical-critical DROs. We split them into three groups according to orbiting around libration points $L_i$, $i=1,2,4,5$. (i) We first analyze six VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to ten associated to DROs near the Moon. (ii) For DROs that move in addition around $L_1$ and $L_2$, we study four VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to eight. (iii) Within DROs additionally orbiting also around $L_4$ and $L_5$, two vertical 1:1 resonant branch points occur. In total, we generate 21 bifurcated families of spatial symmetric periodic solutions and present their orbital characteristics, including bridge families to Butterfly, prograde orbits, quasi DRO and DRO. We also obtain branches whose members approach collision with the Moon and are of Bumble Bee, Hoverfly or Dragonfly shape. In order to provide a structured and systematic overview of such bifurcation results, we determine Conley-Zehnder indices and construct bifurcation diagrams in view of symplectic invariants.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Silicate Grain Coagulation on Millimeter Emission from Massive Protostellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot accretion disks around massive protostars provide a unique opportunity to study ice-free silicate grains that cannot be investigated in protoplanetary disks. We conduct a self-consistent investigation into grain-size evolution and its impact on (sub)millimeter-wave emission from massive protostellar disks. Our radiative transfer modeling accounts for dust self-scattering and includes vertical temperature gradients in the disk structure. The results show that once silicate grains grow to sizes exceeding the observing wavelength, enhanced scattering dims the disk emission by 20\%--30\% relative to the blackbody emission expected at the disk surface temperature. By comparing our model with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.14 mm observations of the disk around the massive protostar GGD27-MM1, we constrain the threshold velocity for collisional fragmentation of silicate grains to approximately 15 m s-1. This fragmentation velocity is lower than the typical maximum collisional velocities in protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, suggesting that collisional coagulation alone is insufficient for silicate dust to form rocky planetesimals in such environments. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two potential scenarios to better reproduce the bright inner-disk emission of GGD27-MM1. One possibility is that the grain growth is limited to 160 mum by another growth barrier (e.g., collisional bouncing), reducing scattering dimming. Alternatively, the stellar luminosity may be as much as five times higher than current estimates, compensating for the reduced brightness. Future multiwavelength observations, particularly at shorter submillimeter wavelengths, will be crucial to distinguish between these scenarios and further constrain silicate grain coagulation processes in massive protostellar disks.</description>

      <title>An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, it remains difficult to distinguish these low signal-to-noise planets from the false alarms originating from correlated and non-Gaussian noise. It reduces the resulting planetary catalog reliability and makes it hard to measure the occurrence rate of small long-period planets. We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small long-period planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve their occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline for small (Kepler Multiple-Event Statistic, MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planets. It designs and implements a detection statistic that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. For every threshold-crossing event, it runs permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of it being caused by a real planet. The provided detection statistic has a tail-less background distribution with a rate of ~1 false alarm per search for MES~7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of ~7.5-9 and $&gt;$4 transits due to the background distribution control. The pipeline was tested to be able to detect most of the faint Confirmed Kepler planets. The pipeline was applied to the entirety of Kepler data and detected ~50 candidate events with a high probability of originating from real planets, which will be presented in our future work.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): II. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Ophiuchus Star-forming Region</title>

Abstract: The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (&gt;70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (&gt;60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VI. Comparison of Dust Evolution Models to AGE-PRO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency analysis of the ALMA and VLA high resolution continuum observations of the substructured disc around CI Tau. Preference for sub-mm-sized low-porosity amorphous carbon grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths &lt;3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (&lt; 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (&lt; 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.</description>

Abstract: With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivity estimates to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, predicting Hyper-K can reach spin dependent cross sections as low as $\sigma_{p\chi}^{\mathrm{SD}}=2\times 10^{-35}\mathrm{cm}^2$ for DM masses below 2 GeV. This surpasses current solar limits and direct detection results. We additionally provide estimates for Super-K ORCA, and the IceCube-Upgrade, showing that these experiments could provide complimentary bounds to direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. The amplitude of initial perturbations, $Pm$ and domain aspect ratio play a key role in the onset and evolution of the dynamo. It exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in various astrophysical objects with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Energetic ($&lt;$ 2 MeV) ion fluxes measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11 - 19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1--2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of ICME-generated solar energetic particles (SEPs) and substorm generated energetic ions on the magnetosphere. We approach this objective by detailed spectral analyses of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z$ = 0, $&gt;$ 0, and $&lt;$ 0) and use the derived spectral indices to understand this relative role. By combining these with the simultaneous energetic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the ICME-generated SEP with the energetic particles generated inside the magnetosphere by substorms. Interestingly, ASPEX-STEPS observations also indicate towards directional anisotropy based on spectral indices. This suggests spatially inhomogeneous mixing of energetic ions coming from different source processes.</description>
