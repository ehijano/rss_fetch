      <title>Response of wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers to ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of characterizing the response and light transport of wavelength-shifting (WLS) and scintillating-wavelength-shifting (Sci-WLS) fibers under irradiation by radioactive $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ sources. Light yield and light transmission were measured for the WLS fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain and for a new Sci-WLS fiber EJ-160 from Eljen Technology.
  The two variants with different fluor mixtures, EJ-160I and EJ-160II, exhibited approximately five and seven times higher light yield than BCF-91A, respectively, while their attenuation lengths were 3.80\,m for BCF-91A, 4.00\,m for EJ-160I, and 2.50\,m for EJ-160II.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Ionization quenching factors and W-values of low-energy H_2^+ and He^+ ions in Ar gas at low pressure measured with a bulk resistive MICROMEGAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization quenching factor, the fraction of an ion's initial kinetic energy lost through ionization in a medium, was measured for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions within the 2.5-5 keV energy range in an Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixture at pressures between 75 and 150 mbar. The mixture was contained in the active volume of a MICROMEGAS type Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD), which was connected to an ion source via a high vacuum system. The results showed a significant decrease in ionization as the ion energy decreased, although no dependence on gas pressure was observed within the low pressure range studied. Additionally, significant deviations from the predictions of SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) simulations were found. These measurements also allowed the first determination of $W$ values (the average energy required to create an electron-ion pair in the gas) for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions in Ar at this particular energy range, which had not been previously explored for these projectile-target combinations. These findings are essential for accurate ion energy reconstruction in low-pressure MPGDs, with particular relevance for space-based energetic neutral atom detection, as proposed by the Italian Space Agency's SWEATERS project.</description>

      <title>Measurement of radon concentration in the output water of the 100~t/h ultrapure water system at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose low background liquid scintillator detector, was proposed primarily to determine the neutrino mass ordering. To mitigate radioactivity from surrounding rock and enable cosmic muon tagging, its central detector is immersed in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) containing 40~ktons of ultrapure water instrumented with 2400 20-inch micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. Stringent radiopurity requirements mandate a radon concentration below 10 ~mBq/m$^3$ in the WCD. To achieve this, we developed a two-stage (ground and underground) ultrapure water system with 100~t/h production capacity, integrating a five-stage degassing membrane for radon removal. A novel microbubble technique was implemented to optimize the degassing membranes' radon removal efficiency. The synergistic combination of the microbubble technology and the multistage degassing membranes achieved a radon removal efficiency exceeding 99.9\%, reducing the system's output to 0.61 $\pm$ 0.50~mBq/m$^3$ in recirculation mode, surpassing design specifications and establishing world-leading performance standards. This paper details the ultrapure system architecture, quantifies the radon contributions of each device, and presents a comprehensive study on microbubble-augmented membrane degassing for low radon ultra-pure water production in a 100~t/h water system.</description>

      <title>Leakage current of high-fluence neutron-irradiated 8" silicon sensors for the CMS Endcap Calorimeter Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HL-LHC will challenge the detectors with a nearly 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity compared to the previous LHC runs combined, thus the CMS detector will be upgraded to face the higher levels of radiation and the larger amounts of collision data to be collected. The High-Granularity Calorimeter will replace the current endcap calorimeters of the CMS detector. It will facilitate the use of particle-flow calorimetry with its unprecedented transverse and longitudinal readout/trigger segmentation, with more than 6M readout channels. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the HGCAL (fluences above $10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$) will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 m$^2$. Fluences up to $10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 1.5 MGy are expected. The sensors are processed on novel 8" p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\mu{}m$, 200 $\mu{}m$ and 120 $\mu{}m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. Each sensor contains several hundred individually read out cells of two sizes (around 0.6 cm$^2$ or 1.2 cm$^2$). To investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, the sensors have been irradiated with neutrons at RINSC to fluences between $6.5 \times 10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and $1.4 \times 10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization results are presented for full sensors, as well as for partial sensors cut from multi-geometry wafers with internal dicing lines on the HV potential within the active sensor area. Leakage current behaviour is investigated for various sensor types and fluence levels, including its temperature dependence. Finally, methods to limit the annealing time of the sensors during irradiation are investigated by analysing the impact of splitting high-fluence irradiations.</description>

      <title>Energy calibration of bulk events in the BULLKID detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BULLKID is a cryogenic, solid-state detector designed for direct searches of particle Dark Matter candidates, with mass $\lesssim 1$ GeV/c$^2$, and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. It is based on an array of dice carved in 5 mm thick silicon crystal, sensed by phonon-mediated Kinetic Inductance Detectors. In previous works, the array was calibrated with bursts of optical photons, which are absorbed in the first hundreds nanometers of the dice and give rise to surface events. In this work, we present the reconstruction of bulk events through the 59.5 keV $\gamma$-ray generated by an $^{241}$Am source, which emulates more closely the interaction of Dark Matter and neutrinos. The peak resolution is $5\%~(\sigma)$ and its position is shifted by less than $10\%$ with respect to the optical calibration. We observe that the resolution is further improved by a factor $2$ combining the signal from neighboring dice. These results confirm the performance of the detector in view of the physics goals of the BULLKID-DM experiment for dark matter search.</description>

      <title>Activities of the Korea ALICE group for the development and production of the next-generation silicon tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALICE 3 is the proposed next-generation heavy-ion experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), envisioned for operation during Run 5. The tracking system of ALICE 3 will consist of a high-precision vertex detector integrated into a retractable structure inside the beam pipe, complemented by a large-area outer tracker covering a broad pseudorapidity range. Both systems will be based on the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, building upon the developments realized for the recently upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS2) and the future ITS3 upgrade. The total silicon area of the ALICE 3 tracking system is expected to be approximately five times larger than that of ITS2, presenting significant challenges in terms of large-scale sensor testing and module production. To address these challenges, research and development activities have been initiated in Korea, including the adaptation of an automated die-attach machine, commonly used in the semiconductor packaging industry, for efficient sensor-to-substrate assembly. This contribution presents the ongoing efforts of the Korea ALICE group toward the development and production of the ALICE 3 silicon tracker. The scope includes sensor evaluation, automated assembly techniques, and prototype module construction, with the aim of establishing scalable procedures for future mass production.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Readout System Design for the BULLKID-DM Experiment: Enhancing Dark Matter Search Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BULLKID-DM experiment aims to detect WIMP-like potential Dark Matter particles with masses below 1 GeV/c^2. Sensing these particles is challenging, as it requires nuclear recoil detectors characterized by high exposure and an energy threshold in the order of 100 eV, thus exceeding the capabilities of conventional semiconductor detectors. BULLKID-DM intends to tackle this challenge by using cryogenic Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with exceptional energy thresholds to sense a target with a total mass of 800 g across 16 wafers, divided into over 2000 individually instrumented silicon dice. The MKIDs on each wafer are coupled to a single transmission line and read using a frequency division multiplexing approach by the room-temperature data acquisition.
  In this contribution, we describe and assess the design of the room-temperature readout electronics system, including the selected hardware components and the FPGA firmware which contains the real-time signal processing stages for tone generation, frequency demultiplexing, and event triggering. We evaluate the system on the ZCU216 board, a commercial evaluation card built around a Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) with integrated high-speed DACs and ADCs, and connected it to a custom-designed analog front-end for signal conditioning.</description>

      <title>CE$\nu$NS Search with Cryogenic Sapphire Detectors at MINER: Results from the TRIGA reactor data and Future Sensitivity at HFIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) using cryogenic sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$) detectors deployed at the Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER), located near the 1~MW$_\text{th}$ TRIGA research reactor at Texas A\&amp;M University. The experiment operated with a primary detector mass of 72~g and achieved a baseline energy resolution of $\sim 40$~eV. Using exposures of 158~g-days (reactor-on) and 381~g-days (reactor-off), we performed a statistical background subtraction in the energy region of 0.25--3~keV. A GEANT4 simulation has been performed to understand the reactor-correlated background present in the data and it agrees with our observations. The resulting best-fit ratio of the observed CE$\nu$NS rate to the Standard Model prediction after rejecting the reactor induced background from the data with the help of simulation, is $\rho = 0.26\pm 1534.74~\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.05~\mathrm{(sys)}$ with a significance of $0.007 \pm 0.022~\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.001~\mathrm{(sys)}$. This low significance indicates a high background rate at low energies. To have enhanced sensitivity, the MINER collaboration plans to relocate the experiment to the 85~MW$_\text{th}$ High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). With improved shielding, increased detector mass, and higher antineutrino flux, the upgraded setup is projected to achieve a 3$\sigma$ CE$\nu$NS detection within 30~kg$\cdot$days of exposure.</description>

      <title>Light shift suppression in a CPT magnetometer using linear polarization and double frequency interrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a suppression of the light shift in a Coherent-Population-Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer by using linearly polarized light and a differential measurement between magnetic resonances. The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for subsequent analysis. To meet the demands for broader bandwidths and higher spectral resolution driven by emerging science goals, efficient FPGA-based implementations of the PFB are essential. This work presents current results from a fixed-point digital design methodology for deploying the PFB architecture on spacequalified FPGAs. The approach emphasizes efficient resource utilization and numerical precision while satisfying stringent performance constraints, enabling scalable, high-resolution spectral processing for future space observatories and remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Tilt-to-length noise subtraction with pointing jitters from closed-loop dynamics for TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based mission for gravitational wave detection, employing a constellation of three drag-free satellites in high Earth orbits to form a laser interferometric observatory. A critical technical challenge is mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites, movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\zeta$ and used for noise subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC) are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the TTL noise subtraction.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty minimization in electronic stopping cross-section measurements using the backscattering method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is critical for ion beam analysis and related applications. While transmission methods are well established, backscattering approaches remain less explored from a metrological perspective, often lacking a systematic treatment of uncertainties. In this work, we present a quantitative framework to optimize experimental geometry in backscattering-based stopping measurements, explicitly accounting for both statistical and systematic errors. Applying the method to helium ions in gold thin films, we identify angular conditions that balance precision and accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3\% over a wide energy range. The results, benchmarked against SRIM and ICRU-49, demonstrate that our approach improves the reliability of RBS-derived stopping data and strengthens their use for reference purposes and model validation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a 1820 channel multiplexer for transition-edge sensor bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalability of most transition-edge sensor arrays is limited by the multiplexing technology which combines their signals over a reduced number of wires and amplifiers. In this Letter, we present and demonstrate a multiplexer design optimized for transition-edge sensor bolometers with 1820 sensors per readout unit, a factor of two more than the previous state-of-the-art. The design is optimized for cosmic microwave background imaging applications, and it builds on previous microwave superconducting quantum interference device multiplexers by doubling the available readout bandwidth to the full 4-8 GHz octave. Evaluating the key performance metrics of yield, sensitivity, and crosstalk through laboratory testing, we find an end-to-end operable detector yield of 78%, a typical nearest-neighbor crosstalk amplitude of ~0.4%, and a median white noise level of 83 pA/rtHz due to the multiplexer, corresponding to an estimated contribution of 4% to the total system noise for a ground-based cosmic microwave background telescope. Additionally, we identify a possible path toward reducing resonator loss for future designs with reduced noise. We expect these developments to alleviate the system complexity, cryogenic requirements, and cost of future large arrays of low temperature detectors.</description>

      <title>Studies of simulation framework for N{\nu}DEx experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.
  In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.
  The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.
  To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.</description>

      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and Synchrotron Validation of $\mu$-XRF for Sulfur Mapping in CTMP Paper Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.</description>

      <title>Low frequency phase stabilization and phase tuning of an optical lattice with a variable period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a low frequency feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase. The developed phase stabilization algorithm can be extended to more complicated 2D latices, than just periodic lattice.</description>
