      <title>Creative and geometric times in physics, mathematics, logic, and philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distinction between two different concepts of time that play a role in physics: geometric time and creative time. The former is the time of deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created when a non-necessary event becomes determined in a fundamentally indeterministic physics. This allows us to give a naturalistic characterization of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the determined past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and multivalued tensed logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and B-theories in the philosophy of time.</description>

      <title>Swedish Beams -- The Story of Particle Accelerators in Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though many of the experiments leading to the standard model of particle physics were done at large accelerator laboratories in the US and at CERN[1] many exciting developments happened in smaller national facilities all over the world. In this report we highlight the history of accelerator facilities in Sweden which was home to the highest-energy cyclotron in Europe for some time in the early 1950s.

      <title>An indeterminacy-based ontology for quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or "interpretations" of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT). The ontology assumes that the world can be fundamentally indeterminate in the sense of being constituted by entities with indeterminate properties. The process via which determinate values arise and persist differs in different quantum theories. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the Many-Worlds Interpretation and single-world relationalist theories, Bohmian Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. Moreover, quantum states represent quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each quantum theory specifies a structure with specific features. I will argue that GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of benefits that current influential ontologies lack, namely, wavefunction realism and primitive ontology, without some of their costs. Furthermore, it allows for the formulation of quantum theories that are clearly compatible with relativistic causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Finally, I will show how GQT provides a new way to compare and evaluate different quantum theories.</description>
