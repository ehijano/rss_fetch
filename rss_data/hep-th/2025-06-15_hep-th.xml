      <title>The building blocks of asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of all possible induced representations arising from theories admitting a Poincar\'e symmetry has molded our very conception of particles in flat space. In this note, we argue that if one takes the same viewpoint on the asymptotic symmetry group instead of the global one, the familiar relativistic classification is enhanced to provide a new notion of excitations in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These excitations blur the line between the quantum description of a particle and a spacetime geometry, and will appear in any theory with the same symmetry. By interacting together, they produce both the geometry of and propagating particles in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Exploring Entanglement Entropy for a Particle on a Torus with constant Metric and constant $U(1)$-Gauge Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the entanglement entropy associated with a particle confined to a torus with constant metric and $\theta$-terms related to a constant external $U(1)$-gauge field. Through this investigation, we aim to elucidate the interplay between geometric properties, topological terms, and entanglement entropy. Remarkably, we find that the presence of non-vanishing entanglement entropy is closely tied to fixing the metric. This insight highlights the significant influence of quantum entanglement on our understanding of quantum dynamics in complex spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>Duality and Infinite Distance Limits in Asymmetric Freely Acting Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use freely acting asymmetric orbifolds of type IIB string theory to construct a class of theories in four dimensions with eight supercharges. Their low energy effective field theories resemble $STU$ models, but have different duality groups: the orbifold's free action reduce the duality groups to congruence subgroups of the modular group. The fundamental domain is consequently larger and contains new interesting points at infinite distance on the real axis bounding the upper half plane. We verify that the distance conjectures hold in the non-geometric compactification of string theory studied here. In particular, we find points at infinite distance in moduli space at which the theory decompactifies to a different orbifold construction.</description>

      <title>The Central Emission Vertex of two gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that there exists an $s$-channel sequence of classical corrections to the $H$ diagram computed long ago by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. At leading logarithmic accuracy, those corrections feature the gravity BFKL kernel as a crucial element, and may be computed through either rapidity renormalisation group equations or amplitudes built through $s$-channel unitarity cuts. In this paper, we evaluate six-graviton amplitudes in next-to-multi-Regge kinematics, and compute for the first time the Central Emission Vertex for the emission of two gravitons, which is relevant to evaluate the corrections to the gravity BFKL kernel, and thus to go beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Origin of the QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity can give rise to (pseudo)scalar fields, for instance due to torsion. In particular, axions of gravitational origin have been proposed as a minimal and compelling solution to the strong CP problem. In this work, we critically examine the feasibility of this approach. We demonstrate that models in which the scalar field couples to fermionic currents only through derivatives do not yield a satisfactory axion. Moreover, we identify the necessary conditions for generating a gravitational axion through quantum effects, highlighting Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity as a promising theoretical setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the gravitational force can be obtained by gauging the Lorentz group, which puts gravity on the same footing as the Standard Model fields. The resulting theory - Einstein-Cartan gravity - has several crucial advantages. I will overview the construction of the Weyl-invariant version of this theory and discuss its applications in particle physics and cosmology, in particular for inflation and the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Symbol Alphabets in QCD and Flag Cluster Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full 245-letter symbol alphabet for all planar massless two-loop six-point Feynman integrals was recently determined in arXiv:2412.19884 and arXiv:2501.01847. In a parallel mathematical development, it was shown in arXiv:2408.14956 that there is cluster algebra preserving embedding of the partial flag variety $Fl_{2,n-2;n}$, which describes the kinematics of $n$ massless particles, into the Grassmannian Gr$(n{-}2,2n{-}4)$. In this paper we connect these developments by showing that most of the rational symbol letters can be expressed in terms of flag cluster variables, and that all of the algebraic symbol letters arise from infinite mutation sequences.</description>

      <title>Special Functions and Geometries in Scattering Amplitudes: From Particle Physics to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the fields of scattering amplitudes and Feynman integrals, with an emphasis on the geometries and special functions that they involve, and is devoted to two distinct research directions. In the first half of the thesis, we explore elliptic Feynman integrals in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N = 4 SYM) theory. In particular, we study elliptic generalizations of ladder diagrams, identifying the first two families of Feynman integrals involving the same elliptic curve to all loop orders, which provide a great testing ground for developing mathematical tools that can facilitate the calculation of elliptic integrals. In this direction, we initiate the symbol bootstrap for elliptic Feynman integrals, for which we generalize the so-called Schubert analysis to predict elliptic symbol letters. As a proof of principle, we obtain for the first time the symbol of the two-loop twelve-point elliptic double-box integral, resulting in a compact, one-line formula. In the second half of the thesis, we pioneer a systematic investigation of the Feynman integral geometries that are relevant to the study of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of black-hole mergers within the post-Minkowskian expansion of classical gravity. Specifically, we classify the geometries and special functions appearing in the expansion up to four loops. Among other findings, we identify the first Calabi-Yau three-dimensional geometry relevant to gravitational-wave physics. Subsequently, we study the Feynman integral giving rise to this Calabi-Yau geometry in more detail, and solve it by bringing its differential equation into canonical form - a step that required developing a new method that accommodates for apparent singularities.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal holographic charge correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically compute the low-temperature charge correlators in near-extremal black holes with a planar horizon and an infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ extremal geometry, finding excellent agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.</description>

      <title>Impact of Buchdahl metric potential on thin-shell gravastar framework in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on gravitational vacuum stars (gravastars) with an isotropic matter distribution in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity incorporating Buchdahl metric function. Here we have conducted an analysis on thin-shell singularity-free gravastar configuration. The study demonstrates the viability of gravastars as alternatives to black holes (BHs) in this massive gravity. Our research yields singularity free analytical solutions for gravastar interior and without event horizon. Our discussion focuses on the properties of the thin shell of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid viz., length, energy, entropy and the massive gravity's impact on these physical properties. The junction conditions have been carefully examined and study of surface redshift analysis implies regularity of the model. Our investigation also includes energy condition analysis supporting the thin shell formation. Thus our solutions eliminate singularities and information paradoxes and the implications of these solutions are seemingly noteworthy and exhibit physical desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>A Gauge-Theoretic Action Principle for Viscous Incompressible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel action principle for two dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics that naturally incorporates both vorticity and viscous dissipation via gauge field couplings. The action features a Chern Simons like term, $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\rho$, capturing the topological structure of vorticity, alongside a quadratic term $(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} \partial_\nu A_\rho)^2$ representing viscous damping. Incompressibility is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier, while coupling to an external potential allows applications in geophysical flows. We derive the equations of motion, recovering the vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations and explicitly identifying the kinematic viscosity. This gauge theoretic framework leads to a Helmholtz type equation for vorticity linking topological and dissipative phenomena in viscous incompressible fluids. Analysis of Noether symmetries reveals conserved charges arising from gauge invariance and spatial translations, while viscosity explicitly breaks time reversal symmetry within this topological setting. Furthermore, the velocity vorticity gauge correspondence naturally suggests a Lindblad operator structure, providing a pathway toward a quantum description of viscous dissipation and allowing quantization of dissipative hydrodynamics. This framework also highlights how vorticity emerges as a natural Lindblad operator, capturing the transition from coherent rotational motion to thermal disorder as decoherence in the gauge field ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate a generalized uncertainty principle with both position and momentum operators modified from their canonical forms. We study whether Lorentz symmetry is violated and whether it can be saved with these modifications. The requirement that Lorentz invariance is not violated places restrictions on the way the position and momentum operators can be modified. We also investigate the connection between general uncertainty principle and non-commutative geometry models, e.g.,laying out the connection between area/area operators and angular momentum in both models.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches with long range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Extremal Magic States from Symmetric Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic, a key quantum resource beyond entanglement, remains poorly understood in terms of its structure and classification. In this paper, we demonstrate a striking connection between high-dimensional symmetric lattices and quantum magic states. By mapping vectors from the $E_8$, $BW_{16}$, and $E_6$ lattices into Hilbert space, we construct and classify stabiliser and maximal magic states for two-qubit, three-qubit and one-qutrit systems. In particular, this geometric approach allows us to construct, for the first time, closed-form expressions for the maximal magic states in the three-qubit and one-qutrit systems, and to conjecture their total counts. In the three-qubit case, we further classify the extremal magic states according to their entanglement structure. We also examine the distinctive behaviour of one-qutrit maximal magic states with respect to Clifford orbits. Our findings suggest that deep algebraic and geometric symmetries underlie the structure of extremal magic states.</description>

Abstract: Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented in arXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Heavy Quark Diffusion from (2+1)-flavor Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice determination of the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in (2+1)-flavor QCD with almost physical quark masses. The momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients are extracted for a wide temperature range, from $T=163$ MeV to $10$ GeV. The results are in agreement with previous works from the HotQCD collaboration, and show fast thermalization of the heavy quark inside the QGP. Near the chiral crossover temperature $T_c\simeq150$ MeV, our results are close to the AdS/CFT estimation computed at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>No dynamical CPT symmetry restoration in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CPT symmetry is at the heart of the Standard Model of particle physics and experimentally very well tested, but expected to be broken in some approaches to quantum gravity. It thus becomes pertinent to explore which of the two alternatives is realized: (i) CPT symmetry is emergent, so that it is restored in the low-energy theory, even if it is broken beyond the Planck scale, (ii) CPT symmetry cannot be emergent and must be fundamental, so that any approach to quantum gravity, in which CPT is broken, is ruled out. We explore this by calculating the Renormalization Group flow of CPT violating interactions under the impact of quantum fluctuations of the metric. We find that CPT symmetry cannot be emergent and conclude that quantum-gravity approaches must avoid the breaking of CPT symmetry. As a specific example, we discover that in asymptotically safe quantum gravity CPT symmetry remains intact, if it is imposed as a fundamental symmetry, but it is badly broken at low energies if a tiny amount of CPT violation is present in the transplanckian regime.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for group manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It resolves the ergodicity issues commonly encountered in Lefschetz thimble-based approaches at a low computational cost. In this article, as a first step toward applying WV-HMC to lattice QCD, we extend the algorithm to cases where the configuration space is a group manifold. The key idea is to formulate the algorithm using a phase-space integral over the tangent bundle of the worldvolume, which naturally carries a symplectic structure. The validity of this novel algorithm is demonstrated using the one-site model with a purely imaginary coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results for $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions in general scalar fermion theories are presented to three loops. Various constraints on the individual coefficients for each diagram following from supersymmetry are analysed. The results are used to discuss potential fixed points in the $\varepsilon$-expansion for scalar fermion theories, with arbitrary numbers of scalar fields, and where there are just two scalar couplings and one Yukawa coupling. For different examples the fixed points follow a similar pattern as the numbers of fermions is varied. For diagrams with subdivergences there are extensive consistency constraints arising from the existence of a perturbative $a$-function and these are analysed in detail. Further arbitrary scheme variations which preserve the form of $\beta$ functions and anomalous dimensions in terms of 1PI diagrams are also discussed. The existence of linear and quadratic scheme invariants is demonstrated and the consistency condition are shown to be expressible in terms of these invariants.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics of anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

Abstract: We propose a numerical method to estimate one-point functions and the free-energy density of conformal field theories at finite temperature by solving the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for the two-point functions of identical scalars. We apply the method for the critical O(N) model for N = 1,2,3 in 3 $\leq$ d $\leq$ 4. We find agreement with known results from Monte Carlo simulations and previous results for the 3d Ising model, and we provide new predictions for N = 2,3.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interior structure of a holographic multi-band superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. We discover a new kind of transition rule among Kasner universe near the black hole singularity which is distinct from the holographic single-band superconductor model. This transition rule is the first generalization of Kasner transition behavior to scenarios involving multiple free parameters, which is useful for uncovering the most general interior structures of hairy black holes. Moreover, we find that the Kasner exponents are sensitive to the details of order parameters in boundary system. These different near singularity structures we found show that the black hole interior plays crucial role in characterizing the boundary dual condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials with the old formulas for pair correlators with the IZ measure. An essential new feature of the correlators is that they are not symmetric in eigenvalues - and thus can not be expressed through Schur polynomials only. Instead, we demonstrate that an expression is possible in terms of Schur derivatives. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field, a quantum field framework for spin-1/2 fermions that exhibit a Wigner doublet -- a discrete quantum number arising from nontrivial representations of the extended Poincar\'{e} group. In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the issue of how the perturbative and global fermion anomaly of Type I string theory in ten dimensions is cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism using the RR fields. This will be done by realising the RR fields as boundary modes of an eleven-dimensional bulk theory described in terms of a quadratic refinement of the differential KO-theory pairing. We will then generalise this analysis to Sugimoto's $usp(32)$ string and Sagnotti's $u(32)$ string.
  We also discuss in a more general setting the procedures which need to be followed when we try to cancel fermion anomalies in terms of $p$-form fields based on differential K-theory classes. This we illustrate by performing an analysis of the mod-2 anomaly cancellation in nine dimensions arising from the $S^1$ compactification of the Type I theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. In turn, we explain the interplay between the algebraic structure of black hole spacetimes and their associated dualities. For large classes of black hole geometries, explicit constructions are presented. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), discussing how such dualities place stringent constraints on the thermal spectra of correlators. In particular, the dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs. A number of numerical results supporting our conclusions is also presented, including a demonstration of how the longitudinal spectrum of quasinormal modes determines the transverse spectrum, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Gauge algebra and diffeomorphisms in string field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the gauge algebra of closed string field theory with a focus on diffeomorphisms. This algebra contains off-shell information in two ways. The first way is geometric, through the choice of three-punctured sphere defining the three-string vertex. We establish that to leading order in derivatives the superstring algebra is universal: identical for any choice of vertex. For bosonic strings, however, some off-shell dependence remains for vertices that require symmetrization. Off-shell information also appears because field-dependent redefinition of the gauge parameters can alter the algebra. We analyze this dependence in the language of $L_\infty$ algebras, looking at the role of trivial gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Super Macdonald polynomials and BPS state counting on the blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Negative moment of inertia of large-$N_c$ gluons on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory in $1+1$ dimensions at finite temperature on a spatial ring that rotates uniformly in a plane. We show that the effect of rotation results only in a simple kinematic enhancement of the gauge coupling $g$, which becomes rescaled by a Lorentz factor corresponding to the tangential rotational velocity of the ring. Using well-established analytic results in Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit of an infinite number of colors, we demonstrate that the moment of inertia of the large-$N_c$ gluon plasma on the ring is negative. This counterintuitive conclusion is, however, in agreement with recent first-principle numerical simulations of hot $3+1$ dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that also reported a negative moment of inertia for gluon plasma in an experimentally relevant window of temperatures above the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, we argue that our picture provides a qualitative explanation for three other intriguing features observed in lattice simulations of vortical QCD: the emergence of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed phase, the inconsistency of its spatial structure with a standard picture dictated by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the enhancement of the critical deconfining temperature by rotation.</description>

      <title>Extra-Dimensional Axion Expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions arising as modes of higher-dimensional gauge fields are known to offer a compelling solution to the axion quality problem and to naturally arise in string theory. In this context, it is interesting to ask how we would interpret an experimental measurement of the axion decay constant $f$. I give several arguments for, as well as concrete examples in string theory of, the existence in such a model of an axion string with tension of order $2\pi S_\mathrm{inst} f^2$, where $S_\mathrm{inst}$ is the instanton action. Furthermore, in models of this type axion strings are typically fundamental objects (rather than solitons), whose tension is at or above the fundamental cutoff of the theory. As a result, I argue that for an extra-dimensional QCD axion, it is likely that the fundamental cutoff scale lies at most two orders of magnitude above $f$. In addition to these core arguments, this paper begins with a self-contained introduction to the physics of extra-dimensional axions and ends with some comments on axion physics in relation to chiral fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum state of a system to another using local measurement processes, what is the probability of success? This probability is bounded by quantifying entanglement in both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of local unitary invariants of multipartite states that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. These monotones are constructed from local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a finite-time geometric optimization framework to analyze thermal fluctuations and optimal processes in black holes. Our approach implement geodesics in thermodynamic space to define optimal pathways between equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Since thermodynamic metrics need not be positive-definite, the method ensures a positive thermodynamic length by incorporating simple scale factor into the metric. We show that the thermodynamic length and the scale factor are sensitive to phase transitions in entropy representation, addressing a key gap in Hessian thermodynamic geometry. Additionally, we link the scale factor to the sign of thermodynamic curvature, connecting it to the information geometry governing optimal processes. Our results indicate that optimal fluctuations can drive the evaporation of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, which may significantly differ from Hawking radiation. We also explore optimal accretion-driven processes supported by an external inflow of energy.</description>

      <title>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. The recent DESI data, which indicate that dark energy may be dynamical, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model.</description>

      <title>Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ detection at the DUNE far detector on the experiment's sensitivity to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation. We show that the strongest observable NSI effect in the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance probabilities arises from $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We have studied the hierarchy sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and octant sensitivity of DUNE from $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance channels in presence of NSI. We have also studied the detection sensitivity of NSI phases and the future constaints on NSI parameters from the tau neutrino appearance channels in DUNE. Additionally, we examine the role of $\nu_\tau$ detection in constraining the unitary nature of the PMNS matrix. These studies emphasize the importance of incorporating $\nu_\tau$ detection in long-baseline neutrino experiments such as DUNE.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, excitonic systems, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analysis of the region slightly outside the conformal window of a non-trivial infrared fixed point in a generic bottom-up holographic setup. We focus on models, which study the dynamics of a scalar field, dual to quark degrees of freedom, in a (nearly) AdS geometry. Such models realize the picture expected for vector-like near-conformal theories from Dyson-Schwinger analysis. The analysis covers a toy model, which allows for analytic solutions, and a more general setup as well, which encompass a complete model for the ultraviolet physics. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of a parametrically light scalar state in the spectrum, which can act as a candidate for the Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from breaking of the approximate conformal symmetry. We also present detailed results for the vacuum structure, correlators, and Ward identities in the near-conformal regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of matter fields in the de Sitter universe. The energy-momentum tensor of the matter field is assumed to admit a wide variety including dust, perfect fluids with equations of state, fluids with tangential and radial pressure, and with bulk and shear viscosity. Under different initial conditions imposed on the velocity and the density profiles, and by combining the results from exact analytical methods with those obtained from numerical techniques, we track the formation and evolution of spherical marginally trapped spheres as the matter suffers continual gravitational collapse. We show that the quasilocal formalism of trapped surfaces provides an ideal framework to study the evolution of horizons. More precisely, black hole and cosmological horizons may be viewed as the time development of marginally trapped surfaces.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>
