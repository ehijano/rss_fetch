      <title>Estimation of temperature and precipitation uncertainties using quantile neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events pose significant risks and are challenging to predict. Assessing climate hazards requires placing quantitative constraints on geophysical fields under observable but fluctuating conditions. We propose a framework for estimating uncertainties -- a ReLU-bias loss quantile neural network (RBLQNN) -- with two novel modifications to the loss function to enforce uniform quantile accuracy and reduce degenerate predicted probability distributions. We evaluate the RBLQNN against other probabilistic baselines on a suite of datasets: synthetic datasets, observed daily temperature maxima from 1,501 NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather stations, and altimetry-observed precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). On synthetic datasets, the RBLQNN accurately predicts conditional distributions where more restrictive methods like linear quantile regression (LQR) or mean-variance estimation (MVE) neural networks fail, mitigates shortcomings of some other quantile neural networks, and converges stably under a range of hyperparameters. When applied to daily temperature maxima, the RBLQNN reveals that temperature distributions are relatively well described by Gaussian statistics, though nonlinear dependencies on local sea level pressure and geopotential heights appear important. For precipitation statistics, the RBLQNN strongly outperforms both LQR and MVE baselines, demonstrating its capacity to capture highly nonlinear and non-Gaussian conditional distributions. The RBLQNN's performance across varied datasets demonstrates it is a flexible and general approach for constraining uncertainties in geophysical quantities with nonlinear or non-Gaussian conditional dependencies.</description>

      <title>Learning Accurate Storm-Scale Evolution from Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term prediction of clouds and precipitation is critical for severe weather warnings, aviation safety, and renewable energy operations. Forecasts at this timescale are provided by numerical weather models and extrapolation methods, both of which have limitations. Mesoscale numerical weather prediction models provide skillful forecasts at these scales but require significant modeling expertise and computational infrastructure, which limits their accessibility. Extrapolation-based methods are computationally lightweight but degrade rapidly beyond 1-2 hours. This presents an opportunity for data-driven forecasting directly from observations using geostationary satellites and ground-based radar, which provide high-frequency, high-resolution observations that capture mesoscale atmospheric evolution. We introduce Stormscope, a family of transformer-based generative diffusion models trained on high-resolution, multi-band geostationary satellite imagery and ground-based weather radar over the continental United States. Stormscope produces forecasts at a temporal resolution of 10 minutes and 6 kilometer spatial resolution, which are competitive with state-of-the-art mesoscale NWP models for lead times up to 6 hours. Its generative architecture enables large ensemble forecasts of explicit mesoscale dynamics for robust uncertainty quantification. Evaluated against extrapolation methods and operational mesoscale NWP models, Stormscope achieves leading performance on standard deterministic and probabilistic verification metrics across forecast horizons from 1 to 6 hours. As Stormscope relies on globally available satellite observations (and radar where available), it offers a pathway to extend skillful mesoscale forecasting to oceanic regions and countries without strong operational mesoscale modeling programs.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Methane Removal as a Third Climate Intervention: Termination Risks and Air Pollutant Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric Methane Removal (AMR) is a third class of climate intervention, along with Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM). We show that, unlike CDR, the avoided warming by AMR is not durable due to methane's short atmospheric lifetime, although its temperature rebound upon termination is less abrupt than that of SRM. AMR's unique impact on air quality (tropospheric ozone) can be further modulated by background pollutant levels.</description>

      <title>HealDA: Highlighting the importance of initial errors in end-to-end AI weather forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI weather models now rival leading numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems in medium-range skill. However, almost all still rely on NWP data assimilation (DA) to provide initial conditions, tying them to expensive infrastructure and limiting the practical speed and accuracy gains of ML. More recently, ML-based DA systems have been proposed, which are often trained and evaluated end-to-end with a forecast model, making it difficult to assess the quality of their analysis fields. We introduce HealDA, a global ML-based DA system that maps a short window of satellite and conventional observations directly to a 1{\deg} atmospheric state on the HEALPix grid, using a smaller sensor suite than operational NWP and no background forecast at runtime. We treat HealDA strictly as a DA module: its analyses are used to initialize off-the-shelf ML forecast models without any fine-tuning of either. For a variety of off-the-shelf ML forecast models, including FourCastNet3 (FCN3), Aurora, and FengWu, HealDA-initialized forecasts lose less than one day of effective lead time when scored against ERA5. HealDA-initialized FCN3 ensembles similarly trail those of the ECMWF IFS ENS system by &lt; 24 h. We find that forecast error growth in these models i unchanged from HealDA initialization, and the skill gap primarily arises from the larger initial error of the HealDA analysis. Spectral analysis reveals that this stems from overfitting to the large scales and upper-tropospheric fields. We also demonstrate that small changes in the verification setup can shift apparent skill by 12--24h, underscoring the need for consistent scoring. Taken together, these results clarify the current performance of ML-based DA systems and show that a relatively simple, background-free network can already provide initial conditions that are usable by state-of-the-art ML forecast models with only modest loss in medium-range skill.</description>

      <title>A Cloud Condensation Model on Insoluble Nuclei Validated with Radiosonde and Ceilometer Data: Implications for Dust based Rainfall Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces and validates a cloud condensation model on insoluble nuclei using a novel comparative analysis of simultaneous radiosonde and ceilometer data. A transformation of the radiosonde's temperature and relative humidity profiles into a simulated optical backscatter signal is implemented via the model, which includes a critical rate-limiting activation step. By comparing this simulated signal with the ceilometer's measured data, the model can determine the minimum effective size of dust particles required to act as cloud condensation nuclei. This approach has direct implications for improving the parameterization of cloud formation in local weather models, particularly for rainfall forecasting in dust-prone arid and semi-arid regions.</description>

      <title>A strictly geostrophic product of sea-surface velocities from the SWOT fast-sampling phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While geostrophy remains the simplest and most practical balance to extract velocity information from sea-surface height anomaly (SSHa), confusions remain within the oceanographic community to what extent this balance can be applied to altimetric observations with the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. Given the limited temporal resolution of SWOT, many studies have resorted to claiming that the spatially filtered SSHa fields correspond to the geostrophic component. This introduces the ambiguity of which spatial scale to choose. Here, we build upon the recent developments in internal tide (IT) corrections (Yadidya et al., 2025) and apply a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based method introduced by Lapo et al. (2025) to robustly extract the geostrophic component associated with sub-inertial frequencies from the SWOT one-day-repeat orbit; we distribute the global dataset as a public good. We provide the joint probability density function (PDF) of vorticity and strain, and spectra of SSHa at a few cross-over regions.</description>

      <title>Livestock, Methane and Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane emissions by livestock have a negligible effect on Earth's temperature. For example, killing all of the approximately 1.6 billion cattle on Earth in the year 2025, when this paper was written, would only reduce atmospheric methane concentrations enough to change the temperature by -0.04 C. Killing all 1.3 billion sheep would lead to a temperature change of -0.004 C. New Zealand's pledge to reduce methane emissions of their livestock by 14% to 24% from those in the year 2017 would change the temperature by -0.000005 to -0.000008 C, far too small to measure. These are maximum temperature savings where methane emissions from domestic livestock are not replaced by other sources (such as wild ruminants and termites) during the inevitable rewilding of managed grasslands and rangelands.</description>

      <title>Gravity Wave Interactions in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the breakup propensity of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL) interacting with gravity waves using large-eddy simulation with a uniform vertical grid of $5$ m and horizontal spacing of $30$ m. A radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) state is constructed to enforce stationarity in the STBL, and the gravity waves are introduced via a vertical momentum forcing mimicking a packet of plane waves. A nondimensionalization involving the inversion height and mean horizontal base wind as length and velocity scales is proposed to provide a framework to analyze the forcing parameter space. The magnitude of the scaled forcing amplitude ($\mathcal{A}$) is critical in understanding various STBL breakup conditions. Classification of breakup was based on the reduction of the liquid water path for each forced STBL case. We found that breakup did not occur for $\mathcal{A}&lt;1$ and observed modest reductions in cloud for $1&lt;\mathcal{A}&lt;2$, but the deck recovered to the stationary state slowly after the single-period forcing ceased. Fixing $\mathcal{A}\sim 2$ showed that forcings with longer duration and wider locality promote breakup. However, when the forcing is a linear combination of waves of two different periods, the percentage of cleared cloud dramatically increases, though recovery of RCE is still observed in some cases. $\mathcal{A}\geq2.5$ marks a critical threshold by which the STBL breaks up entirely and remains patchy. We further explore the connection between these bulk breakup results and the turbulent state by examining energy budgets and the anisotropy induced by the forcing.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dispersion from Wall-Mounted Cylinders at Large Reynolds Number: Plume Transitions and Regime Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive experimental investigation of scalar dispersion from the free end of wall-mounted cylindrical obstacles immersed in a large-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer. A key focus is the characterization of transition behavior between distinct dispersion regimes: elevated plumes (EP), ground-level plumes (GLP), and ground-level sources (GLS). Experiments systematically vary the primary and secondary aspect ratios ($AR_1, AR_2$) and the velocity ratio ($ r$) to explore their effects on the evolution of scalar plumes. Plume classification is governed by the non-dimensional parameter $\tilde{h}_s / \delta_{cz}$, which quantifies the progressive interaction between the plume and the ground. Here, $\tilde{h}_s$ denotes the effective source height and $\delta_{cz}$, the vertical plume half-width. Detailed concentration measurements demonstrate that the EP--GLP--GLS transitions substantially modify both vertical and lateral dispersion characteristics. The measurements reveal systematic departures from classical dispersion-coefficient scaling. To assess the capability of existing models under these conditions, the experimentally determined dispersion coefficients are used to evaluate the Gaussian Dispersion Model (GDM) and a Wall Similarity Model (WSM). The GDM captures general trends but deviates in specific regimes, whereas the WSM offers improved representation under GLS conditions. The resulting dataset, grounded in systematic laboratory measurements, establishes a critical benchmark for validating numerical simulations and informing the development of next-generation predictive models. Finally, leveraging these results, a concise data-informed predictive framework is introduced that captures the EP--GLP--GLS transitions and provides first-order estimates of ground-level concentration across geometric and momentum-ratio parameter space.</description>

      <title>N.E.O.N.-Bridge Geometry Determination: Turbulence Modeling of Individual N.E.O.N.-Bridge Segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The N.E.O.N.-Bridge is a capstone project being developed by students at TAMUCC, under the oversight of Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project requires the development of a hull geometry for an autonomous bridge segment optimized to support onboard electronics and camera systems while maintaining stability in a dynamic water environment. Traditional ribbon bridge systems typically do not experience intense hydrodynamic loading due to current transportation and assembly methods, whereas the N.E.O.N-Bridge must continuously withstand forces from dynamic flow patterns. The requirement for a hull geometry to have both hydrodynamic design and rigidity, as in current ribbon bridges, has posed unique challenges. The current hull designs were evaluated through turbulent water-flow simulations performed with ANSYS Discovery. Boundary conditions were determined based on the forward motion of the bridge segment, simulating inlet and outlet flows, and the resulting pressure distribution. A waterline-based geometric constraint derived from the camera system's elevation enabled the simulation to model flow characteristics in an operational scenario. Velocity fields, pressure contours, and turbulent flow patterns were analyzed to identify areas of high loading and hydrodynamic inefficiencies. The findings will provide essential performance metrics that could be used to make design adjustments to the overall hull geometry. The simulation results will support improvements in stability, structural rigidity, and overall effectiveness of the hull geometry, advancing the development of the N.E.O.N-Bridge segments.</description>

      <title>Melting dynamics and mixing layer growth near the ice-ocean interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice melting into saline water plays a fundamental role in the dynamics near the ice-ocean interface in polar oceans. The physics of ice melting involves a non-trivial interplay between thermodynamics at the interface, hydrodynamic transport in the bulk and the properties of the ambient ocean. The key control parameters are the density ratio $R_\rho$ proportional to the ambient ocean salinity and the Lewis number $Le = \kappa_T/\kappa_S$, which compares the thermal and salt diffusivities. Increasing the salinity is known to slow down melting, with the melt rate transitioning from subdiffusive to diffusive as $R_\rho$ increases. Here, we ssess the role of turbulence in this transition, using highly-resolved numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a slowly melting upper boundary. We analyse the non-stationary growth of the temperature and meltwater mixing layers, varying the Lewis number and the density ratio. While meltwater is continuously entrained by convection inside the bulk, we identify a transition from convection to diffusion close to the interface. This transition is reflected by the formation of an interfacial boundary layer that regulates the flux of meltwater pouring into the turbulent bulk for $R_\rho \gtrsim 10$. Using mixing-layer diagnostics based on meltwater-concentration thresholds, we observe that the turbulent layer grows super-diffusively $\propto t^{1.33}$, while the interfacial boundary layer expands diffusively $\propto t^{0.5}$ but with a non-universal prefactor. These results indicate that double-diffusive effects are here confined to the interface, and highlight potential limitations of diagnostics based on fixed concentration thresholds in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>CondensNet: Enabling stable long-term climate simulations via hybrid deep learning models with adaptive physical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient climate simulations are crucial for understanding Earth's evolving climate. However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud resolving models, that provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrisation schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud resolving models, also referred to as super paramtetrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super parameterization schemes.
  We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations.</description>

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Nowcast3D: Reliable precipitation nowcasting via gray-box learning</title>

Abstract: Reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation remains difficult because convective systems are strongly nonlinear, multiscale, and nonstationary in 3D. Radar is the backbone of nowcasting, yet existing methods struggle to predict extremes: physics-based extrapolation cannot capture growth and decay, deterministic learning tends to oversmooth and underestimate peaks, and purely generative models often lack physical consistency. Hybrid schemes help but are mostly limited to 2D composite reflectivity, collapsing the atmosphere into one layer and discarding vertical structure critical for height-dependent dynamics. We introduce Nowcast3D, a gray-box, fully 3D framework that works directly on volumetric radar reflectivity. The end-to-end model couples physically constrained neural operators (advection, local diffusion, and microphysics) with a conditional diffusion model to generate ensemble forecasts with quantified uncertainty. Trained on provincial-scale 3D volumes over a $10.24^\circ \times 10.24^\circ$ region and fine-tuned on a $2.56^\circ \times 2.56^\circ$ city region ($0.01^\circ \approx 1$ km), Nowcast3D provides near-real-time forecasts up to 3 h and outperforms competitive baselines in cross-region and temporal out-of-sample tests. It can also infer wind fields without labeled supervision, supporting physically plausible transport. In a nationwide blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists, Nowcast3D ranked first and was preferred in 57% of post-hoc assessments, surpassing the leading baseline (27%). These results highlight its reliability and operational value for extreme precipitation nowcasting.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>
