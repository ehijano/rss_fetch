      <title>On the cover time of Brownian motion on the Brownian continuum random tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon almost-every realisation of the Brownian continuum random tree (CRT), it is possible to define a canonical diffusion process or `Brownian motion'. The main result of this article establishes that the cover time of the Brownian motion on the Brownian CRT (i.e.\ the time taken by the process in question to visit the entire state space) is equal to the infimum over the times at which the associated local times are strictly positive everywhere. The proof of this result depends on the recursive self-similarity of the Brownian CRT and a novel version of the first Ray-Knight theorem for trees, which is of independent interest. As a consequence, we obtain that the suitably-rescaled cover times of simple random walks on critical, finite variance Galton-Watson trees converge in distribution with respect to their annealed laws to the cover time of Brownian motion on the Brownian CRT. Other families of graphs that have the Brownian CRT as a scaling limit are also covered. Additionally, we partially confirm a 1991 conjecture of David Aldous regarding related cover-and-return times.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity of $2K-B$ and a degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of $2K-B$, where $B$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion and $K$ is its concave majorant. In light of Pitman's $2M-B$ theorem, it was recently conjectured by Ouaki and Pitman \cite{OP} that $2K-B$ has the law of the BES(5) process. The two processes share properties such as Brownian scaling, time inversion and quadratic variation, and the same one point distribution and infinitesimal generator, among many other evidences; and it remains to prove that $2K-B$ is Markovian. However, we show that this conjecture is false. To better understand the similarity between these two processes, we study a degeneration of $2K-B$. We show it is a mixture of BES(3), and get other properties including multiple points distribution, infinitesimal generator, and path decomposition at future infimum. We also further investigate the Markovian structure and the filtrations of $2K-B, B$ and $K$.</description>

      <title>A Probability Inequality for Convolutions of MTP2-Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A probability inequality is proved for n-fold convolutions of a smooth cumulative distribution function on (0,infinity)x...x(0,infinity), which is multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2). This inequality is better than an inequality of the same type as the Gaussian correlation inequality for distribution functions. An important example are some multivariate chi-square distributions, derived from the diagonal of a Wishart matrix.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of a tensor of random and deterministic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider operator-valued polynomials in Gaussian Unitary Ensemble random matrices and we show that its $L^p$-norm can be upper bounded, up to an asymptotically small error, by the operator norm of the same polynomial evaluated in free semicircular variables as long as $p=o(N^{2/3})$. As a consequence, if the coefficients are $M$-dimensional matrices with $M=\exp(o(N^{2/3}))$, then the operator norm of this polynomial converges towards the one of its free counterpart. In particular this provides another proof of the Peterson-Thom conjecture thanks to the result of Ben Hayes.
  The approach that we take in this paper is based on an asymptotic expansion obtained by the same author in a previous paper combined with a new result of independent interest on the norm of the composition of the multiplication operator and a permutation operator acting on a tensor of $\mathcal{C}^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Annulus crossing formulae for critical planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact formulae for three basic annulus crossing events for the critical planar Bernoulli percolation in the continuum limit. The first is for the probability that there is an open path connecting the two boundaries of an annulus of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. The second is for the probability that there are both open and closed paths connecting the two annulus boundaries. These two results were predicted by Cardy based on non-rigorous Coulomb gas arguments. Our third result gives the probability that there are two disjoint open paths connecting the two boundaries. Its leading asymptotic as $r/R\to 0$ is captured by the so-called backbone exponent, a transcendental number recently determined by Nolin, Qian and two of the authors. This exponent is the unique real root to the equation $\frac{\sqrt{36 x +3}}{4} + \sin (\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{12 x +1}}{3} ) =0$, other than $-\frac{1}{12}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. Besides these three real roots, this equation has countably many complex roots. Our third result shows that these roots appear exactly as exponents of the subleading terms in the crossing formula. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Expanding the same crossing probability as $r/R\to 1$, we obtain a series with logarithmic corrections at every order, suggesting that the backbone exponent is related to a logarithmic boundary CFT. Our proofs are based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The key is to encode the annulus crossing probabilities by the random moduli of certain LQG surfaces with annular topology, whose law can be extracted from the dependence of the LQG annuli partition function on their boundary lengths.</description>

      <title>Construction of Hunt processes by the Lyapunov method and applications to generalized Mehler semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the problem of characterizing those generalized Mehler semigroups that do correspond to c\`adl\`ag Markov processes, which is highly non-trivial and has remained open for more than a decade. Our approach is to reconsider the {\it c\`adl\`ag problem} for generalized Mehler semigroups as a particular case of the much broader problem of constructing Hunt processes from a given Markov semigroup. Following this strategy, a consistent part of this work is devoted to prove that starting from a Markov semigroup on a general (possibly non-metrizable) state space, the existence of a suitable Lyapunov function with relatively compact sub/sup-sets in conjunction with a local Feller-type regularity of the resolvent are sufficient to ensure the existence of an associated c\`adl\`ag Markov process; if the topology is locally generated by potentials, then the process is in fact Hunt. Other results of fine potential theoretic nature are also pointed out, an important one being the fact that the Hunt property of a process is stable under the change of the topology, as long as it is locally generated by potentials. Then, we derive sufficient conditions for a large class of generalized Mehler semigroups in order to posses an associated Hunt process with values in the original space. To this end, we first construct explicit Lyapunov functions whose sub-level sets are relatively compact with respect to the (non-metrizable) weak topology, and then we use the above mentioned stability to deduce the Hunt property with respect to the stronger norm topology. We test these conditions on a stochastic heat equation on $L^2(D)$ whose drift is the Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, driven by a (non-diagonal) L\'evy noise whose characteristic exponent is not necessarily Sazonov continuous.</description>

      <title>Triple collisions on a comb graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the number of collisions of three independent simple random walks on a subgraph of the two-dimensional square lattice obtained by removing all horizontal edges with vertical coordinate not equal to 0 and then, for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, restricting the vertical segment of the graph located at horizontal coordinate $n$ to the interval $\{0,1,\dots,\log^{\alpha}(|n|\vee 1)\}$. Specifically, we show the following phase transition: when $\alpha\leq 1$, the three random walks collide infinitely many times almost-surely, whereas when $\alpha&gt;1$, they collide only finitely many times almost-surely. This is a variation of a result of Barlow, Peres and Sousi, who showed a similar phase transition for two random walks when the vertical segments are truncated at height $|n|^{\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-continuity method for mean-field diffusions: large deviations and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pathwise large deviation principle in the Wasserstein topology and a pathwise central limit theorem are proved for the empirical measure of a mean-field system of interacting diffusions. The coefficients are path-dependent. The framework allows for degenerate diffusion matrices, which may depend on the empirical measure, including mean-field kinetic processes. The main tool is an extension of Tanaka's pathwise construction to non-constant diffusion matrices. This can be seen as a mean-field analogous of Azencott's quasi-continuity method for the Freidlin-Wentzell theory. As a by-product, uniform-in-time-step fluctuation and large deviation estimates are proved for a discrete-time version of the meanfield system. Uniform-in-time-step convergence is also proved for the value function of some mean-field control problems with quadratic cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, at arbitrary positive temperature, every infinite-volume local limit point of the two-dimensional one-component plasma (2DOCP, also known as Coulomb or log-gas, or jellium) satisfies a system of Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle (DLR) equations - in particular, we explain how to rigorously make sense of those despite the long-range interaction. We also show number-rigidity and translation-invariance of the limiting processes. This extends results known for the infinite Ginibre ensemble. The proofs combine recent results on finite 2DOCP's and classical infinite-volume techniques.</description>

      <title>On {\em BASTA} for Discrete-Time Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of Bernoulli/Geometric arrivals see time-averages, {\em BASTA}, in discrete-time queues when using a variety of scheduling rules. It is well-known that {\em BASTA}/{\em ASTA} holds in the framework of a discrete-time process with an imbedded arrival process without regard to scheduling rules. However, when scheduling rules are invoked, it is not always clear whether arrivals see time averages as asserted by the general theory. We resolve this issue so that {\em BASTA}/{\em ASTA} holds regardless of the scheduling rule at play.</description>

      <title>Cutoff phenomenon for asymmetric zero range process with monotone rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing time of the asymmetric Zero Range process on the segment with a non-decreasing rate. We show that the cutoff holds in the totally asymmetric case with a convex flux, and also with a concave flux if the asymmetry is strong enough. We show that the mixing occurs when the macroscopic system reaches equilibrium. A key ingredient of the proof, of independent interest, is the hydrodynamic limit for irregular initial data.</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cournot's principle states that a typical event (i.e., an event with probability very close to $1$) occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  To make the logical structure of the principle clearer, in this paper a reformulation of the principle is proposed. This reformulation is based on the following three elements: (1) The explicit definition of the empirical property of practical certainty, (2) the clear separation between probability measure and experiment, including the remark that typicality is a mathematical property defined by the probability measure while practical certainty is an empirical property defined by the experiment, and (3) the explicit formulation of the product rule for independent trials.
  The novel formulation then states that a probability measure $P$ $\textit{governs}$ an experiment $E$ if the events that are typical according to $P^n$ are practically certain according to $E^n$ for all $n \geq 1$, where $P^n$ is the $n$-fold product of $P$ and $E^n$ is the experiment whose trials are composed of $n$ trials of $E$.
  The novel formulation highlights the possible existence of two ambiguities in the principle, namely: (i) that different probability measures govern the same experiment and (ii) that the same probability measure governs different experiments. In this paper the first ambiguity is rigorously disproved, while the second is disproved provided that a suitable property characterizing the empirical equivalence of experiments is assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization naturally appear in many application areas, including machine learning. Our goal is to go further in the analysis of the Stochastic Average Gradient Accelerated (SAGA) algorithm. To achieve this, we introduce a new  $\lambda$-SAGA algorithm which interpolates between the Stochastic Gradient Descent ($\lambda=0$) and the SAGA algorithm ($\lambda=1$). Firstly, we investigate the almost sure convergence of this new algorithm with decreasing step which allows us to avoid the restrictive strong convexity and Lipschitz gradient hypotheses associated to the objective function. Secondly, we establish a central limit theorem for the $\lambda$-SAGA algorithm. Finally, we provide the non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of the Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider dimer models on growing Aztec diamonds, which are certain domains in the square lattice, with edge weights of the form $\nu(\,\cdot\,)^\beta$, where $\nu(\,\cdot\,)$ is a doubly periodic function on the edges of the lattice and $\beta$ is an inverse temperature parameter.
  We prove that in the zero-temperature ($\beta\to\infty$) limit, and for generic values of $\nu(\,\cdot\,)$, these dimer models undergo crystallization: The limit shape converges to a piecewise linear function called the tropical limit shape, and the local fluctuations are governed by the Gibbs measures with the slope dictated by the tropical limit shape for high enough values of $\beta$.
  We also show that the tropical limit shape and the tropical arctic curve (consisting of ridges of the crystal) are described in terms of a tropical curve and a tropical action function on that curve, which are the tropical analogs of the spectral curve and the action function that describe the finite-temperature models. The tropical curve is explicit in terms of the edge weights, and the tropical action function is a solution of Kirchhoff's problem on the tropical curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of complex matrices were introduced by James in multivariate statistics. These special functions play many roles in random matrix theory. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a new use for them as holomorphic observables of the Circular Unitary Ensemble. We analyze the high-dimensional behavior of the expected derivatives of these random analytic functions, and show that they admit asymptotic expansions which can be described in terms of quasimodular forms, giving an apparently new connection between the CUE and number theory.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in any normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'{e} constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'{e} constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call long range expansion, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends polynomially on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, both degenerate versions and probabilistic extensions of many special numbers and polynomials have been explored. For instance, degenerate Bernstein polynomials and probabilistic Bernstein polynomials were investigated earlier. Assume that Y is a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. The aim of this paper is to study probabilistic degenerate Bernstein polynomials associated with Y which are both probabilistic extension of the degenerate Bernstein polynomials and degenerate version of the probabilistic Bernstein polynomials associated with $Y$. We derive several explicit expressions and certain related identities for those polynomials. In addition, we treat the special cases of the Poisson random variable, the Bernoulli random variable and of the binomial random variable.</description>

      <title>Distance Form Factor of a Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and a Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a distance form factor (DFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the DFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the DFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The DFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the DFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The DFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) for random variables or random vectors with different mathematical expectations easily reduces by means of shifts to SLLN for random variables or random vectors whose mathematical expectations are equal to zero. The situation changes for random sets, where shifts cannot reduce sets of more than one point to the set $\{0\}$. We study effects that appear because of this difference.</description>

      <title>Artificial Barriers for stochastic differential equations and for construction of Boundary-preserving schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the novel method of artificial barriers for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and use it to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes for strong approximations of scalar SDEs, possibly with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients, whose state-space is either bounded or half-bounded. The idea of artificial barriers is to augment the SDE with artificial barriers outside the state-space to not change the solution process, and then apply a boundary-preserving numerical scheme to the resulting reflected SDE (RSDE). This enables us to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes with the same strong convergence rate as the strong convergence rate of the numerical scheme for the corresponding RSDE. Based on the method of artificial barriers, we construct two boundary-preserving schemes that we call the Artificial Barrier Euler-Maruyama (ABEM) scheme and the Artificial Barrier Euler-Peano (ABEP) scheme. We provide numerical experiments for the ABEM scheme and the numerical results agree with the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Transition of $\alpha$-mixing in Random Iterations with Applications in Queuing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time series models incorporating exogenous regressors provide the foundation for numerous significant models across econometrics, queuing theory, machine learning, and various other disciplines. Despite their importance, the framework for the statistical analysis of such models is still incomplete. In contrast, multiple versions of the law of large numbers and the (functional) central limit theorem have been established for weakly dependent variables. We prove the transition of mixing properties of the exogenous regressor to the response through a coupling argument, leveraging these established results. Furthermore, we study Markov chains in random environments under a suitable form of drift and minorization condition when the environment process is non-stationary, merely having favorable mixing properties. Following a novel statistical estimation theory approach and using the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, we also establish the functional central limit theorem. Additionally, we apply our framework to single-server queuing models. Overall, these results open the door to the statistical analysis of a large class of random iterative models.</description>

Abstract: A convergence theorem for martingales with c\`adl\`ag trajectories (right continuous with left limits everywhere) is obtained in the sense of the weak dual topology on Hilbert space, under conditions that are much weaker than those required for any of the usual Skorohod topologies. Examples are provided to show that these conditions are also very easy to check and yield useful asymptotic results, especially when the limit is a mixture of stochastic processes with discontinuities.</description>

Abstract: Let us consider subcritical Bernoulli percolation on a connected, transitive, infinite and locally finite graph. In this paper, we propose a new (and short) proof of the exponential decay property for the volume of clusters. We do not rely on differential inequalities and rather use stochastic comparison techniques, which are inspired by several works including the paper "An approximate zero-one law" written by Russo in the early eighties.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ noise in semiconductors arising from the heterogeneous detrapping process of individual charge carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in semiconductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume that the trapping centers are homogeneously distributed in the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates. We show that uniform detrapping rate distribution emerges as a natural consequence of the vacant trap depths following the Boltzmann distribution, and the detrapping process obeying Arrhenius law. When these laws apply, and if the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter, $\alpha_{H}$, is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate. The proposed model implies that $1/f$ noise arises from the temporal charge carrier number fluctuations, not from the spatial mobility fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Regularity Structures B-series which are used for describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We define composition and substitutions of these B-series and as in the context of B-series for ordinary differential equations, these operations can be rewritten via products and Hopf algebras which have been used for building up renormalised models. These models provide a suitable topology for solving singular SPDEs. This new construction sheds a new light on these products and open interesting perspectives for the study of singular SPDEs in connection with B-series.</description>

      <title>Queues with service resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service time fluctuations heavily affect the performance of queueing systems, causing long waiting times and backlogs. Recently, it was shown that when service times are solely determined by the server, service resetting can mitigate the deleterious effects of service time fluctuations and drastically improve queue performance (Bonomo et al.,2022). Yet, in many queueing systems, service times have two independent sources: the intrinsic server slowdown ($S$) and the jobs' inherent size ($X$). In these, so-called $S\&amp;X$ queues (Gardner et al., 2017), service resetting results in a newly drawn server slowdown while the inherent job size remains unchanged. Remarkably, resetting can be useful even then. To show this, we develop a comprehensive theory of $S\&amp;X$ queues with service resetting. We consider cases where the total service time is either a product or a sum of the service slowdown and the jobs' inherent size. For both cases, we derive expressions for the total service time distribution and its mean under a generic service resetting policy. Two prevalent resetting policies are discussed in more detail. We first analyze the constant-rate (Poissonian) resetting policy and derive explicit conditions under which resetting reduces the mean service time and improves queue performance. Next, we consider the sharp (deterministic) resetting policy. While results hold regardless of the arrival process, we dedicate special attention to the $S\&amp;X$-M/G/1 queue with service resetting, and obtain the distribution of the number of jobs in the system and their sojourn time. Our analysis highlights situations where service resetting can be used as an effective tool to improve the performance of $S\&amp;X$ queueing systems. Several examples are given to illustrate our analytical results, which are corroborated using numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Given a discrete-time non-lattice supercritical branching random walk in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we investigate its first passage time to a shifted unit ball of a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon survival. We provide precise asymptotics up to $O(1)$ (tightness) for the first passage time as a function of $x$ as $x\to\infty$, thus resolving a conjecture in Blanchet-Cai-Mohanty-Zhang (2024). Our proof builds on the previous analysis of Blanchet-Cai-Mohanty-Zhang (2024) and employs a careful multi-scale analysis on the genealogy of particles within a distance of $\asymp \log x$ near extrema of a one-dimensional branching random walk, where the cluster structure plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Singular stochastic control problems motivated by the optimal sustainable exploitation of an ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the explicit solutions to singular stochastic control problems of the monotone follower type with (a) an expected discounted criterion, (b) an expected ergodic criterion and (c) a pathwise ergodic criterion. These problems have been motivated by the optimal sustainable exploitation of an ecosystem, such as a natural fishery. Under general assumptions on the diffusion coefficients, the discounting rate function, the running payoff function and the marginal profit of control action, we show that the optimal strategies are of a threshold type. We solve the three problems by first constructing suitable solutions to their associated HJB equations, which take the form of quasi-variational inequalities with gradient constraints. In the cases of the ergodic control problems, we also use a suitable new variational argument. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the solution of the discounted control problem to the one of the ergodic control problems as the discounting rate function tends to 0 in an Abelian sense.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>Polynomial invariants for rooted trees related to their random destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider three bivariate polynomial invariants $P$, $A$, and $S$ for rooted trees, as well as a trivariate polynomial invariant $M$. These invariants are motivated by random destruction processes such as the random cutting model or site percolation on rooted trees. We exhibit recursion formulas for the invariants and identities relating $P$, $S$, and $M$. The main result states that the invariants $P$ and $S$ are complete, that is they distinguish rooted trees (in fact, even rooted forests) up to isomorphism. The proof method relies on the obtained recursion formulas and on irreducibility of the polynomials in suitable unique factorization domains. For $A$, we provide counterexamples showing that it is not complete, although that question remains open for the trivariate invariant $M$.</description>

      <title>Signature Methods in Stochastic Portfolio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of stochastic portfolio theory we introduce a novel class of portfolios which we call linear path-functional portfolios. These are portfolios which are determined by certain transformations of linear functions of a collections of feature maps that are non-anticipative path functionals of an underlying semimartingale. As main example for such feature maps we consider the signature of the (ranked) market weights. We prove that these portfolios are universal in the sense that every continuous, possibly path-dependent, portfolio function of the market weights can be uniformly approximated by signature portfolios. We also show that signature portfolios can approximate the growth-optimal portfolio in several classes of non-Markovian market models arbitrarily well and illustrate numerically that the trained signature portfolios are remarkably close to the theoretical growth-optimal portfolios. Besides these universality features, the main numerical advantage lies in the fact that several optimization tasks like maximizing (expected) logarithmic wealth or mean-variance optimization within the class of linear path-functional portfolios reduce to a convex quadratic optimization problem, thus making it computationally highly tractable. We apply our method also to real market data based on several indices. Our results point towards out-performance on the considered out-of-sample data, also in the presence of transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Symmetric functions from the six-vertex model in half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic six-vertex model in half-space with generic integrable boundary weights, and define two families of multivariate rational symmetric functions. Using commutation relations between double-row operators, we prove a skew Cauchy identity of these functions. In a certain degeneration of the right-hand side of the Cauchy identity we obtain the partition function of the six-vertex model in a half-quadrant, and give a Pfaffian formula for this quantity. The Pfaffian is a direct generalization of a formula obtained by Kuperberg in his work on symmetry classes of alternating-sign matrices. One of our families of symmetric functions admits an integral (sum over residues) formula, and we use this to conjecture an orthogonality property of the dual family. We conclude by studying the reduction of our integral formula to transition probabilities of the (initially empty) asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-line.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of distributions which may be considered as a smoothed probabilistic version of the ultrametric property that famously characterizes the Gibbs distributions of various spin glass models. This class of \emph{high-entropy step} (HES) distributions is expressive enough to capture a distribution achieving near-optimal average energy on spin glass models in the so-called full Replica-Symmetry Breaking (fRSB) regime.
  Simultaneously, with high probability, there are polynomial-size certificates on the average energy achievable by \emph{any} HES distribution which are tight within a constant factor. These certificates can be found in polynomial time by a semidefinite program corresponding to a sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy we introduce, termed the HES SoS hierarchy. This improves over classical sum-of-squares certificates which are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$.</description>

      <title>Model free collision aggregation for the computation of escape distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

      <title>A note on faces of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The faces of a convex set owe their relevance to an interplay between convexity and topology that is systematically studied in the work of Rockafellar. Infinite-dimensional convex sets are excluded from this theory as their relative interiors may be empty. Shirokov and the present author answered this issue by proving that every point in a convex set lies in the relative algebraic interior of the face it generates. This theorem is proved here in a simpler way, connecting ideas scattered throughout the literature. This article summarizes and develops methods for faces and their relative algebraic interiors and applies them to spaces of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Just Wing It: Near-Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the stationary mass -- also called the unigram mass -- that is missing from a single trajectory of a discrete-time, ergodic Markov chain. This problem has several applications -- for example, estimating the stationary missing mass is critical for accurately smoothing probability estimates in sequence models. While the classical Good--Turing estimator from the 1950s has appealing properties for i.i.d. data, it is known to be biased in the Markovian setting, and other heuristic estimators do not come equipped with guarantees. Operating in the general setting in which the size of the state space may be much larger than the length $n$ of the trajectory, we develop a linear-runtime estimator called Windowed Good--Turing (WingIt) and show that its risk decays as $\widetilde{O}(\mathsf{T_{mix}}/n)$, where $\mathsf{T_{mix}}$ denotes the mixing time of the chain in total variation distance. Notably, this rate is independent of the size of the state space and minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in $n / \mathsf{T_{mix}}$. We also present an upper bound on the variance of the missing mass random variable, which may be of independent interest. We extend our estimator to approximate the stationary mass placed on elements occurring with small frequency in the trajectory. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our estimators both in simulations on canonical chains and on sequences constructed from natural language text.</description>

      <title>A deterministic proof of Loewner energy reversibility via local reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the orientation reversibility of chordal Loewner energy by reversing the orientation of a chord in partial increments. This fact was first proved by Yilin Wang (arXiv:1601.05297) using the reversibility of chordal Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) along with the interpretation of Loewner energy as the large deviation rate function of chordal SLE$_\kappa$ as $\kappa \to 0$. Our method is similar in spirit to Dapeng Zhan's proof (arXiv:0808.3649) of chordal SLE$_\kappa$ reversibility for $\kappa \in (0,4]$, though it is purely deterministic. As a key step in our proof, we establish that a minimimal energy chord among those passing through a fixed finite set of points is a piecewise hyperbolic geodesic.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>
