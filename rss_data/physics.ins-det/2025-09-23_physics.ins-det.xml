      <title>Data-driven optimization of pixelated CdZnTe spectrometers for uranium enrichment assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work [Vavrek et al. (2025)], we developed the performance optimization framework spectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable performance across many readout channels. The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly-performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate the pyGEM uranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a 30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the spectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra.</description>

      <title>Assessing the operating characteristics of an ion-milled phonon-mediated quantum parity detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \pm 0.8 \mu \mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray Ptychography with SOPHIE: Guide and Instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft X-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft X-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.</description>

      <title>Neutron irradiation damage on Silicon Photomultipliers and electrical annealing studies for the CBM RICH detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\times 10^9$ to $5\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\times 10^8$ to $1\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.</description>

      <title>Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Fundamental Properties of Neutrino from Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven performance optimization of gamma spectrometers with many channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>
