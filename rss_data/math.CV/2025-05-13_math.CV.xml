      <title>A Note On Generalized $L_p$ Inequalities for the polar derivative of a polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( P(z) \) be a polynomial of degree \( n \) and $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. The polar derivative of \( P(z) \) is denoted by \( D_\alpha P(z) \) and is defined as $D_\alpha P(z) = nP(z) + \alpha z P'(z).$
  The polar derivative \( D_\alpha P(z) \) is a polynomial of degree at most \( n - 1 \) and it generalizes the ordinary derivative \( P'(z) \). In this paper, we establish some \( L_p \) inequalities for the polar derivative of a polynomial with all its zeros located within a prescribed disk. Our results refine and generalize previously known findings.</description>

      <title>New Taylor and Laurent series of axially harmonic, Fueter regular and polyanalytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fueter-Sce mapping theorem stands as one of the most profound outcomes in complex and hypercomplex analysis, producing hypercomplex generalizations of holomorphic functions. In recent years, delving into the factorization of the second operator appearing in the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem has uncovered its potential to generate novel classes of functions and their respective functional calculi. The sets of functions obtained from this factorization and the associated functional calculi define the so-called {\em fine structures on the $S$-spectrum}. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the function theories for the fine structures of Dirac type in the quaternionic framework, presenting new series expansions for axially harmonic, Fueter regular, and axially polyanalytic functions. These series expansions are highly nontrivial. In fact, when considering the hypercomplex realm, specifically the quaternionic or the Clifford setting, extending the concept of complex power series expansion is not immediate, and different Taylor and Laurent expansions appear with different sets of convergence. Additionally, our objectives include establishing the representation formulas for these function spaces; such formulas encode the fundamental properties of the functions and have numerous consequences. Finally, in the last section of this paper, we explain the applications of the fine structures in operator theory.</description>

      <title>Versal deformation of transversely holomorphic flows on the boundary of strongly convex domains of $\mathbb C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give a versal deformation for any transversely holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}_0$ given by the intersection of the orbits of a holomorphic vector field $\xi$ defined on a neighborhood of a set $M$ biholomorphic to a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded strongly convex open domain $\Omega \subset\mathbb C^n$ ($n\geq2$) of smooth boundary, with its boundary $\partial M$. That is, any germ of deformation of $\mathcal{F}_0$ is also obtained by intersecting the orbits of a deformation of $\xi$ with the boundary of $M$.</description>

      <title>Root functions of a meromorphic matrix function and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a practical method for constructing canonical sets of root and pole cancellation functions for a matrix-valued function $Q(z)$ that is meromorphic on the extended complex plane $\bar{\mathbb{C}}:=\mathbb{C} \cup \left\{ \infty \right\}$. This method is applied to solve a nonlinear system of $n\in \mathbb{N}$ differential equations of order $l\in \mathbb{N}$ with $n $ unknown functions $u_{i}\left( t \right)$, where $i=1,\, \mathellipsis ,\,n $.
  In addition, for a function $Q\in \mathcal{N}_{\kappa}(\mathcal{H}) ,\, \kappa \in \mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace 0 \rbrace$, with a pole at infinity of order $m \in \mathbb{N}$, we establish the following factorization \[ Q(z)=(z-\beta)^{m}\tilde{Q}(z), \, z\in \mathcal{D}(Q), \] where $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ is a regular point of $Q$, and $\tilde{Q}\in \mathcal{N}_{\kappa'}(\mathcal{H})$ is holomotphic at $\infty$. Unlike the Krein-Langer representation of $Q$, which involves a linear relation $A$, the factorization utilizes a bounded operator $\tilde{A}$ in the Krein-Langer representation of $\tilde{Q}$. The operator $\tilde{A}$ and the relation $A$ have identical spectra, except at two points: $\beta$ and $\infty$. The main advantage of this approach is that both the operator $\tilde{A}$ and the entire representation can be constructed explicitly and in a practically applicable manner for certain meromorphic functions $Q\in \mathcal{N}_{\kappa}^{n \times n}$ on $\bar{\mathbb{C}}$. We illustrate all main results through examples.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem along fibers of extreme points of the momentum polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a complex reductive Lie group acting on a compact K\"ahler manifold X and assume that the action of a maximal compact subgroup K of G is Hamiltonian. For each extreme point of the convex hull of the momentum map image, there is an associated open dense subset of X, which is invariant under a parabolic subgroup Q of G. We prove a Q-equivariant product decomposition for the Q-action on this subset and discuss some applications of the result. We show a similar statement for real reductive subgroups of G for the restricted momentum map.</description>

      <title>Spaceability of special families of null sequences of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the space $H(\Omega)^{\mathbb N}$ of sequences of holomorphic functions on an open set $\Omega\subset {\mathbb C}$. If $H(\Omega)$ is endowed with its natural topology and $H(\Omega)^{\mathbb N}$ is endowed with the product topology, then it is proved the existence of two closed infinite dimensional vector subspaces of $H(\Omega)^{\mathbb N}$ such that all nonzero members of the first subspace are sequences tending to zero pointwisely but not compactly on $\Omega$ and all nonzero members of the second subspace are sequences tending to zero compactly but not uniformly on $\Omega$. This complements the results provided in a recent work by the same authors.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove a central limit theorem for the mass distribution of random holomorphic sections associated with a sequence of positive line bundles endowed with $\mathscr{C}^3$ Hermitian metrics over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In addition, we show that almost every sequence of such random holomorphic sections exhibits quantum ergodicity in the sense of Zelditch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our primary aim is to explore a sufficient condition for the class of meromorphically convex functions of order $\alpha$, where $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$. The investigation will focus on studying a class of continuous functions defined on $[0,1)$, and analyzing the properties of the Schwarzian norm of locally univalent meromorphic functions. Moreover, a new subclass of meromorphic functions is also introduced, and some of its characteristics are examined.</description>

      <title>The spectral constant for the quantum cross and asymptotically sharp bounds for annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum annulus of type $r$ is the class of invertible operators with singular values in $(1/r,r).$ Given an analytic function on the classical annulus of type $r,$ we may evaluate it on operators in the quantum annulus by The spectral constant gives the maximum ratio betweeen the supremum over the norm of evalutions at operators in the quantum annulus to the supremum over classical evaluations. We show that the limit of the spectral constant as $r$ goes to infinity is $2.$ Via the correspondence between annuli and hyperbolae, our study degenerates the problem to one on the quantum cross, pairs of contractions with product zero, where the spectral constant is exactly $2.$
  The essential technique is to rationally dilate $Z$ to $\hat{Z}$ which has $U =(\hat{Z}+(\hat{Z}^{-1})^*)/(r+1/r)$ unitary and estimate $Uf(\hat{Z})U^*$ directly.</description>

      <title>Positivity in the shadow of Hodge index theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking a compact K\"{a}hler manifold as playground, we explore the powerfulness of Hodge index theorem. A main object is the Lorentzian classes on a compact K\"{a}hler manifold, behind which the characterization via Lorentzian polynomials over the K\"{a}hler cone and hence the validity of Hodge index theorem. Along the exploration, we discover several applications in complex geometry that may be unexpected before. (1) For a Lefschetz type operator given by the complete intersection of nef classes, we give a complete characterization of its kernel face against the pseudo-effective cone. (2) We provide a new approach to Teissier's proportionality problem from the validity of hard Lefschetz property. This perspective enables us to establish the extremals for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality on a strictly Lorentzian class, and thus also characterize the most extremal case for a log-concavity sequence given by the intersection numbers of two nef classes. These Lorentzian classes include the fundamental classes of smooth projective varieties or compact K\"{a}hler manifolds as typical examples, hence our result extends Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson's and Fu-Xiao's results in respective settings to broader contexts, e.g. certain algebraic cycle classes given by reducible subvarieties. (3) Furthermore, we also strengthen the proportionality characterization by comparing various quantitative deficits and establishing stability estimates. Two quantitative sharper stability estimates with close relation with complex Monge--Amp\`{e}re equations and Newton-Okounkov bodies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl laws for exponentially small singular values of the $\overline{\partial}$ operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the number of exponentially small singular values of the semiclassical $\overline{\partial}$ operator on exponentially weighted $L^2$ spaces on the two-dimensional torus. Accurate upper and lower bounds on the number of such singular values are established with the help of auxiliary notions of upper and lower bound weights. Assuming that the Laplacian of the exponential weight changes sign along a curve, we construct optimal such weights by solving a free boundary problem, which yields a Weyl asymptotics for the counting function of the singular values in an interval of the form $[0,\mathrm{e}^{-\tau/h}]$, for $\tau&gt;0$ smaller than the oscillation of the weight. We also provide a precise description of the leading term in the Weyl asymptotics, in the regime of small $\tau &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>o-minimal geometry of higher Albanese manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. We study its higher Albanese manifolds, introduced by Hain and Zucker, from the point of view of o-minimal geometry. We show that for each $s$ the higher Albanese manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ can be functorially endowed with a structure of an $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable complex manifold in such a way that the natural projections $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{s-1}(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable and the higher Albanese maps $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{an}, \operatorname{exp}}$-definable. Suppose that for some $s \ge 3$ the definable manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is definably biholomorphic to a quasi-projective variety. We show that in this case the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step, i.e. the maps $\operatorname{Alb}^r (X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{r-1}(X)$ are isomorphisms for $r\ge 3$. It follows that if $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is dominant for some $s \ge 3$, then the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step and the pro-unipotent completion of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most 2-step nilpotent. This confirms a special case of a conjecture by Campana on nilpotent fundamental groups of algebraic varieties. As another application, we prove the existence and quasi-projectivity of unipotent Shafarevich reductions.</description>

      <title>On some inequalities for the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $\beta \ge 0,$ we consider the question whether $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|$ and $E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ are comparable on the whole complex plane. We show that the inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\le E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ holds globally if and only if $E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x)$ is completely monotone on $(0,\infty)$. For $\alpha\in [1,2)$ we prove that the complete monotonicity of $1/E_{\alpha,\beta}(x)$ on $(0,\infty)$ is necessary for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also sufficient for $\alpha =1.$ For $\alpha \ge 2$ we show that the absence of non-real zeros for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ is sufficient for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also necessary for $\alpha =2.$ All these results have an explicit description in terms of the values of the parameters $\alpha,\beta.$ Along the way, several inequalities for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ on the half-plane $\{\Re z \ge 0\}$ are established, and a characterization of its log-convexity and log-concavity on the positive half-line is obtained.</description>

      <title>Operators associated with the pentablock and their relations with biball and symmetrized bidisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commuting triple of Hilbert space operators $(A,S,P)$ is said to be a \textit{$\mathbb{P}$-contraction} if the closed pentablock $\overline{\mathbb P}$ is a spectral set for $(A,S,P)$, where
  \[
  \mathbb{P}:=\left\{(a_{21}, \mbox{tr}(A_0), \mbox{det}(A_0))\ : \ A_0=[a_{ij}]_{2 \times 2} \; \; \&amp; \;\; \|A_0\| &lt;1 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^3.
  \]
  A commuting triple of normal operators $(A, S, P)$ acting on a Hilbert space is said to be a \textit{$\mathbb P$-unitary} if the Taylor-joint spectrum $\sigma_T(A, S, P)$ of $(A, S, P)$ is contained in the distinguished boundary $b\mathbb{P}$ of $\PC$. Also, $(A, S , P)$ is called a \textit{$\mathbb P$-isometry} if it is the restriction of a $\mathbb P$-unitary $(\hat A, \hat S, \hat P)$ to a joint invariant subspace of $\hat A, \hat S, \hat P$. We find several characterizations for the $\mathbb P$-unitaries and $\mathbb P$-isometries. We show that every $\mathbb P$-isometry admits a Wold type decomposition that splits it into a direct sum of a $\mathbb P$-unitary and a pure $\mathbb P$-isometry. Moving one step ahead we show that every $\mathbb P$-contraction $(A,S,P)$ possesses a canonical decomposition that orthogonally decomposes $(A,S,P)$ into a $\mathbb P$-unitary and a completely non-unitary $\mathbb P$-contraction. We find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a $\mathbb P$-contraction $(A, S, P)$ dilates to a $\mathbb P$-isometry $(X, T, V)$ with $V$ being the minimal isometric dilation of $P$. Then we show an explicit construction of such a conditional dilation. We show interplay between operator theory on the following three domains: the pentablock, the biball and the symmetrized bidisc.</description>

Abstract: Famous results due to von Neumann, Sz.-Nagy and Arveson assert that the following four statements are equivalent; a Hilbert space operator $T$ is a contraction; the closed unit disk $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a spectral set for $T$; $T$ can be dilated to a Hilbert space isometry; $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a complete spectral set for $T$. In this article, we show by counter examples that no two of them are equivalent for Banach space operators. If $\mathcal F_r$ is the family of all Banach space operators having norm less than or equal to $r$ and if $D_R$ denotes the open disk in the complex plane with centre at the origin and radius $R$, then we prove by an application of Bohr's theorem that $\overline{D}_R$ is the minimal spectral set for $\mathcal F_r$ if and only if $r=\frac{R}{3}$. Also, we prove the equivalence of the following two facts: the Bohr radius of $D_R$ is $\frac{R}{3}$ and $\sup \{ r&gt;0\,:\, \overline{D}_R \text{ is a spectral set for } \mathcal F_r \}=\frac{R}{3}$. We found several new characterizations for a Hilbert space in terms of spectral set and complete spectral set for different operators.</description>
