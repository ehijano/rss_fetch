      <title>Reduction of the group isomorphism problem to the group automorphism problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the graph isomorphism problem is polynomial-time reducible to the graph automorphism problem (in fact these two problems are polynomial-time equivalent). We show that, analogously, the group isomorphism problem is polynomial-time reducible to the group automorphism problem. Reductions to other relevant problems like automorphism counting are also given.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and Selfish Behavior in Network Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider non-atomic games in populations that are provided with a choice of preventive policies to act against a contagion spreading amongst interacting populations, be it biological organisms or connected computing devices. The spreading model of the contagion is the standard SIR model. Each participant of the population has a choice from amongst a set of precautionary policies with each policy presenting a payoff or utility, which we assume is the same within each group, the risk being the possibility of infection. The policy groups interact with each other. We also define a network model to model interactions between different population sets. The population sets reside at nodes of the network and follow policies available at that node. We define game-theoretic models and study the inefficiency of allowing for individual decision making, as opposed to centralized control. We study the computational aspects as well.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. We say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $\alpha$-local spectral expander for some $\alpha\leq \pi/2-1$. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for Ramanujan path complexes such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishen, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>ActionReasoningBench: Reasoning about Actions with and without Ramification Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning about Actions and Change (RAC) has historically played a pivotal role in solving foundational AI problems, such as the frame problem. It has driven advancements in AI fields, such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. RAC remains crucial for AI systems that operate in dynamic environments, engage in interactive scenarios, or rely on commonsense reasoning. Despite substantial advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various AI domains, their performance in RAC remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark, ActionReasoningBench, which encompasses 8 domains and includes questions for up to 19 action sequences. This benchmark rigorously evaluates LLMs across six key RAC dimensions: Fluent Tracking, State Tracking, Action Executability, Effects of Actions, Numerical RAC, and Composite Questions. LLMs demonstrate average accuracy rates of 73.55%, 65.63%, 58.73%, and 62.38% on the former four dimensions, which are frequently discussed in RAC literature. However, the performance on the latter two dimensions, which introduce complex and novel reasoning questions, the average performance of LLMs is lowered to 33.16% and 51.19%, respectively, reflecting a 17.9% performance decline. We also introduce new ramification constraints to capture the indirect effects of actions, providing deeper insights into RAC challenges. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and commercial models, reveals challenges across all RAC dimensions, particularly in handling ramifications, with GPT-4o failing to solve any question and o1-preview achieving a score of only 18.4%.</description>

      <title>Optimizing for aggressive-style strategies in Flesh and Blood is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flesh and Blood (FAB) is a trading card game that two players need to make a strategy to reduce the life points of their opponent to zero. The mechanics of the game present complex decision-making scenarios of resource management. Due the similarity of other card games, the strategy of the game have scenarios that can turn an NP-problem. This paper presents a model of an aggressive, single-turn strategy as a combinatorial optimization problem, termed the FAB problem. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate its equivalence to a 0-1 Knapsack problem, establishing the FAB problem as NP-hard. Additionally, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed to tackle real-world instances of the problem. By establishing the computational hardness of optimizing even relatively simple strategies, our work highlights the combinatorial complexity of the game.</description>

      <title>Limits of Deep Learning: Sequence Modeling through the Lens of Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their successes, deep learning models struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning and function composition. We present a theoretical and empirical investigation into the limitations of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers in such tasks. We prove that one-layer SSMs cannot efficiently perform function composition over large domains without impractically large state sizes, and even with Chain-of-Thought prompting, they require a number of steps that scale unfavorably with the complexity of the function composition. Also, the language of a finite-precision SSM is within the class of regular languages. Our experiments corroborate these theoretical findings. Evaluating models on tasks including various function composition settings, multi-digit multiplication, dynamic programming, and Einstein's puzzle, we find significant performance degradation even with advanced prompting techniques. Models often resort to shortcuts, leading to compounding errors. These findings highlight fundamental barriers within current deep learning architectures rooted in their computational capacities. We underscore the need for innovative solutions to transcend these constraints and achieve reliable multi-step reasoning and compositional task-solving, which is critical for advancing toward general artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Classification and degenerations of small minimal border rank tensors via modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained classification of $1_*$-generic minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ for $m \leq 5$. Together with previous results, this gives a classification of all minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ for $m \leq 5$: there are $107$ isomorphism classes (only $37$ up to permuting factors). We fully describe possible degenerations among the tensors. We prove that there are no $1$-degenerate minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m $ for $m \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Distinguishability of Product Distributions through Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of samples $x_1, \dots , x_k$ promised to be drawn from one of two distributions $X_0, X_1$, a well-studied problem in statistics is to decide $\textit{which}$ distribution the samples are from. Information theoretically, the maximum advantage in distinguishing the two distributions given $k$ samples is captured by the total variation distance between $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$. However, when we restrict our attention to $\textit{efficient distinguishers}$ (i.e., small circuits) of these two distributions, exactly characterizing the ability to distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ is more involved and less understood.
  In this work, we give a general way to reduce bounds on the computational indistinguishability of $X_0$ and $X_1$ to bounds on the $\textit{information-theoretic}$ indistinguishability of some specific, related variables $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$. As a consequence, we prove a new, tight characterization of the number of samples $k$ needed to efficiently distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ with constant advantage as
  \[
  k = \Theta\left(d_H^{-2}\left(\widetilde{X}_0, \widetilde{X}_1\right)\right),
  \] which is the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance $d_H$ between two distributions $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$ that are computationally indistinguishable from $X_0$ and $X_1$. Likewise, our framework can be used to re-derive a result of Halevi and Rabin (TCC 2008) and Geier (TCC 2022), proving nearly-tight bounds on how computational indistinguishability scales with the number of samples for arbitrary product distributions.</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and Zarankiewicz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices plays an important role in communication complexity and discrepancy theory. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of this norm, and provide new applications, involving Zarankiewicz type problems. We show that if $M$ is an $m\times n$ Boolean matrix such that $\gamma_2(M)&lt;\gamma$ and $M$ contains no $t\times t$ all-ones submatrix, then $M$ contains $O_{\gamma,t}(m+n)$ one entries. In other words, graphs of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm are degree bounded. This addresses a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami for locally sparse matrices. We prove that if $G$ is a $K_{t,t}$-free incidence graph of $n$ points and $n$ homothets of a polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the average degree of $G$ is $O_{d,P}(t(\log n)^{O(d)})$. This is sharp up the $O(.)$ notations. In particular, we prove a more general result on semilinear graphs, which greatly strengthens the work of Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran.</description>
