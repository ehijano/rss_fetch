      <title>Special curves and Hamiltonian systems from polynomial eigenfunctions of an elliptic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of polynomials linked to the set of the deltoid tangents and its associated algebraic hypersurfaces has been presented in recent years. In this paper we study some related maximising and free plane curves. We also analyse the bifurcations on polynomial Hamiltonian dynamical systems defined from such a family.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) that motivates this comment provides, in particular, one answer to the following natural question: what is noncommutative geometry on a lattice? In the context of spectral triples, Marcolli and van Suijlekom define in op. cit. a Dirac operator on the lattice and identify the corresponding Spectral Action with the lattice Yang-Mills--Higgs system. In this comment we show that the continuum limit of this theory is the Yang-Mills action functional, without a Higgs scalar.
  R\'esum\'e: Qu'est-ce que la g\'eom\'etrie non-commutative sur r\'eseau ? \`A cette question l'article ici comment\'e (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) apporte une des r\'eponses possibles. Marcolli et van Suijlekom, travaillant dans le contexte des triplets spectraux, y construisent un op\'erateur de type Dirac pour le r\'eseau et d\'erivent une th\'eorie sur r\'eseau de type Yang-Mills--Higgs \`a partir de l'Action Spectrale. Ce commentaire montre que la limite continue de ce mod\`ele est la th\'eorie pure de Yang-Mills (sans aucun Higgs).</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Interfaces of discrete systems - spectral and index properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to study mixtures of different physical systems brought together on a discrete interface. Adapting work by M\u{a}ntoiu et al., we use an operator algebraic framework such that the bulk systems at infinity of the mixture are recovered via the spatial asymptotics of the operators on the interface. Fixing an asymptotics and interface algebra, we show how the essential spectrum and topological properties can be inferred from the bulk systems at infinity. By working with Hilbert $C^*$-modules, we can further refine these results with respect to an ambient algebra of observables.</description>

      <title>Retracts of degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation studied in the past years were non-degenerate multipermutation solutions. For degenerate solutions, a correct definition of multipermutation solutions has not been established so far. We fill here this gap providing a definition of multipermutation solutions that generalizes the one for non-degenerate solutions and we find an axiomatic description of this class by a set of equations that generalizes the equations describing non-degenerate multipermutation solutions.
  It turned out that the results do not need all the properties of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and therefore we prove them in a general universal-algebraic setting.</description>

      <title>WKB structure in a scalar model of flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define flat bands in the sense of Floquet--Bloch theory. One puzzling question originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also explains the quantisation condition -- both the WKB structure and that rule are confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.</description>

      <title>Quasi one dimensional anomalous (rogue) waves in multidimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations 1: fission and fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability (NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and hyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of propagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the behavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order, and described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of NLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of basic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by fission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process of fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are critical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking, and with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$ dimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane, fission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$ axis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D analogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical experiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of "AW growth + fission" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of the modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests their observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Geometry of effective field theory positivity cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positivity bounds are theoretical constraints on the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory. These bounds emerge from the requirement that a given effective field theory must be the low-energy limit of a relativistic quantum theory that satisfies the fundamental principles of unitarity, locality, and causality. The task of deriving these bounds can be reformulated as the geometric problem of finding the extremal representation of a closed convex cone~$\mathcal C_W$. More precisely, in the presence of multiple particle flavors, the forward-limit positivity cone $\mathcal C_W$ consists of all positive semi-definite tensors in $W =\left\{ S \in \mathrm{Sym}^2 (\mathrm{Sym}^2\, V^*)\oplus \mathrm{Sym}^2 \left({\Lambda}^2 V^*\right) : \tau S = S \right\}
  \subset \mathrm{Sym}^2(V^*\otimes V^*)$, where $\tau$ denotes transposition in the second and fourth tensor factor and $V\cong\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of flavors. In this work, we solve this question up to three flavors, i.e.~$n=3$, proving a full classification of all extremal elements in these cases. We furthermore study the implications of our findings, deriving the full positivity bounds for amplitudes with and without additional symmetries. In the cases with additional symmetries that we consider, we find that the so-called elastic bounds are sufficient to give rise to the full positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>A unified multi-perspective quadratic manifold for mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier in multiphysics damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiphysics damage problems, material degradation is often modeled using local or global damage variables, whose evolution introduces strong nonlinearities and significant computational costs. Linear projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used to accelerate these simulations but often fail to capture complex nonlinear damage evolution effectively. This limitation arises from the slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width, which leads to a phenomenon known as the Kolmogorov barrier in linear approximation. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a novel unified multi-perspective (multi-field and multi-state) quadratic manifold-based ROM framework for thermo-mechanically coupled damage-plasticity problems. A key feature lies in a multi-field and multi-state decomposition strategy that is grounded in the material's physical response to guide the selection of mode numbers for each coupled field. Moreover, the framework decouples both material states and physical fields, providing clearer insights into the contributions and interactions of each field within the overall multiphysics simulation. Benchmark tests demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates the Kolmogorov barrier of linear projection-based ROMs by ensuring a smooth and monotonic decrease in error as the number of modes increases. The proposed multi-perspective quadratic manifold framework offers a robust and flexible approach for efficiently reducing complex damage-involved multiphysics problems and shows strong potential for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On regularizations of the integral representation of Dirac delta function -- elementary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents, in an elementary way, but with mathematical precision and without harm to the intuition, the path from the integral representation to the Dirac delta, starting with Schwartz's functional approach. Next, the considered representation is presented in a more intuitive sequential approach, formulated by Mikusi\'nski and Sikorski. Finally, we present the third regularization that can be related to Sato's approach to distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Lindblad equation governs the non-unitary time evolution of density operators used in the description of open quantum systems. It is usually derived from the von Neumann equation for a large system, at given physical conditions, when a small subsystem is explicitly singled out and the rest of the system acts as an environment whose degrees of freedom are traced out. In the specific case of a subsystem with variable particle number, the equilibrium density operator is given by the well-known grand canonical Gibbs state. Consequently, solving the Lindblad equation in this case should automatically yield, without any additional assumptions, the corresponding density operator in the limiting case of statistical equilibrium. Current studies of the Lindblad equation with varying particle number assume, however, the grand canonical Gibbs state a priori: the chemical potential is externally imposed rather than derived from first principles, and hence the corresponding density operator is not obtained as a natural solution of the equation. In this work, we investigate the compatibility of grand canonical statistical mechanics with the derivation of the Lindblad equation. We propose an alternative and complementary approach to the current literature that consists in using a generalized system Hamiltonian which includes a term $\mu N$. In a previous paper, this empirically well-known term has been formally derived from the von Neumann equation for the specific case of equilibrium. Including $\mu N$ in the system Hamiltonian leads to a modified Lindblad equation which yields the grand canonical state as a natural solution, meaning that all the quantities involved are obtained from the physics of the system without any external assumptions.</description>

      <title>Exponentiation and decomposition formulas for common operators 1: Classical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, exponentiation and factorization (decomposition) formulas are derived and discussed for common matrix operators that arise in studies of classical dynamics, linear and nonlinear optics, and special relativity. To understand the physical properties of systems of common interest, one first needs to understand the mathematical properties of the symplectic group Sp(2), the special unitary groups SU(2) and SU(1,1), and the special orthogonal groups SO(3) and SO(1,2). For these groups, every matrix can be written as the exponential of a generating matrix, which is a linear combination of three fundamental matrices (generators). For Sp(2), SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), every matrix also has a Schmidt decomposition, in which it is written as the product of three simpler matrices. The relations between the entries of the matrix, the generator coefficients and, where appropriate, the Schmidt-decomposition parameters are described in detail. It is shown that Sp(2) is isomorphic to (has the same structure as) SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), and SU(2) is isomorphic to SO(3). Several examples of these isomorphisms (relations between Schmidt decompositions and product rules) are described, which illustrate their usefulness (complicated results can be anticipated or derived easily). This tutorial is written at a level that is suitable for senior undergraduate students and junior graduate students.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Theorem and Fundamental Transfer Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states in relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical setup for investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states is presented for a scalar massive Quantum Field Theory ($1+1$)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. These states are constructed using smeared Weyl operators compactly supported in two diamond regions belonging to the right Rindler wedge. Using this setup, we verified the known properties of the relative entropy, namely: positivity, increase with the size of the spacetime regions considered, decrease with the increase of the mass parameter, a linear increase with respect to the spatial distance between the two diamond regions is also observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize the eigenvalues (flat bands) of the maximal abelian cover of a finite multi-graph in terms of the combinatorics of the base graph. This solves a problem of Higuchi and Nomura (2009, Problem 6.11). We use our new criterion to prove that the maximal abelian cover of any regular multi-graph has no eigenvalues, thereby proving a conjecture of (ibid., Conjecture 6.12). In an appendix, we relate our criterion for eigenvalues of the maximal abelian cover to an existing criterion for eigenvalues of the universal cover.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the discrete Gaussian free field with degenerate random conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete Gaussian free fields with ergodic random conductances on a class of random subgraphs of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d \geq 2$, including i.i.d.\ supercritical percolation clusters, where the conductances are possibly unbounded but satisfy a moment condition. As our main result, we show that, for almost every realization of the environment, the rescaled field converges in law towards a continuum Gaussian free field. We also present a scaling limit for the covariances of the field. To obtain the latter, we establish a quenched local limit theorem for the Green's function of the associated random walk among random conductances with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact infrared scaling behavior of Randers-Finsler scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling behavior of Randers-Finsler massless scalar field theories in the infrared regime. For that, we compute analytically the radiative corrections to the corresponding anomalous dimensions, related to the critical exponents of the theory, first up to next-to-leading loop order and later for all-loop levels. We consider the effect of the Randers-Finsler space-time properties on the critical exponents by considering the parameter characterizing those space-times in its exact form. We employ field-theoretic renormalization group and $\epsilon$-expansion techniques at dimensions $d = 4 - \epsilon$ through three distinct and independent methods. At the end, we furnish the physical interpretation of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>A vectorial Darboux transformation for integrable matrix versions of the Fokas-Lenells equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using bidifferential calculus, we derive a vectorial binary Darboux transformation for an integrable matrix version of the first negative flow of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy. A reduction from the latter system to an integrable matrix version of the Fokas-Lenells equation is then shown to inherit a corresponding vectorial Darboux transformation. Matrix soliton solutions are derived from the trivial seed solution. Furthermore, the Darboux transformation is exploited to determine in a systematic way exact solutions of the two-component vector Fokas-Lenells equation on a plane wave background. This includes breathers, dark solitons, rogue waves and "beating solitons".</description>

      <title>Edge Universality for Inhomogeneous Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetric and Hermitian random matrices whose entries are independent and symmetric random variables with an arbitrary variance pattern. Under a novel Short-to-Long Mixing condition, which is sharp in the sense that it precludes a corrected shift at the spectral edge, we establish GOE/GUE edge universality for such inhomogeneous random matrices. This condition effectively reduces the universality problem to verifying the mixing properties of a random walk governed by the variance profile matrix.
  Our universality results are applicable to a remarkably broad class of random matrix ensembles that may be highly inhomogeneous, sparse, or far beyond the mean-field setting of classical random matrix theory. Notable examples include:
  1. Inhomogeneous Wishart-type random matrices;
  2. Random band matrices whose entries are independent random variables with general variance profile, particularly with an optimal bandwidth in dimensions $d \le 2$;
  3. Sparse random matrices with structured variance profiles;
  4. Generalized Wigner matrices under significantly weaker sparsity constraints and heavy-tailed entry distributions;
  5. Wegner orbital models under sharp mixing assumptions;
  6. Random 2-lifts of random $d$-regular graphs where $d\geq N^{2/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spacetimes in $f(G)$-gravity: Bianchi I, Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological anisotropies within the framework of $f\left(G\right)$-gravity. Specifically, we consider a locally rotationally symmetric geometry in four-dimensional spacetime that describes the Bianchi I, Bianchi III, and the Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes. Within this context, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier which allows us to reformulate the geometric degrees of freedom in terms of a scalar field. The resulting theory is dynamically equivalent to an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field model. We normalize the field equations by introducing dimensionless variables. The dynamics of our system is then explored by solving the resulting nonlinear differential equations numerically for various sets of initial conditions. Our analysis reveals the existence of two finite attractors: the Minkowski universe and an isotropic, spatially flat solution capable of describing accelerated expansion. Although de Sitter expansion may be recovered, it appears only as an unstable solution. In addition, the theory suffers from the existence of Big Rip singularities.</description>

Abstract: We derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplace and Steklov operators in the exterior of the unit disk in the strong magnetic field limit. This improves recent results of Helffer-Nicoleau (2025) based on special function asymptotics, and extends earlier works by Fournais-Helffer (2006), Kachmar (2006), and R. Fahs, L. Treust, N. Raymond, S. V\~u Ng\d{o}c (2024). Notably, our analysis reveals how the third term encodes the dependence on the magnetic flux. Finally, we investigate the weak magnetic field limit and establish the flux dependence in the asymptotics of Kachmar-Lotoreichik-Sundqvist (2025).</description>

Abstract: We prove that field operators in a Wightman quantum field theory generally have self-adjoint extensions. If the theory is bosonic and the field operators also obey canonical commutation relations (CCRs), then the Weyl form of the CCRs exits. This entails that the field operators emerge from the corresponding CCR algebra, which is a unique C$^\ast$-algebra and which is determined by the two-point Wightman function.</description>

      <title>A continuum limit for dense spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07086v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems -- such as optical waveguide lattices and dense neuronal or vascular networks -- can be modeled by metric graphs, where slender "wires" (edges) support wave or diffusion equations subject to Kirchhoff conditions at the nodes. This work proposes a continuum-limit framework that replaces edge-based equations with a global coarse-grained partial differential equation (PDE) defined on the continuous space occupied by the network. The derivation naturally introduces an edge-conductivity tensor, an edge-capacity function, and a vertex number density to encode how each microscopic patch of the graph contributes to the macroscopic phenomena. The results have interesting similarities and differences with the Riemannian Laplace-Beltrami operator. We calculate all macroscopic parameters from first principles via a systematic discrete-to-continuous local homogenization, finding an anomalous effective embedding dimension resulting from a homogenized diffusivity. Numerical examples -- including an axisymmetric "spiderweb", several periodic lattices, random Delaunay triangulations, nearest-neighbor geometric graphs, and aperiodic monotiles -- demonstrate that each finite model converges to its corresponding PDE (posed on different manifolds like tori, disks, and spheres) in the limit of increasing vertex density.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Helmholtz--Korteweg equation, which models acoustic waves in Korteweg fluids. We further derive a nematic variant of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation, which incorporates an additional orientational term in the stress tensor. Its dispersion relation coincides with that arising in Virga's analysis of the Euler-Korteweg equations, which we extend to consider imaginary wave numbers and the effect of boundary conditions. In particular, our extensions allow us to analyze the effect of nematic orientation on the penetration depth of evanescent plane waves, and on the scattering of sound waves by obstacles. Furthermore, we make new, experimentally-verifiable predictions for the effect of boundary conditions for a modification of the Mullen-L\"uthi-Stephen experiment, and for the scattering of acoustic waves in nematic-Korteweg fluids by a circular obstacle.</description>

      <title>On the Lieb--Wehrl Entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of $SU(N,1)$. These inequalities are rooted in Wehrl's definition of semiclassical entropy and his conjecture about its minimum value. Lieb resolved this conjecture in 1978, posing a similar question for Bloch coherent states of $SU(2)$. The $SU(2)$ conjecture was settled by Lieb and Solovej in 2014, and the conjecture was extended for a wide class of Lie groups. The generalized Lieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups, including $SU(N),\, N\geq 2$, $SU(1,1)$, and its $AX+B$ subgroup. Under the Li--Su assumption on isoperimetric regions in the complex hyperbolic ball, our sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms extend this resolution to $SU(N,1),\, N\geq 2$. Additionally, we explore the Faber--Krahn inequality, which applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. This inequality was previously proven by Nicola and Tilli and later extended by Ramos and Tilli to the wavelet transform. In this paper, we further extend this result within the framework of the Bergman space $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$.</description>

Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized parity-time-reversal ($PT$) symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. {The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator $L:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$, which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection $\tau:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $L^\dagger=\tau L\,\tau^{-1}$. We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators}, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. {This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators $\tau$ and $X$ that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.</description>

      <title>A Homothetic Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the principle of local gauge invariance forms the bedrock of modern physics, the symmetry of scale invariance has traditionally been treated on a different footing. This paper develops a \emph{homothetic gauge theory} (HGT) that elevates local scale transformations to a genuine gauge symmetry, placing them within the same geometric framework as conventional interactions. We introduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle that linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a homothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When this formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields a generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the standard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local scale. The resulting dynamics, including modified conservation laws and wave equations, are shown to be fully consistent. As a significant physical application, this framework provides a compelling resolution to the classical problem of the infinite self-energy of a point charge. By modeling the source as a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition on a shrinking interface, we construct a non-singular electrostatic potential, thereby removing the divergence in a natural, geometric manner without introducing ad-hoc regularization schemes. The emergence of penalty terms due to essentially geometric transformations promises a physically meaningful theory, and encourages to re-examining the role of scale invariance in other areas of classical and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Brown measure of the sum of an elliptic operator and a free random variable in a finite von Neumann algebra</title>

Abstract: Given an $n\times n$ random matrix $X_n$ with i.i.d. entries of unit variance, the circular law says that the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $X_n/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the uniform measure on the unit disk. Let $M_n$ be a deterministic matrix that converges in $*$-moments to an operator ${x}$. It is known from the work by \'{S}niady and Tao--Vu that the ESD of $X_n/\sqrt{n}+M_n$ converges to the Brown measure of ${x}+c$, where $c$ is Voiculescu's circular operator. We obtain a formula for the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ which provides a description of the limit distribution. This answers a question of Biane--Lehner for arbitrary operator ${x}$.
  Generalizing the case of circular and semi-circular operators, we also consider a family of twisted elliptic operators that are $*$-free from ${x}$. For an arbitrary twisted elliptic operator $g$, possible degeneracy then prevents a direct calculation of the Brown measure of ${x}+g$. We instead show that the whole family of Brown measures are the push-forward measures of the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ under a family of self-maps of the plane, which could possibly be singular. We calculate explicit formula for the case ${x}$ is self-adjoint. In addition, we prove that the Brown measure of the sum of an $R$-diagonal operator and a twisted elliptic element is supported in a deformed ring where the inner boundary is a circle and the outer boundary is an ellipse.
  These results generalize some known results about free additive Brownian motions where the free random variable ${x}$ is assumed to be self-adjoint. The approach is based on a Hermitian reduction and subordination functions.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Marginal-Likelihood Calibration with Application to Quantum Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a marginal likelihood strategy within the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process (GP) models the discrepancy between a physical system and its simulator. Our approach introduces a novel marginalized likelihood by integrating out the degenerate eigenspace of the covariance matrix, rather than approximating the original likelihood. Unlike approximation methods that compromise accuracy for computational efficiency, our method defines an exact likelihood -- distinct from the original but preserving all relevant information. This formulation achieves computational efficiency and stability, even for large datasets where the covariance matrix nears degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a superconducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data.</description>

      <title>On the space-time fluctuations of the SHE and KPZ equation in the entire $L^{2}$-regime for spatial dimensions $d \geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mollified versions of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and the stochastic heat equation (SHE) in high dimensions $d\geq 3$ and analyze their probability distributions as the mollification is removed. Up to the $L^2$-criticality, we prove Gaussian limits, possibly with random perturbations, for the space-time fluctuations of the mollified versions around their stationarity. This result establishes a continuous analogue of the discrete case obtained by Cosco and Nakajima (2021), and further extends it to a multi-point framework.</description>

      <title>Modularity of admissible-level $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ minimal models with denominator $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the simple affine vertex algebra $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$ associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ at level $\mathsf{k} = -3+\frac{\mathsf{u}}{2}$, for $\mathsf{u}\ge3$ odd. Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Mutual information from modular flow in CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators in the replica trick framework enables a long-distance expansion of the mutual information (MI) in conformal field theories (CFTs). In this expansion, the terms are labeled by primary operators, as contributions from descendant operators can be resummed into conformal blocks. However, for the MI, the expansion involves primaries from the multi-replica theory, which includes far more operators than those in the original theory. In this work, we develop a method to resum this series, yielding an expansion in terms of the primaries of the original theory, specifically restricted to the two-copy sector. This is achieved by expressing the twist operators in a non-local manner across different replicas and using a modular flow representation to obtain the n -&gt; 1 limit of the R\'enyi index. We explicitly compute the resulting "enhanced conformal blocks", which, surprisingly, provide excellent approximations to the MI of generalized free fields across the full range of cross ratios. Remarkably, this approximation appears to be exact in the limit of large spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

      <title>A basic triad in Macdonald theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding the Macdonald polynomials into the Noumi-Shiraishi functions and their reduction to solutions of simple linear equations at particular values of $t$. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory. We discuss lifting the triad to an elliptic generalization of the Noumi-Shiraishi functions. The central unknown ingredient is linear equations, for which we discuss various possible approaches, including immediate elliptic deformation of periodicity conditions, (elliptic) Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra operators, and elliptic Kostka coefficients.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strenghts has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems on the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) extend the equations of incompressible Hall MHD (HMHD) by retaining finite-electron inertia. These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement incompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality, which distinguish it from classical physics. These phenomena are often studied separately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a unified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them. By representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of column-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections between different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a new perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility. We also investigate the symmetric $n$-extensions of multimeters and no-signaling behaviors and connect these extensions to a notion of $n$-wise compatibility and to the existence of $n$-wise LHV models, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by examining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces, providing geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by simpler measurement settings.</description>

Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules. For example, the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, with one of its flavor components slightly differing from the other two, deviates from the exact $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, and this deviation is characterized by the exact $SU(3)$ flavor octet.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Radon transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms implies the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. In the standard theory of generalized functions, if the outset (origin) function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule, the complexity of Radon transforms becomes in question. In the paper, we discuss the Fourier slice theorem analyzing the degenerated (singular) points as possible sources of the complexity. We also demonstrate the different methods to generate the needed complexity on the intermediate stage of calculations. Besides, we show that the introduction of the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensures naturally the corresponding complexity. The discussed complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented methods can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the KMP model to the KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <title>Smallest gaps of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with a general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>

      <title>Ideal Fermi gas in the Dunkl formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas within the framework of the Dunkl formalism, which incorporates deformation effects through reflection symmetric differential operators. The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. We introduce novel vector-norm analysis and prove that the number of time-steps can be reduced by a factor exponential in the number of qubits compared to previously established operator-norm analysis, thereby significantly lowering the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>
