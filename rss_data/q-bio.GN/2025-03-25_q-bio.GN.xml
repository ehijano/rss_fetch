      <title>Reconstructing Cell Lineage Trees from Phenotypic Features with Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How a single fertilized cell gives rise to a complex array of specialized cell types in development is a central question in biology. The cells grow, divide, and acquire differentiated characteristics through poorly understood molecular processes. A key approach to studying developmental processes is to infer the tree graph of cell lineage division and differentiation histories, providing an analytical framework for dissecting individual cells' molecular decisions during replication and differentiation. Although genetically engineered lineage-tracing methods have advanced the field, they are either infeasible or ethically constrained in many organisms. In contrast, modern single-cell technologies can measure high-content molecular profiles (e.g., transcriptomes) in a wide range of biological systems.
  Here, we introduce CellTreeQM, a novel deep learning method based on transformer architectures that learns an embedding space with geometric properties optimized for tree-graph inference. By formulating lineage reconstruction as a tree-metric learning problem, we have systematically explored supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised training settings and present a Lineage Reconstruction Benchmark to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of our learning method. We benchmarked the method on (1) synthetic data modeled via Brownian motion with independent noise and spurious signals and (2) lineage-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Experimental results show that CellTreeQM recovers lineage structures with minimal supervision and limited data, offering a scalable framework for uncovering cell lineage relationships in challenging animal models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to cast cell lineage inference explicitly as a metric learning task, paving the way for future computational models aimed at uncovering the molecular dynamics of cell lineage.</description>

      <title>Gene42: Long-Range Genomic Foundation Model With Dense Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Gene42, a novel family of Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) designed to manage context lengths of up to 192,000 base pairs (bp) at a single-nucleotide resolution. Gene42 models utilize a decoder-only (LLaMA-style) architecture with a dense self-attention mechanism. Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data. Extensive experiments on various genomic benchmarks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including biotype classification, regulatory region identification, chromatin profiling prediction, variant pathogenicity prediction, and species classification. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</description>
