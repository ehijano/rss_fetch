      <title>Proton Flows, Proton Gradients and Subcellular Architecture in Biological Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen ions, or protons, provide the medium by which energy is stored and converted in biological systems. Such pre-eminence relies on the interplay between interfacial and bulk chemical transformations, according to mechanisms that are shared by organisms in all phyla of life. The present work provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of biological energy management by focusing on the relationship between vectorial proton flows and the geometry of energy producing organelles in eukaryotes. The leading models of proton-mediated energy conversion, the delocalised proton (or chemiosmotic) model and the localised proton model, are presented in a complementary perspective. While the delocalised model provides a description that relies on equilibrium thermodynamics, the localised model addresses dynamic processes that are better described using out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. The work reviews the salient aspects of such mechanisms, traces the development of our present understanding, and highlights areas that are open to future developments.</description>

      <title>Capacitive response of biological membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${\tau_{\rm C} =\dfrac{\lambda_{\rm D}L}{D}\left(\dfrac{2+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/L}{4+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/\lambda_{\rm D}}\right)}$, where $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $\Gamma$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $\delta^{\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${\lambda_{\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${\tau_{\rm L} =L^2/4\pi^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.</description>
