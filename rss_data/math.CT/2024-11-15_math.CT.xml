      <title>Simons Lectures on Categorical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Categorical Symmetries are a powerful new tool for analyzing quantum field theories. This volume compiles lecture notes from the 2022 and 2023 summer schools on Global Categorical Symmetries, held at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and at the Swiss Map Research Station in Les Diableret. Specifically, this volume collects the lectures:
  * An introduction to symmetries in quantum field theory, Kantaro Ohmori
  * Introduction to anomalies in quantum field theory, Clay C\'ordova
  * Symmetry Categories 101, Michele Del Zotto
  * Applied Cobordism Hypothesis, David Jordan
  * Finite symmetry in QFT, Daniel S. Freed
  These volumes are devoted to interested newcomers: we only assume (basic) knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and some relevant maths. We try to give appropriate references for non-standard materials that are not covered. Our aim in this first volume is to illustrate some of the main questions and ideas together with some of the methods and the techniques necessary to begin exploring global categorical symmetries of QFTs.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetries in 6d from Green-Schwarz Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct non-invertible symmetries in 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal field theories that arise from Green-Schwarz (GS) automorphisms, which form abelian or non-abelian groups. Applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $S_3$ GS automorphisms, gives rise to non-invertible duality, triality and $S_3$-ality defects, respectively, once combined with stacking symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs) and gauging 2-form symmetries. We derive the defects and their fusion rules from two distinct perspectives: from half-space gauging as well as from the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This is the first concrete construction of symmetry defects in 6d forming a fusion 5-category whose fusions are intrinsically non-invertible and non-abelian.</description>

      <title>The Higher Structure of Symmetries of Axion-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries of quantum field theories are characterized by topological defects/operators organized into a higher category. In this paper we consider the Axion-Maxwell field theory in four dimensions and, building on the construction of its topological defects by Choi, Lam, Shao, Hidaka, Nitta and Yokokura, we discuss field theoretical methods to compute some aspects of the higher structure of such category. In particular, we determine explicitly the generalized $F$-symbols for the non-invertible electric 1-form symmetry of the theory. Along the way we clarify various aspects of the bottom-up worldvolume approach towards the calculus of defects.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>

      <title>Twisted post-Hopf algebras, twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators and Hopf trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article is devoted to study the categorical relationships between the categories of Hopf trusses, weak twisted post-Hopf algebras and weak twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter objects are a generalisation of relative Rota-Baxter operators where the Rota-Baxter condition is modified through a cocycle. Under certain conditions, this work shows that the three aforementioned categories are equivalent.</description>

      <title>A new approach to flatness in categories of sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have embraced the study of certain properties of modules such as projectivity, injectivity and flatness from an alternative point of view. This way, Durgun has introduced absolutely pure domains of modules as a mean to gauge the extent of the flatness of any given module (so not just to determine whether or not the module is flat). In this paper, we develop a new treatment of the goemetric flatness in categories of sheaves which shed more light on some of its various important aspects. Namely, in terms of this new approach, some classical schemes are characterized, some new results are established and also known ones are generalized.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Dowker duality, profunctors, and spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intent of this paper is to explore Dowker duality from a combinatorial, topological, and categorical perspective. The paper presents three short, new proofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce modifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational join and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be constructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which includes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In this more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial complexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence. Similar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations of relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role of the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that arise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly, we show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$, and the cograph form a long exact sequence.</description>
