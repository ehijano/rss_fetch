      <title>Variable L0 Guidance Strategy: Enlarged Operational Envelope and Path-Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric and theoretical study of an exponentially varying look-ahead parameter for UAV path-following guidance. Conventional guidance laws with a fixed look-ahead distance often drive the vehicle into turn-rate saturation when the heading or cross-track error is large, leading to constrained maneuvers and higher control effort. The proposed variable L0 strategy reshapes the look-ahead profile so that the guidance command adapts to the evolving tracking error geometry. A detailed investigation shows that this adaptation significantly enlarges the region in which the commanded turn rate remains unsaturated, allowing the vehicle to operate smoothly over a broader range of error conditions. For representative settings, the unsaturated operational envelope increases by more than 70% relative to the constant L0 formulation. These geometric insights translate to smoother trajectories, earlier recovery from saturation, and reduced control demand. Simulation studies on straight-line and elliptical paths demonstrate the merits of the variable look-ahead strategy, highlighting its control-efficient and reliable path-following performance.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Observer for Air-Velocity and Attitude Estimation Using Pitot and Barometric Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating air velocity and full attitude for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied environments using minimal onboard sensing-an interesting and practically relevant challenge for UAV navigation. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (i) an observability analysis establishing the conditions for uniform observability, which are useful for trajectory planning and motion control of the UAV; and (ii) the design of a nonlinear observer on SO3R3R that incorporates pitot-tube, barometric altitude, and magnetometer measurements as outputs, with IMU data used as inputs, within a unified framework. Simulation results are presented to confirm the convergence and robustness of the proposed design, including under minimally excited trajectories.</description>

      <title>Sparse Neural Approximations for Bilevel Adversarial Problems in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adversarial worst-case load shedding (AWLS) problem is pivotal for identifying critical contingencies under line outages. It is naturally cast as a bilevel program: the upper level simulates an attacker determining worst-case line failures, and the lower level corresponds to the defender's generator redispatch operations. Conventional techniques using optimality conditions render the bilevel, mixed-integer formulation computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorial number of topologies and the nonconvexity of AC power flow constraints. To address these challenges, we develop a novel single-level optimal value-function (OVF) reformulation and further leverage a data-driven neural network (NN) surrogate of the follower's optimal value. To ensure physical realizability, we embed the trained surrogate in a physics-constrained NN (PCNN) formulation that couples the OVF inequality with (relaxed) AC feasibility, yielding a mixed-integer convex model amenable to off-the-shelf solvers. To achieve scalability, we learn a sparse, area-partitioned NN via spectral clustering; the resulting block-sparse architecture scales essentially linearly with system size while preserving accuracy. Notably, our approach produces near-optimal worst-case failures and generalizes across loading conditions and unseen topologies, enabling rapid online recomputation. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems demonstrate the method's scalability and solution quality for large-scale contingency analysis, with an average optimality gap of 5.8% compared to conventional methods, while maintaining computation times under one minute.</description>

      <title>Explainable LP-MPC: Shadow Price Contributions Reveal MV-CV Pairings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large industrial LP-MPC (Linear Program-Model Predictive Control) systems contain tens to hundreds of manipulated variables (MVs) and controlled variables (CVs) for honoring constraints while operating at plant-wide economic optima. The LP is a white-box model, yet for a number of reasons, abnormal behaviors in industrial controllers are often difficult to rationalize. We introduce a novel, post-hoc LP explainability method by recasting the role of shadow prices in the LP solution as an attribution mechanism for MV-CV relationships. The core idea is that CV shadow prices are not just intrinsic properties of the optimal solution, but an aggregate of the cost sensitivities contributed by MVs in enforcing CV constraints, which is then resolved into one-to-one MV-CV pairings using a linear sum assignment solution. The proposed MV-CV pairing framework serves as a practical explainability tool for online LP-MPC systems, enabling practitioners to diagnose suboptimal constraints and verify alignment of the controller's behavior with its original design intent and historical constraints.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Fixed Skyroad Model for Continuous UAS Traffic Management (C-UTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike traditional multi-agent coordination frameworks, which assume a fixed number of agents, UAS traffic management (UTM) requires a platform that enables Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) to freely enter or exit constrained low-altitude airspace. Consequently, the number of UAS operating in a given region is time-varying, with vehicles dynamically joining or leaving even in dense, obstacle-laden environments. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a computationally efficient management system that maximizes airspace usability while ensuring safety and efficiency. To achieve this, we first introduce physics-informed methods to structure fixed skyroads across multiple altitude layers of urban airspace, with the directionality of each skyroad designed to guarantee full reachability. We then present a novel Continuous UTM (C-UTM) framework that optimally allocates skyroads to UAS requests while accounting for the time-varying capacity of the airspace. Collectively, the proposed model addresses the key challenges of low-altitude UTM by providing a scalable, safe, and efficient solution for urban airspace usability.</description>

      <title>Scale-free weak output synchronization of multi-agent systems with adaptive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study output synchronization for multi-agent systems. The objective is to design a protocol which only depends on the agent dynamics and does not require any knowledge of the network. If the network has a directed spanning tree then the protocols designed in this paper achieve classical output synchronization. Otherwise, the protocol achieves weak synchronization which is induced by network stability in the sense that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. Weak sychronization is explained in detail in this paper. Even though we consider linear agents, it is known that this in general requires nonlinear protocols. In the paper we use adaptive protocols. In the literature, two classes of protocols are considered often called collaborative protocols (with additional communication between the protocols and non-collaborative protocols (sometimes referred to as fully decentralized where the additional communication is not present). This paper considers both of these cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Platoon Formation and Stable Benefit Allocation in Mixed-Energy Truck Fleets under Size Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cooperative platoon formation and benefit allocation in mixed-energy truck fleets composed of both electric and fuel-powered trucks. The central challenge arises from the platoon-size constraint, which limits the number of trucks permitted in each platoon and introduces combinatorial coupling into the search for optimal platoon formation structures. We formulate this problem as a coalitional game with bounded coalition sizes and derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal coalition structure that maximizes the fleet-wide platooning benefit. Building on this structure, we develop a type-based least-core payoff allocation scheme that guarantees stability within the coalition-structure core (CS-core). For cases in which the CS-core is empty, we compute the least-core radius to determine the minimal relaxation required to achieve approximate stability. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves the highest total platooning benefit among all feasible formation configurations while providing stable benefit allocations that outperform existing baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a noise-centric formulation of the distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) for discrete-time linear stochastic systems with uncertain noise statistics. By placing Wasserstein ambiguity sets directly on the process and measurement noise distributions, the proposed DRKF preserves the analytical structure of the classical Kalman filter while providing a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances. In the time-invariant setting, we derive a steady-state DRKF from a single stationary semidefinite program, yielding a constant-gain estimator with the same per-step computational complexity as the standard Kalman filter. We establish conditions guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of this steady-state solution, and we prove its asymptotic minimax optimality with respect to the worst-case mean-square error. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that the proposed DRKF improves estimation accuracy under unknown or uncertain noise models while offering computational advantages over existing robust and distributionally robust filters.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Physics-Based and Reinforcement Learning Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Time Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a hybrid prediction framework for accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging time estimation, a capability that is critical for trip planning, user satisfaction, and efficient operation of charging infrastructure. We combine a physics-based analytical model with a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The analytical component captures the nonlinear constant-current/constant-voltage (CC--CV) charging dynamics and explicitly models state-of-health (SoH)--dependent capacity and power fade, providing a reliable baseline when historical data are limited. Building on this foundation, we introduce an RL component that progressively refines charging-time predictions as operational data accumulate, enabling improved long-term adaptation. Both models incorporate SoH degradation to maintain predictive accuracy over the battery lifetime. We evaluate the framework using $5{,}000$ simulated charging sessions calibrated to manufacturer specifications and publicly available EV charging datasets. Our results show that the analytical model achieves $R^{2}=98.5\%$ and $\mathrm{MAPE}=2.1\%$, while the RL model further improves performance to $R^{2}=99.2\%$ and $\mathrm{MAPE}=1.6\%$, corresponding to a $23\%$ accuracy gain and $35\%$ improved robustness to battery aging.</description>

      <title>Control-Oriented System Identification: Classical, Learning, and Physics-Informed Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey classical, machine learning, and data-driven system identification approaches to learn control-relevant and physics-informed models of dynamical systems. Recently, machine learning approaches have enabled system identification from noisy, high-dimensional, and complex data. However, their utility is limited by their ability to provide provable guarantees on control-relevant properties. Meanwhile, control theory has identified several properties that are useful in analysis and control synthesis, such as dissipativity, monotonicity, energy conservation, and symmetry-preserving structures. We posit that merging system identification with such control-relevant or physics-informed properties can provide useful inductive bias, enhance explainability, enable control synthesis with provable guarantees, and improve sample complexity. We formulate system identification as an optimization problem where control-relevant properties can be enforced through direct parameterization (constraining the model structure to satisfy a desired property by construction), soft constraints (encouraging control-relevant properties through regularization or penalty terms), and hard constraints (imposing control-relevant properties as constraints in the optimization problem). Through this lens, we survey methods to learn physics-informed and control-relevant models spanning classical linear and nonlinear system identification, machine learning approaches, and direct identification through data-driven and behavioral representations. We also provide several expository examples that are accompanied by code and brief tutorials on a public Github repository. We also describe challenging directions for future research, including identification in networked, switched, and time-varying systems, experiment design, and bridging the gaps between data-driven, learning-based, and control-oriented approaches.</description>

      <title>Data Generation for Stability Studies of Power Systems with High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the E-Rocket, an electric-powered, low-cost rocket prototype for validation of Guidance, Navigation &amp; Control (GNC) algorithms based on Thrust Vector Control (TVC). Relying on commercially available components and 3D printed parts, a pair of contra-rotating DC brushless motors is assembled on a servo-actuated gimbal mechanism that provides thrust vectoring capability. A custom avionics hardware and software stack is developed considering a dual computer setup which leverages the capabilities of the PX4 autopilot and the modularity of ROS 2 to accommodate for tailored GNC algorithms. The platform is validated in an indoor motion-capture arena using a baseline PID-based trajectory tracking controller. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking and confirm the suitability of the E-Rocket as a versatile testbed for rocket GNC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Aerial Transport in the Presence of Cooperative and Uncooperative UAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a resilient deep neural network (DNN) framework for decentralized transport and coverage using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) operating in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The proposed DNN-based mass-transport architecture constructs a layered inter-UAS communication graph from an initial formation, assigns time-varying communication weights through a forward scheduling mechanism that guides the team from the initial to the final configuration, and ensures stability and convergence of the resulting multi-agent transport dynamics. The framework is explicitly designed to remain robust in the presence of uncooperative agents that deviate from or refuse to follow the prescribed protocol. Our method preserves a fixed feed-forward topology but dynamically prunes edges to uncooperative agents, maintains convex, feedforward mentoring among cooperative agents, and computes global desired set points through a sparse linear relation consistent with leader references. The target set is abstracted by $N$ points that become final desired positions, enabling coverage-optimal transport while keeping computation low and guarantees intact. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, under full cooperation, all agents converge rapidly to the target zone with a 10\% boundary margin and under partial cooperation with uncooperative agents, the system maintains high convergence among cooperative agents with performance degradation localized near the disruptions, evidencing graceful resilience and scalability. These results confirm that forward-weight scheduling, hierarchical mentor--mentee coordination, and on-the-fly DNN restructuring yield robust, provably stable UAS transport in realistic fault scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Reachability of Energy Storage Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems face increasing weather-driven variability and, therefore, increasingly rely on flexible but energy-limited storage resources. Energy storage can buffer this variability, but its value depends on intertemporal decisions under uncertain prices. Without accounting for the future reliability value of stored energy, batteries may act myopically, discharging too early or failing to preserve reserves during critical hours. This paper introduces a stopping-time reward that, together with a state-of-charge (SoC) range target penalty, aligns arbitrage incentives with system reliability by rewarding storage that maintains sufficient SoC before critical hours. We formulate the problem as an online optimization with a chance-constrained terminal SoC and embed it in an end-to-end (E2E) learning framework, jointly training the price predictor and control policy. The proposed design enhances reachability of target SoC ranges, improves profit under volatile conditions, and reduces its standard deviation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely employed in high-performance drive systems owing to their high efficiency and power density. However, nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainties, and load disturbances complicate their control. Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) offers strong robustness but exists in numerous variants with unstandardized evaluation criteria. This paper presents a unified simulation benchmark and comparative analysis of six representative SMC techniques for PMSM speed regulation: conventional, integral, terminal, fractional-order, adaptive, and super-twisting. A standardized PMSM model, disturbance profile, and tuning protocol are adopted to ensure fair comparison across all methods. Performance is assessed through time-domain responses, integral error indices (ISE, IAE, ITSE, ITAE), and control-effort profiles, while also examining computational complexity and implementation feasibility. Results demonstrate that adaptive and higher-order SMCs, particularly the super-twisting and adaptive variants, achieve the most balanced trade-off between robustness, smoothness, and computational cost. The study provides a reproducible benchmarking framework, parameter-selection guidelines, and practical insights for designing efficient, low-chatter SMC-based PMSM drives suitable for real-time embedded implementation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven functional state estimation of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal state of a dynamical system, a set of variables that defines its evolving configuration, is often hidden and cannot be fully measured, posing a central challenge for real-time monitoring and control. While observers are designed to estimate these latent states from sensor outputs, their classical designs rely on precise system models, which are often unattainable for complex network systems. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework for estimating a targeted set of state variables, known as functional observers, without identifying the model parameters. We establish a fundamental functional observability criterion based on historical trajectories that guarantees the existence of such observers. We then develop methods to construct observers using either input-output data or partial state data. These observers match or exceed the performance of model-based counterparts while remaining applicable even to unobservable systems. The framework incorporates noise mitigation and can be easily extended to nonlinear networks via Koopman embeddings. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications including sensor fault detection in water networks, load-frequency control in power grids, and target estimation in nonlinear neuronal systems. Our work provides a practical route for real-time target state inference in complex systems where models are unavailable.</description>

      <title>From Forecast to Action: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Power Outages During Tropical Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power outages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) pose serious risks to electric power systems and the communities they serve. Accurate, high-resolution outage forecasting is essential for enabling both proactive mitigation planning and real-time emergency response. This study introduces the SpatioTemporal Outage ForeCAST (STO-CAST) model, a deep learning framework developed for real-time, regional-scale outage prediction during TC events with high-resolution outputs in both space and time. STO-CAST integrates static environmental and infrastructure attributes with dynamic meteorological and outage sequences using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully connected layers, and is trained via a Leave-One-Storm-Out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy along with holdout grid experiments to demonstrate its preliminary generalization capability to unseen storms and grids. The model produces hourly outage forecasts at a 4 km * 4 km resolution and supports dual forecasting modes: short-term nowcasting with a 6-hour lead time via assimilation of real-time observations, and long-term forecasting with a 60-hour lead time based on evolving meteorological projections. A case study on Typhoon Muifa (2022) demonstrates STO-CAST's operational effectiveness, including error decomposition across model design, meteorological uncertainty, and observation gaps, while highlighting the value of real-time data assimilation and the model's capacity to identify evolving outage hotspots. STO-CAST offers a scalable, data-driven solution to support risk-informed emergency response and enhance power system resilience under intensifying TC threats.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Formation Control on Cycle Graphs Using Dihedral Point Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a symmetry-based framework for formation control on cycle graphs using Dihedral point-group constraints. We show that enforcing inter-agent reflection symmetries, together with anchoring a single designated agent to its prescribed mirror axis, is sufficient to realize every $\mathcal{C}_{nv}$-symmetric configuration using only $n-1$ communication links. The resulting control laws have a matrix-weighted Laplacian structure and guarantee exponential convergence to the desired symmetric configuration. Furthermore, we extend the method to enable coordinated maneuvers along a time-varying reference trajectory. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic State Estimation in V2X-Enabled Connected Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed traffic state estimation framework in which infrastructure sensors and connected vehicles act as autonomous, cooperative sensing nodes. These nodes share local traffic estimates with nearby nodes using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The proposed estimation algorithm uses a distributed Kalman filter tailored to a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. To achieve global state awareness, the algorithm employs a consensus protocol to fuse heterogeneous spatiotemporal estimates from V2X neighbors and applies explicit projection steps to maintain physical consistency in density and flow estimates. The algorithm's performance is validated through microscopic simulations of a highway segment experiencing transient congestion. Results demonstrate that the proposed distributed estimator accurately reconstructs nonlinear shockwave dynamics, even with sparse infrastructure sensors and intermittent vehicular network connectivity. Statistical analysis explores how different connected vehicle penetration rates affect estimation accuracy, revealing notable phase transitions in network observability.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Aware Attention LSTM Autoencoder for Early Fault Diagnosis of Battery Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery safety is paramount for electric vehicles. Early fault diagnosis remains a challenge due to the subtle nature of anomalies and the interference of dynamic operating noise. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from "physical blindness" leading to missed detections or false alarms. To address this, we propose a Physics-Aware Attention LSTM Autoencoder (PA-ALSTM-AE). This novel framework explicitly integrates battery aging laws (mileage) into the deep learning pipeline through a multi-stage fusion mechanism. Specifically, an adaptive physical feature construction module selects mileage-sensitive features, and a physics-guided latent fusion module dynamically calibrates the memory cells of the LSTM based on the aging state. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Vloong real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it improves the recall rate of early faults by over 3 times while maintaining high precision, offering a robust solution for industrial battery management systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Abstraction-Based Hierarchical Control and Moment Matching: A Conceptual Unification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between approximate-simulation-based hierarchical control (ASHC) and moment matching techniques, and build a conceptual bridge between these two frameworks. To this end, we study the two key requirements of the ASHC technique, namely the bounded output discrepancy and the $M$-relation, through the lens of moment matching. We show that, in the linear time-invariant case, both requirements can be interpreted in the moment matching perspective through certain system interconnection structures. Building this conceptual bridge provides a foundation for cross-pollination of ideas between these two frameworks.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Feasibility-Aware Signal Temporal Logic and BarrierNet for Robust and Correct Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Synergies between AI Computing and Power Systems: Metrics, Scheduling, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first clarify the concepts of green AI versus frugal AI, positioning frugality as efficiency by design and green AI as transparency and accountability. We then argue that these approaches, while complementary, are insufficient without a shared quantitative foundation that links AI computing to power system contexts. This motivates the development of standardized carbon metrics as a bridge between algorithmic decisions and their physical consequences. We next embed these signals into scheduling and planning frameworks, presenting two architectures: (i) an iterative signal-response loop for real-time operations, and (ii) an integrated optimization that learns and encodes flexible-load behavior for long-term planning. Finally, we show how the same coordination stack supports resilience, enabling signals to shift from emissions-first to stability-first during stress events, providing targeted relief and faster restoration.</description>

      <title>Green O-RAN Operation: a Modern ML-Driven Network Energy Consumption Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing energy demand of next-generation mobile networks, especially 6G, is becoming a major concern, particularly due to the high power usage of base station components RU, which often remain active even during low traffic periods. To tackle this challenge, our study focuses on improving energy efficiency in O-RAN systems using intelligent control strategies. TD3 leverages a continuous action space to overcome the limitations of traditional discrete-action methods like DQN. By avoiding exponential growth in action space, TD3 enables more precise control of RU sleep modes in dense and large radio environments. Simulation results show that our approach consistently achieves over 50% energy savings compared to the always-on baseline, with TD3 outperforming DQN-based methods by up to 6%, while also offering better stability and faster convergence.</description>

Abstract: Flexibility is increasingly gaining importance in modern power system operation. This paper presents a controller framework based on Online Feedback Optimization for real-time coordination of power system flexibility. The proposed approach introduces a momentum-augmented projection-step to accelerate convergence and improve dynamic performance. We derive the controller formulation, and evaluate its performance and stability in two representative case studies. The first examines online congestion management in distribution feeders, and the second addresses multi-layer flexibility dispatch across system interfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the momentum-based controller achieves faster convergence and maintains constraint satisfaction, highlighting its potential for real-time flexibility control in large-scale power systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of mobile animal populations is crucial for ecological research, wildlife management, and agricultural applications. Monitoring of bats specifically can help understand the spread of disease as well as shine light on bat migration patterns, population dynamics, and the impacts of environmental changes on bat colonies. Fixed sensing modalities, such as infrared sensors, cameras, radar, and acoustic detectors, play a pivotal role in tracking and understanding animal behavior. This survey goes over context-informing details about bat biology, and then reviews these fixed sensing modalities, discussing the unique challenges and contributions of each approach. We highlight the coverage, applications, accuracy, and limitations associated with each of these sensing modalities. By synthesizing recent advances, we provide a comprehensive overview to guide future research in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mountain huts are buildings located at high altitude, offering a place for hikers and providing shelter. Energy supply on mountain huts is still an open issue. Using renewable energies could be an appropriate solution. Jiujiu Cabins, a famous mountain hut in Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan, has operated an off-grid solar energy storage system (ESS) with lead-acid batteries. In 2021, a serious system failures took place, leading to no electricity. After an detailed on-site survey, a reorganization and repair project implemented, the energy system came back to operate normally. Meanwhile, a eco-friendly lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) ESS replaces part of the lead-acid battery ESS, forming a hybrid ESS, making a better and green off-grid solar ESS. In this case report, the energy architecture, detailed descriptions, and historical status of the system are provided. An on-site survey of the failed energy system, a system improvement project, and future plan are listed.</description>

Abstract: We study safety-critical control on fully actuated mechanical systems by means of Zeroing Control Barrier Functions (ZCBFs) defined on Lie Groups. Specifically, we introduce and theoretically validate two classes of ZCBFs. The first enforces kinematic constraints, suitable for implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms. The second enforces kinetic energy limits along prescribed inertial-frame translational and rotational directions, relevant for ensuring safe physical interaction. Numerical simulations involving slit traversal and safe landing scenarios are presented to validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel distributed framework for verifying the incremental stability of large-scale systems with unknown dynamics and known interconnection structures using graph neural networks. Our proposed approach relies on the construction of local incremental Lyapunov functions for subsystems, which are then composed together to obtain a suitable Lyapunov function for the interconnected system. Graph neural networks are used to synthesize these functions in a data-driven fashion. The formal correctness guarantee is then obtained by leveraging Lipschitz bounds of the trained neural networks. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is validated through two nonlinear case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical brain stimulation relies on externally applied currents to modulate neural activity, but safety constraints require each stimulation cycle to be charge-balanced, enforcing a zero net injected charge. However, how such charge-balanced stimulation works remains poorly understood. This paper investigates the ability of charge-balanced inputs to steer state trajectories in discrete-time linear systems. Motivated by both open-loop and adaptive neurostimulation protocols, we study two practically relevant input structures: periodic (repetitive) charge-balanced inputs and non-repetitive charge-balanced inputs. For each case, we derive novel reachability and controllability conditions. The theoretical results are further validated through numerical demonstrations of minimum-energy control input design.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Robust Safety Verification for Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven robust safety verification framework for stochastic dynamical systems modeled as Markov decision processes with time-varying and uncertain transition probabilities. Rather than assuming access to the exact nominal transition kernel, we consider the realistic setting where only samples from multiple system executions are available. These samples may correspond to different transition models inside an ambiguity set around the nominal transition kernel. Using these observations, we construct a unified ambiguity set that captures both inherent run-to-run variability in the transition dynamics and finite-sample statistical uncertainty. This ambiguity set is formalized through a Wasserstein-distance ball around a nominal empirical distribution and naturally induces an interval Markov decision process representation of the underlying system. Within this representation, we introduce a robust safety function that characterizes reach-avoid type probabilistic safety under all transition kernels consistent with the interval Markov decision process. We further derive high-confidence safety guarantees for the true, unknown time-varying system. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pulse Patterns through a Hybrid Optimal Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation method in which the switching angles and levels of a switching signal are computed via an offline optimization procedure to minimize a performance metric, typically the harmonic distortions of the load current. Additional constraints can be incorporated into the optimization problem to achieve secondary objectives, such as the limitation of specific harmonics or the reduction of power converter losses. The resulting optimization problem, however, is highly nonconvex, featuring a trigonometric objective function and constraints as well as both real- and integer-valued optimization variables. This work casts the task of OPP synthesis for a multilevel converter as an optimal control problem of a hybrid system. This problem is in turn lifted into a convex but infinite-dimensional conic program of occupation measures using established methods in convex relaxations of optimal control. Lower bounds on the minimum achievable harmonic distortion are acquired by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs via the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy, where each semidefinite program scales in a jointly linear manner with the numbers of permitted switching transitions and converter voltage levels.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Avoidance of UAV in Dynamic Environments Using Direction and Velocity-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $\omega(\theta,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers. The system ensures superior path integrity and reliable performance, confirming its viability for autonomous navigation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Control with Non-Markovian and Non-Semimartingale Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework assumes a Brownian noise process and relies on classical stochastic calculus tools, such as those based on It\^o calculus. In this paper, we solve a generalized linear quadratic optimal control problem where the process and measurement noises can be non-Markovian and non-semimartingale stochastic processes with sample paths that have low H\"older regularity. Since these noise models do not, in general, permit the use of the standard It\^o calculus, we employ rough path theory to formulate and solve the problem. By leveraging signature representations and controlled rough paths, we derive the optimal state estimation and control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the importance of monitoring the operational status of high-voltage cables in coal mines, this study investigates the application of intelligent sensing technology to the online monitoring of such cables. Taking an actual coal mine as a case study, a three-layer architecture high-voltage cable monitoring system was designed. The system employs high-frequency current sensors and distributed optical fiber temperature sensors to achieve real-time acquisition of partial discharge signals and temperature distribution data. Data analysis and fault diagnosis are performed through a combined approach of edge computing and cloud computing. The research results demonstrate that the system can accurately identify cable insulation defects and potential overheating hazards, with a diagnostic accuracy exceeding 95%, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability of power supply in mines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm to compute the explicit open-loop solution to both finite and infinite-horizon dynamic games subject to state and input constraints. Our approach relies on a multiparametric affine variational inequality characterization of the open-loop Nash equilibria and extends the classical explicit constrained LQR and MPC frameworks to multi-agent non-cooperative settings. A key practical implication is that linear-quadratic game-theoretic MPC becomes viable even at very high sampling rates for multi-agent systems of moderate size. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvements in online computation time and solution accuracy compared with state-of-the-art game-theoretic solvers.</description>

      <title>Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Power System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due the complexity of modern power systems, modeling based on first-order principles becomes increasingly difficult. As an alternative, dynamical models for simulation and control design can be obtained by black-box identification techniques. One such technique for the identification of continuous-time systems are neural ordinary differential equations. For training and inference, they require initial values of system states, such as phase angles and frequencies. While frequencies can typically be measured, phase angle measurements are usually not available. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel structure based on augmented neural ordinary differential equations, learning latent phase angle representations on historic observations with temporal convolutional networks. Our approach combines state-of-the art deep learning techniques, avoiding the necessity of phase angle information for the power system identification. Results show, that our approach clearly outperforms simpler augmentation techniques.</description>

      <title>Unifying Entropy Regularization in Optimal Control: From and Back to Classical Objectives via Iterated Soft Policies and Path Integral Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified perspective on several stochastic optimal control formulations through the lens of Kullback-Leibler regularization. We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curve-straight probabilistic engagement zones (CSPEZ) quantify the spatial regions an evader should avoid to reduce capture risk from a turn-rate-limited pursuer following a curve-straight path with uncertain parameters including position, heading, velocity, range, and maximum turn rate. This paper presents methods for generating evader trajectories that minimize capture risk under such uncertainty. We first derive an analytic solution for the deterministic curve-straight basic engagement zone (CSBEZ), then extend this formulation to a probabilistic framework using four uncertainty-propagation approaches: Monte Carlo sampling, linearization, quadratic approximation, and neural-network regression. We evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of each approximation method and demonstrate how CSPEZ constraints can be integrated into a trajectory-optimization algorithm to produce safe paths that explicitly account for pursuer uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Spatiotemporal Tubes for Dynamic Unsafe Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a real-time control framework for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy reach-avoid-stay tasks within a prescribed time in dynamic environments. To achieve this, we introduce a real-time spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework. An STT is defined as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius adapt online using only real-time sensory input. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is then derived to constrain the system output within the STT, ensuring safety and task satisfaction. We provide formal guarantees for obstacle avoidance and on-time task completion. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulations and hardware experiments on a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle, navigating in cluttered dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Situation-Aware Interactive MPC Switching for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable autonomous driving in interactive traffic scenarios, various model predictive control (MPC) formulations have been proposed, each employing different interaction models. While higher-fidelity models enable more intelligent behavior, they incur increased computational cost. Since strong interactions are relatively infrequent in traffic, a practical strategy for balancing performance and computational overhead is to invoke an appropriate controller based on situational demands. To achieve this approach, we first conduct a comparative study to assess and hierarchize the interactive capabilities of different MPC formulations. Furthermore, we develop a neural network-based classifier to enable situation-aware switching among controllers with different levels of interactive capability. We demonstrate that this situation-aware switching can both substantially improve overall performance by activating the most advanced interactive MPC in rare but critical situations, and significantly reduce computational load by using a basic MPC in the majority of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Defending Event-Triggered Systems against Out-of-Envelope Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of real-time systems is based on assumptions about environmental conditions in which they will operate. We call this their safe operational envelope. Violation of these assumptions, i.e., out-of-envelope environments, can jeopardize timeliness and safety of real-time systems, e.g., by overwhelming them with interrupt storms. A long-lasting debate has been going on over which design paradigm, the time- or event-triggered, is more robust against such behavior. In this work, we investigate the claim that time-triggered systems are immune against out-of-envelope behavior and how event-triggered systems can be constructed to defend against being overwhelmed by interrupt showers. We introduce importance (independently of priority and criticality) as a means to express which tasks should still be scheduled in case environmental design assumptions cease to hold, draw parallels to mixed-criticality scheduling, and demonstrate how event-triggered systems can defend against out-of-envelope behavior.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Rate of Stochastic Control Systems with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a quantitative framework for analyzing the mean-square exponential stabilization of stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise, focusing specifically on the optimal stabilizing rate, which characterizes the fastest exponential stabilization achievable under admissible control policies. 
Our contributions are twofold. First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>The Missing Variable: Socio-Technical Alignment in Risk Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in the risk assessment of AI-enabled safety-critical systems. While these systems, where AI systems assists human operators, function as complex socio-technical systems, existing risk evaluation methods fail to account for the associated complex interaction between human, technical, and organizational elements. Through a comparative analysis of system attributes from both socio-technical and AI-enabled systems and a review of current risk evaluation methods, we confirm the absence of socio-technical considerations in standard risk expressions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel socio-technical alignment $STA$ variable designed to be integrated into the foundational risk equation. This variable estimates the degree of harmonious interaction between the AI systems, human operators, and organizational processes. A case study on an AI-enabled liquid hydrogen bunkering system demonstrates the variable's relevance. By comparing a naive and a safeguarded system design, we illustrate how the $STA$-augmented expression captures socio-technical safety implications that traditional risk evaluation overlooks, providing a more holistic basis for risk evaluation.</description>

      <title>Demographic Dependence of Vaccine Adoption under Opinion Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by contagion models of social belief formation, we develop an epistemically-informed modeling framework, SIS-Vo, in which vaccine-related information propagates on a signed opinion network. Our model allows for heterogeneous treatment effects of policy messages across subpopulations through demographic-specific responses. We derive fixed-point characterizations of the healthy (disease-free) and endemic equilibria of this model, and obtain conditions for local stability of the healthy state in terms of the contact network and opinion-dependent vaccination capacities. Using numerical simulations, we illustrate how suitably targeted policy interventions, acting through opinion dynamics, can stabilize the epidemic process by moving the system towards the healthy regime. The SIS-Vo framework thus provides a natural basis for control-theoretic analysis of vaccination policies that remain robust even when misinformation targets specific subgroups.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes PH-based metrics for benchmarking impedance control. A causality-consistent PH model is introduced for mass-spring-damper impedance in Cartesian space. Based on this model, a differentiable, force-torque sensing-independent, n-DoF passivity condition is derived, valid for time-varying references. An impedance fidelity metric is also defined from step-response power in free motion, capturing dynamic decoupling. The proposed metrics are validated in Gazebo simulations with a six-DoF manipulator and a quadruped leg. Results demonstrate the suitability of the PH framework for standardized impedance control benchmarking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and solves a structural controllability problem for ensembles of switched linear systems. All individual subsystems in the ensemble are sparse, governed by the same sparsity pattern, and undergo switching at the same sequence of time instants. The controllability of an ensemble system describes the ability to use a common control input to simultaneously steer every individual system. A sparsity pattern is called structurally controllable for pair \((k,q)\) if it admits a controllable ensemble of \(q\) individual systems with at most \(k\) switches. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a sparsity pattern to be structurally controllable for a given \((k,q)\), and characterize when a sparsity pattern admits a finite \(k\) that guarantees structural controllability for \((k,q)\) for arbitrary $q$. Compared with the linear time-invariant ensemble case, this second condition is strictly weaker. We further show that these conditions have natural connections with maximum flow, and hence can be checked by polynomial algorithms. Specifically, the time complexity of deciding structural controllability is \(O(n^3)\) and the complexity of computing the smallest number of switches needed is \(O(n^3 \log n)\), with \(n\) the dimension of each individual subsystem.</description>

      <title>Model-Less Feedback Control of Space-based Continuum Manipulators using Backbone Tension Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum manipulators offer intrinsic dexterity and safe geometric compliance for navigation within confined and obstacle-rich environments. However, their infinite-dimensional backbone deformation, unmodeled internal friction, and configuration-dependent stiffness fundamentally limit the reliability of model-based kinematic formulations, resulting in inaccurate Jacobian predictions, artificial singularities, and unstable actuation behavior. Motivated by these limitations, this work presents a complete model-less control framework that bypasses kinematic modeling by using an empirically initialized Jacobian refined online through differential convex updates. Tip motion is generated via a real-time quadratic program that computes actuator increments while enforcing tendon slack avoidance and geometric limits. A backbone tension optimization term is introduced in this paper to regulate axial loading and suppress co-activation compression. The framework is validated across circular, pentagonal, and square trajectories, demonstrating smooth convergence, stable tension evolution, and sub-millimeter steady-state accuracy without any model calibration or parameter identification. These results establish the proposed controller as a scalable alternative to model-dependent continuum manipulation in a constrained environment.</description>

      <title>Control of Powered Ankle-Foot Prostheses on Compliant Terrain: A Quantitative Approach to Stability Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walking on compliant terrain presents a substantial challenge for individuals with lower-limb amputation, further elevating their already high risk of falling. While powered ankle-foot prostheses have demonstrated adaptability across speeds and rigid terrains, control strategies optimized for soft or compliant surfaces remain underexplored. This work experimentally validates an admittance-based control strategy that dynamically adjusts the quasi-stiffness of powered prostheses to enhance gait stability on compliant ground. Human subject experiments were conducted with three healthy individuals walking on two bilaterally compliant surfaces with ground stiffness values of 63 and 25 kN/m, representative of real-world soft environments. Controller performance was quantified using phase portraits and two walking stability metrics, offering a direct assessment of fall risk. Compared to a standard phase-variable controller developed for rigid terrain, the proposed admittance controller consistently improved gait stability across all compliant conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, stability-aware prosthesis control to reduce fall risk in real-world environments and advance the robustness of human-prosthesis interaction in rehabilitation robotics.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Composite Neural Architecture Search for Multi-Source RL State Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing state encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple information sources -- such as sensor measurements, time-series signals, image observations, and textual instructions -- remains underexplored and often requires manual design. We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.</description>

      <title>Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Surrogate compliance modeling enables reinforcement learned locomotion gaits for soft robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive morphogenetic robots adapt their morphology and control policies to meet changing tasks and environmental conditions. Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines. Field experiments with the robot further demonstrate stable, multi-gait locomotion across diverse natural terrains, including gravel, grass, and mud.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Lane-Changing Behavior in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and understanding lane-changing behavior in the presence of automated vehicles (AVs) is crucial to ensuring safety and efficiency in mixed traffic. Accordingly, this study aims to characterize the interactions between the lane-changing vehicle (active vehicle) and the vehicle directly impacted by the maneuver in the target lane (passive vehicle). Utilizing real-world trajectory data from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), this study explores patterns in lane-changing behavior and provides insight into how these behaviors evolve under different AV market penetration rates (MPRs). In particular, we propose a game-theoretic framework to analyze cooperative and defective behaviors in mixed traffic, applied to the 7,636 observed lane-changing events in the WOMD. First, we utilize k-means clustering to classify vehicles as cooperative or defective, revealing that the proportions of cooperative AVs are higher than those of HDVs in both active and passive roles. Next, we jointly estimate the utilities of active and passive vehicles to model their behaviors using the quantal response equilibrium framework. Empirical payoff tables are then constructed based on these utilities. Using these payoffs, we analyze the presence of social dilemmas and examine the evolution of cooperative behaviors using evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal the presence of social dilemmas in approximately 4% and 11% of lane-changing events for active and passive vehicles, respectively, with most classified as Stag Hunt or Prisoner's Dilemma (Chicken Game rarely observed). Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results show that repeated lane-changing interactions consistently lead to increased cooperative behavior over time, regardless of the AV penetration rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating autonomous mobile robots into human environments requires human-like decision-making and energy-efficient, event-based computation. Despite progress, neuromorphic methods are rarely applied to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) navigation approaches due to unstable training. We address this gap with a hybrid socially integrated DRL actor-critic approach that combines Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in the actor with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the critic and a neuromorphic feature extractor to capture temporal crowd dynamics and human-robot interactions. Our approach enhances social navigation performance and reduces estimated energy consumption by approximately 1.69 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Docking Between Autonomous Surface Vehicles with Disturbance Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) are a popular and efficient type of marine craft that find application in a large number of water-based tasks. When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model. This is particularly effective in case of almost-stationary disturbances such as water currents. In simulations, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for a faster and more efficient docking with respect to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Bimorph Lithium Niobate Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar PV, energy storage, and flexible loads, by a profit-seeking aggregator participating directly in the wholesale market under distribution network access constraints. We propose a competitive DER aggregator (DERA) model that directly controls local DERs to maximize its profits, while ensuring each aggregated customer gains a surplus higher than their surplus under the regulated retail tariff. The DERA participates in the wholesale electricity market as virtual storage with optimized generation offers and consumption bids derived from the propoed competitive aggregation model. Also derived are DERA's bid curves for the distribution network access and DERA's profitability when competing with the regulated retail tariff. We show that, with the same distribution network access, the proposed DERA's wholesale market participation achieves the same welfare-maximizing outcome as when its customers participate directly in the wholesale market. Extensive numerical studies compare the proposed DERA with existing methods in terms of customer surplus and DERA profit. We empirically evaluate how many DERAs can survive in the competition at long-run equilibrium, and assess the impacts of DER adoption levels and distribution network access on short-run operations.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Bounding Reachability Probabilities of Continuous-time Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an innovative framework for constructing barrier functions to bound reachability probabilities for continuous-time stochastic systems described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The reachability probabilities considered in this paper encompass two aspects: the probability of reaching a set of specified states within a predefined finite time horizon, and the probability of reaching a set of specified states at a particular time instant. The barrier functions presented in this manuscript are developed either by relaxing a parabolic partial differential equation that characterizes the exact reachability probability or by applying the Gr\"onwall's inequality. In comparison to the prevailing construction method, which relies on Doob's non-negative supermartingale inequality (or Ville's inequality), the proposed barrier functions provide stronger alternatives, complement existing methods, or fill gaps.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Signal Control of Interconnected Intersections: A Two-Lane Traffic Network Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate traffic signal control in a network of interconnected intersections, aiming to balance lane-level vehicle densities through optimal green-time allocation. We develop a two-lane traffic flow model that explicitly captures lane-specific propagation dynamics, addressing key limitations of conventional road-level formulations. The proposed model offers a more granular and flexible representation of urban traffic, enabling controllers to react more accurately to lane-specific congestion patterns. Building on this model, we design a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework and integrate it with the efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to enhance scalability and real-time performance. To accommodate time-varying traffic conditions, we further introduce a data-driven method for forecasting dynamic split ratios. Comprehensive VISSIM simulations on a six-intersection network in Dalian, China, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing signal control strategies in both traffic efficiency and computational speed, showing its promise for real-time deployment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $H$-property for step-graphons. Specifically, we sample graphs $G_n$ on $n$ nodes from a step-graphon and evaluate the probability that $G_n$ has a Hamiltonian decomposition in the asymptotic regime as $n\to\infty$. It has been shown that for almost all step-graphons, this probability converges to either zero or one. We focus in this paper on the residual case where the zero-one law does not apply. We show that the limit of the probability still exists and provide an explicit expression of it. We present a complete proof of the result and validate it through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}.

      <title>Collaborative Drill Alignment in Surgical Robotics</title>

Abstract: Robotic assistance allows surgeries to be reliably and accurately executed while still under direct supervision of the surgeon, combining the strengths of robotic technology with the surgeon's expertise. This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</description>

      <title>Iterative VCG-based Mechanism Fosters Cooperation in Multi-Regional Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transportation network design often involves multiple stakeholders with diverse priorities. We consider a system with a hierarchical multi-agent structure, featuring self-optimized subnetwork operators at the lower level and a central organization at the upper level. Independent regional planning can lead to inefficiencies due to the lack of coordination, hindering interregional travel and cross-border infrastructure development, while centralized methods may struggle to align local interests and can be impractical to implement. To support decision making for such a system, we introduce an iterative VCG-based mechanism for multi-regional network design that fosters cooperation among subnetwork operators. By leveraging the Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, the framework determines collective investment decisions and the necessary payments from both operators and the central organization to achieve efficient outcomes. A case study on the European Railway System validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in overall network performance through enhanced cross-region cooperation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Networks with Large and Small Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern sensing and monitoring applications typically consist of sources transmitting updates of different sizes, ranging from a few bytes (position, temperature, etc.) to multiple megabytes (images, video frames, LIDAR point scans, etc.). Existing approaches to wireless scheduling for information freshness typically ignore this mix of large and small updates, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless broadcast network with sources transmitting updates of different sizes to a base station over unreliable links. Some sources send large updates spanning many time slots while others send small updates spanning only a few time slots. Due to medium access constraints, only one source can transmit to the base station at any given time, thus requiring careful design of scheduling policies that takes the sizes of updates into account. First, we derive a lower bound on the achievable Age of Information (AoI) by any transmission scheduling policy. Second, we develop optimal randomized policies that consider both switching and no-switching during the transmission of large updates. Third, we introduce a novel Lyapunov function and associated analysis to propose an AoI-based Max-Weight policy that has provable constant factor optimality guarantees. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed scheduling policies through simulations, which show that our Max-Weight policy achieves near-optimal AoI performance.</description>

      <title>Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. We first demonstrate correctness and monotone refinement of guarantees for two subsystems. Then, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-horizon reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples and a nonlinear DC microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework on verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Observer Design for Networked Linear Systems with Fast and Slow Dynamics under Measurement Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for networked control systems (NCS) with linear plants that operate at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results on their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the information theory of lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems. Rate measures abstraction size, while distortion describes accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum achievable abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and the abstraction size; and vice-versa a lower bound on the minimum size, for given distortion. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through trajectory entropy. We demonstrate its tightness on some dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how this new theory enables constructing minimal abstractions, optimizing the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and stable state estimation is critical for battery management. Although dual Kalman filtering can jointly estimate states and parameters, the strong coupling between filters may cause divergence under large initialization errors or model mismatch. This paper proposes a Stability Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering (SG-DKF) method. A Lyapunov-based analysis yields a sufficient stability condition, leading to an adaptive dead-zone rule that suspends parameter updates when the innovation exceeds a stability bound. Applied to an electrochemical battery model, SG-DKF achieves accuracy comparable to a dual EKF and reduces state of charge RMSE by over 45% under large initial state errors.</description>

      <title>InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</description>

Abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally, researchers have relied on offboard perception systems, which are limited to expensive and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to autonomously grasp various objects in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our ROS 2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible to the broader research community.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we describe and demonstrate a novel Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) driven methodology to re-center room-temperature Process Design Kits (PDKs) for cryogenic operation using a limited set of experimental measurements. Unlike previous approaches that relied on direct fitting of sparse measurements, our technique accounts for process-induced deviations by calibrating TCAD models to both room-temperature and cryogenic data. Compact models for all process corners are extracted from TCAD-generated target characteristics, enabling accurate cryogenic modeling without dedicated foundry support. This scalable, technology-independent method provides a practical path for cryogenic circuit design.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture.
  To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <title>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Jointly Computation- and Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks. Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i) the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a classification task.</description>

      <title>Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Compensation for Safe Kinematic Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art.
