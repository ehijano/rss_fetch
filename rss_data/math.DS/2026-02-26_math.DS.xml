      <title>Towers and Bratteli-Vershik systems in Fibonacci-like unimodal maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of Fibonacci-like unimodal maps, the restriction to the $\omega$-limit set of the unique turning point defines a minimal Cantor system. We construct these Cantor sets geometrically using a nested sequence of finite covers with a tower structure. From this tower structure, we recover the associated Bratteli-Vershik model determined by the cutting times and obtain an explicit formula for the unique ergodic invariant probability measure supported on the $\omega$-limit set. We conclude with applications illustrating the scope of the construction.</description>

      <title>Kernel Methods for the Construction of Certified Lyapunov Functions via Approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kernel-based methodology for constructing Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems using approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Our approach decomposes principal Koopman eigenfunctions into linear and nonlinear components, where the linear part is obtained from the system's linearization and the nonlinear part is computed by solving a partial differential equation using symmetric kernel collocation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The resulting Lyapunov function is constructed as a quadratic form in the approximate eigenfunctions. We establish error bounds relating the approximation quality to the fill distance of collocation points and provide a certification procedure using continuous piecewise affine (CPA) methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark systems, including a polynomial system and the Duffing oscillator, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Symbols frequencies in the Thue--Morse word in base $3/2$ and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a binary Thue--Morse-type sequence arising from the base-$3/2$ expansion of integers, an archetypal automatic sequence in a rational base numeration system. Because the sequence is generated by a periodic iteration of morphisms rather than a single primitive substitution, classical Perron--Frobenius methods do not directly apply to determine symbol frequencies. We prove that both symbols ${\tt 0},{\tt 1}$ occur with frequency $1/2$ and we show uniform recurrence and symmetry properties of its set of factors. The proof reveals a structural bridge between combinatorics on words and harmonic analysis: the first difference sequence is shown to be Toeplitz, providing dynamical rigidity, while filtered frequencies naturally encode a dyadic structure that lifts to the compact group of $2$-adic integers. In this $2$-adic setting, desubstitution becomes a linear operator on Fourier coefficients, and a spectral contraction argument enforces uniqueness of limiting densities. Our results answer several conjectures of Dekking (on a sibling sequence) and illustrate how harmonic analysis on compact groups can be fruitfully combined with substitution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Target controllability for a minimum time problem in a trait-structured chemostat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a minimum time control problem governed by a trait-structured chemostat model including mutation and one limiting substrate. Our first main result proves the well-posedness of the control-to-state mapping. We subsequently analyze the class of auxostat-type controls, feedback laws designed to regulate substrate concentration, and prove that the corresponding solutions converge to a stationary state of the system. These convergence results are used to show the reachability of a target set corresponding to the selection of a population with a low weighted averaged half-saturation constant. Finally, we show the existence of an optimal control for the minimum time problem associated with reaching the target set. These theoretical findings are completed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Global Continuation of Stable Periodic Orbits in Systems of Competing Predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a continuation technique to obtain global families of stable periodic orbits, delimited by transcritical bifurcations at both ends. To this end, we formulate a zero-finding problem whose zeros correspond to families of periodic orbits. We then define a Newton-like fixed-point operator and establish its contraction near a numerically computed approximation of the family. To verify the contraction, we derive sufficient conditions expressed as inequalities on the norms of the fixed-point operator, and involving the numerical approximation. These inequalities are then rigorously checked by the computer via interval arithmetic. To show the efficacy of our approach, we prove the existence of global families in an ecosystem with Holling's type II functional response, and thereby solve a stable connection problem proposed by Butler and Waltler in 1981. Our method does not rely on restricting the choice of parameters and is applicable to many other systems that numerically exhibit global families.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measure of dominated planar self-affine sets with large dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff measure of planar dominated self-affine sets at their affinity dimension. We show that the Hausdorff measure being positive and finite is equivalent to the K\"aenm\"aki measure being a mass distribution. Moreover, under the open bounded neighbourhood condition, we will show that the positivity of the Hausdorff measure is equivalent to the projection of the K\"aenm\"aki measure in every Furstenberg direction being absolutely continuous with bounded density. This also implies that the affinity and the Assouad dimension coincide. We will also provide examples for both of the cases when the Hausdorff measure is zero and positive.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the block gluing classes of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A homshift is a $d$-dimensional shift of finite type which arises as the space of graph homomorphisms from the grid graph $\mathbb Z^d$ to a finite connected undirected graph $G$. While shifts of finite type are known to be mired by the swamp of undecidability, homshifts seem to be better behaved and there was hope that all the properties of homshifts are decidable. In this paper we build on the work by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha (arxiv:2211.04075) to show that finer mixing properties are undecidable for reasons completely different than the ones used to prove undecidability for general multidimensional shifts of finite type. Inspired by the work of Gao, Jackson, Krohne and Seward (arxiv:1803.03872) and elementary algebraic topology, we interpret the square cover introduced by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha topologically. Using this interpretation, we prove that it is undecidable whether a homshift is $\Theta(n)$-block gluing or not, by relating this problem to the one of finiteness for finitely presented groups.</description>

Abstract: We studied the transfer operators defined over $\mathbb{C}_p$-valued analytic functions for subhyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and showed that the corresponding Ruelle's zeta functions are meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We also used $\mathbb{R}$-valued transfer operators to study the shape of the corresponding Julia sets, and proved a Levin-Sodin-Yuditski type identity for general rational maps on $\mathbb{C}_p$. In all the results above, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be replaced with any non-Archimedean local field with characteristic $0$, and $\mathbb{C}_p$ the metric completion of its algebraic closure.</description>

Abstract: We construct geometrically infinite hyperbolic surfaces supporting horocycles with tailored recurrence properties. In particular, we obtain the first examples of non-trivial minimal horocyclic orbit closures and of infinite locally-finite conservative horocyclic invariant measures which are singular with respect to the geodesic flow. Other examples include surfaces supporting horocyclic orbit closures of arbitrary Hausdorff dimension in $(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for certain unipotent subgroups in quotients of perfect Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of perfect Lie groups with a polynomial error term. Even for semisimple quotients, our result provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution with polynomial error rate is obtained for non-horospherical unipotent subgroups.
  The proof is based on the spectral gap of the ambient space, an effective closing lemma, Bourgain's discretized projection theorem, and a sub-modularity inequality in irreducible representation. The sub-modularity inequality is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.
  As applications, we obtain effective estimates on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits of non-degenerate lacunary contact forms on prequantization bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-degenerate contact form is lacunary if the indexes of every contractible periodic Reeb orbit have the same parity. To the best of our knowledge, every contact form with finitely many periodic orbits known so far is non-degenerate and lacunary. We show that every non-degenerate lacunary contact form on a suitable prequantization of a closed symplectic manifold $B$ has precisely $r_B$ contractible closed orbits, where $r_B=\dim \mathrm{H}_*(B;{\mathbb Q})$. Examples of such prequantizations include the standard contact sphere, the unit cosphere bundle of a compact rank one symmetric space (CROSS) and many others. We also consider some prequantizations of orbifolds, like lens spaces and the unit cosphere bundle of lens spaces, and obtain multiplicity results for these prequantizations.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, it becomes necessary to solve the "Master equation", in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Species with Density-Dependent Interactions in a Mutualistic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space, and let $Q \subset X$ be countable. Given functions $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+$ and $\phi: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ that ``hit'' the shrinking balls $B({\xi},{\phi(R(\xi))})$ for infinitely many $\xi \in Q$, yet, for every $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, are eventually ``cleared out'' from the slightly smaller neighborhoods $B({\xi},{(1-\epsilon)\phi(R(\xi))})$, that is, they lie outside all but finitely many of these smaller balls.
  We give sufficient conditions (also necessary under mild assumptions) for $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to have infinite Hausdorff $f$-measure. This setting generalizes both the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of exactly $\psi$-approximable points (with $\psi$ non-increasing) and certain types of restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</description>

Abstract: We develop an ab initio approach to describe the statistical behavior of finite-size fluctuations in the deterministic Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. We obtain explicit expressions for the covariance function of fluctuations of the complex order parameter and determine the variance of its magnitude entirely in terms of the equation parameters. Our results rely on an explicit complex-valued formula for the solution of the Adler equation. We present analytical results for both the sub- and the super-critical case. Moreover, our framework does not require any prior knowledge about the structure of the partially synchronized state. We corroborate our results with numerical simulations of the full Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. The proposed methodology is sufficiently general such that it can be applied to other interacting particle systems.</description>
