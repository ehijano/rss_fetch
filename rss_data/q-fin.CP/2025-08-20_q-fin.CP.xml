      <title>AlphaX: An AI-Based Value Investing Strategy for the Brazilian Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future</description>

      <title>AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data, is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery, systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote reproducibility and community engagement.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Strategies for Pension Fund Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based framework for assessing and improving the performance of a pension fund management scheme. This framework is modular and allows the definition of customized performance metrics that are used to assess and iteratively improve asset and liability management policies. We illustrate our framework with a simple implementation that showcases the power of including adaptable features. We show that it is possible to dissipate longevity and volatility risks by permitting adaptability in asset allocation and payout levels. The numerical results show that by including a small amount of flexibility, there can be a substantial reduction in the cost to run the pension plan as well as a substantial decrease in the probability of defaulting.</description>

      <title>Portfolio construction using a sampling-based variational quantum scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient and effective construction of portfolios that adhere to real-world constraints is a challenging optimization task in finance. We investigate a concrete representation of the problem with a focus on design proposals of an Exchange Traded Fund. We evaluate the sampling-based CVaR Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), combined with a local-search post-processing, for solving problem instances that beyond a certain size become classically hard. We also propose a problem formulation that is suited for sampling-based VQA. Our utility-scale experiments on IBM Heron processors involve 109 qubits and up to 4200 gates, achieving a relative solution error of 0.49%. Results indicate that a combined quantum-classical workflow achieves better accuracy compared to purely classical local search, and that hard-to-simulate quantum circuits may lead to better convergence than simpler circuits. Our work paves the path to further explore portfolio construction with quantum computers.</description>
