      <title>HQSI: Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence -- A Case Study of Online Certificate Status Protocol Request Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to advance, various sectors, including industry, government, academia, and research, have increasingly focused on its future applications. With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error.</description>

      <title>From Hand-Crafted Metrics to Evolved Training-Free Performance Predictors for Neural Architecture Search via Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Spiking Neural Networks with Sparse Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network (ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and robustness against adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Networks for Multi-Agent Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex, decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN) leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare. This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing, evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning in Genetic Programming Guided Local Search for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.</description>

      <title>TDFormer: A Top-Down Attention-Controlled Spiking Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.</description>

      <title>CMA-ES with Radial Basis Function Surrogate for Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary optimization algorithms often face defects and limitations that complicate the evolution processes or even prevent them from reaching the global optimum. A notable constraint pertains to the considerable quantity of function evaluations required to achieve the intended solution. This concern assumes heightened significance when addressing costly optimization problems. However, recent research has shown that integrating machine learning methods, specifically surrogate models, with evolutionary optimization can enhance various aspects of these algorithms. Among the evolutionary algorithms, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is particularly favored. This preference is due to its use of Gaussian distribution for calculating evolution and its ability to adapt optimization parameters, which reduces the need for user intervention in adjusting initial parameters. In this research endeavor, we propose the adoption of surrogate models within the CMA-ES framework called CMA-SAO to develop an initial surrogate model that facilitates the adaptation of optimization parameters through the acquisition of pertinent information derived from the associated surrogate model. Empirical validation reveals that CMA-SAO algorithm markedly diminishes the number of function evaluations in comparison to prevailing algorithms, thereby providing a significant enhancement in operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics: A new generation of low power, low latency and small footprint optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations. This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the development and application of Nheuristics.</description>

      <title>Graph-Supported Dynamic Algorithm Configuration for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the energy depletion in wireless rechargeable sensor networks using bi-level metaheuristic charging schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing works.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Forward-Forward Learning through Representational Dimensionality Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for offline reactivation in recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However, the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which, in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization in noisy neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Neural Influence Estimator: Towards Real-time Solutions to Influence Blocking Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However, achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model called neural influence estimator (NIE) offline as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs, and then combine it with optimization algorithms to address IBM problems online. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems given a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same optimization quality. Moreover, given a one-minute limit, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Discovering novel 3D molecular structures that simultaneously satisfy multiple property targets remains a central challenge in materials and drug design. Although recent diffusion-based models can generate 3D conformations, they require expensive retraining for each new property or property-combination and lack flexibility in enforcing structural constraints. We introduce EGD (Evolutionary Guidance in Diffusion), a training-free framework that embeds evolutionary operators directly into the diffusion sampling process. By performing crossover on noise-perturbed samples and then denoising them with a pretrained Unconditional diffusion model, EGD seamlessly blends structural fragments and steers generation toward user-specified objectives without any additional model updates. On both single- and multi-target 3D conditional generation tasks-and on multi-objective optimization of quantum properties EGD outperforms state-of-the-art conditional diffusion methods in accuracy and runs up to five times faster per generation. In the single-objective optimization of protein ligands, EGD enables customized ligand generation. Moreover, EGD can embed arbitrary 3D fragments into the generated molecules while optimizing multiple conflicting properties in one unified process. This combination of efficiency, flexibility, and controllable structure makes EGD a powerful tool for rapid, guided exploration of chemical space.</description>

      <title>What is Cognitive Computing? An Architecture and State of The Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00882</link>

Abstract: Cognitive Computing (COC) aims to build highly cognitive machines with low computational resources that respond in real-time. However, scholarly literature shows varying research areas and various interpretations of COC. This calls for a cohesive architecture that delineates the nature of COC. We argue that if Herbert Simon considered the design science is the science of artificial, cognitive systems are the products of cognitive science or 'the newest science of the artificial'. Therefore, building a conceptual basis for COC is an essential step into prospective cognitive computing-based systems. This paper proposes an architecture of COC through analyzing the literature on COC using a myriad of statistical analysis methods. Then, we compare the statistical analysis results with previous qualitative analysis results to confirm our findings. The study also comprehensively surveys the recent research on COC to identify the state of the art and connect the advances in varied research disciplines in COC. The study found that there are three underlaying computing paradigms, Von-Neuman, Neuromorphic Engineering and Quantum Computing, that comprehensively complement the structure of cognitive computation. The research discuss possible applications and open research directions under the COC umbrella.</description>

      <title>Combining SNNs with Filtering for Efficient Neural Decoding in Implantable Brain-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is important to make implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI) wireless to increase patient comfort and safety, the trend of increased channel count in recent neural probes poses a challenge due to the concomitant increase in the data rate. Extracting information from raw data at the source by using edge computing is a promising solution to this problem, with integrated intention decoders providing the best compression ratio. Recent benchmarking efforts have shown recurrent neural networks to be the best solution. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) emerge as a promising solution for resource efficient neural decoding while Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks achieve the best accuracy. In this work, we show that combining traditional signal processing techniques, namely signal filtering, with SNNs improve their decoding performance significantly for regression tasks, closing the gap with LSTMs, at little added cost. Results with different filters are shown with Bessel filters providing best performance. Two block-bidirectional Bessel filters have been used--one for low latency and another for high accuracy. Adding the high accuracy variant of the Bessel filters to the output of ANN, SNN and variants provided statistically significant benefits with maximum gains of $\approx 5\%$ and $8\%$ in $R^2$ for two SNN topologies (SNN\_Streaming and SNN\_3D). Our work presents state of the art results for this dataset and paves the way for decoder-integrated-implants of the future.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>
