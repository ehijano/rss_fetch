      <title>Observation of a Synchro-betatron Instability in Fermilab Booster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In preparation for PIP-II, there has been interest in running the Fermilab Booster at a higher current more indicative of the PIP-II era operation. In July 2023, an experiment was performed to study collective instabilities over the transition crossing at the Fermilab Booster. Over the transition crossing, the synchrotron tune becomes small and synchro-betatron instabilities become possible. During the experiment, an intensity threshold was observed, above which a dipole instability with losses concentrated in the tail of the bunch. These losses are consistent with the Convective Instability.</description>

      <title>Ionization Profile Monitors for the IOTA Proton Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization profile monitors (IPMs) are widely used in accelerators for non-destructive and fast diagnostics of high energy particle beams. Two such monitors - one vertical and one horizontal - are being developed for installation in the IOTA storage ring at Fermilab. They will be used for turn-by-turn (microseconds scale) measurements of the 70 MeV/c IOTA proton beam sizes. In this paper we present the IPMs design (largely following the FNAL Booster IPMs which employ no external guiding magnetic fields), their mechanical, vacuum, and electric subsystems and DAQ, and discuss anticipated effects on the beams circulating in IOTA.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Electron Microbunching Rotation for Generating Isolated Attosecond Soft X-ray Free-electron Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond x-ray pulses play a crucial role in the study of ultrafast phenomena occurring within inner and valence electrons. Especially isolated attosecond pulses with high photon energy and high peak power are of great significance in single-shot imaging in the soft x-ray region, life sciences, and attosecond pump-probe experiments. In modern accelerators, laser manipulation of electrons can be used to tailor the ultrafast properties of free-electron laser (FEL) pulses. In this paper, we propose a novel laser manipulation technique that makes use of two laser beams with mutual delays and tilted wavefronts to synthesize microbunching rotation on the scale of infrared laser wavelengths within the electron bunch for generating isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses. This microbunching rotation ultimately leads to an enhanced current contrast ratio between the main peak and the surrounding satellite peaks within the bunch. By properly accounting for the longitudinal space charge fields within the FEL undulator, a tapered undulator can further suppress the side peaks in the radiation pulse and enable the selection of an isolated, hundred-attosecond, GW-level soft x-ray pulse.</description>

      <title>Fermilab Booster Beam Emittances from Quadrupole Modes Measured by BPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of beam emittances by extracting the quadrupole mode signal from a 4 plate beam position monitor (BPM) was published at least 40 years ago. Unfortunately, in practice, this method suffers from poor signal to noise ratio and requires a lot of tuning to extract out the emittances. In this paper, an improved method where multiple BPMs are used together with better mathematical analysis is described. The BPM derived emittances are then compared with those measured by the Ion Profile Monitor (IPM). Surprisingly, the BPM measured emittances behave very well and are more realistic than those measured by the IPM.</description>

      <title>What is Needed for BiSCO to Work in a Dipole Insert for 20 Tesla Hybrid Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major focus of the global HEP community is on high field superconducting magnets made of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) for future Energy Frontier Programs. Within the U.S. Magnet Development Program (US MDP), a key task is that of developing HTS inserts producing fields larger than 5 T within 15 T outserts made of Nb$_3$Sn to generate 20 T+ for future accelerators. Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$$_-$$_x$ (BiSCO) is the only high T c superconductor available as an isotropic round multifilamentary wire, which is ideal for producing the flat cables (i.e., Rutherford type cables) that are used in accelerator magnets. Significant progress in the development and industrialization of BiSCO wires has been made over the last decade. However, several challenges remain for this HTS to be used successfully in hybrid magnets. The following is required to improve performance, lower costs and simplify the processing of BiSCO accelerator magnets: (1) The development and design, in collaboration with industry, of BiSCO wires that are adequate for Rutherford cabling; (2) The development of insulation processes and materials that prevent leaks when heat treated in highly corrosive oxygen; (3) Control of stresses and strains; and (4) Integration of high pressure heat treatment with a new approach that will lower costs and simplify processing.</description>
