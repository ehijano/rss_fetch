      <title>ALAS: Transactional and Dynamic Multi-Agent LLM Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models enable flexible multi-agent planning but remain fragile in practice: verification is often circular, state changes are not tracked for repair, and small faults trigger costly global recomputation. We present ALAS, a stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from non-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks and restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in progress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh, bounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The repair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies (retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards) defined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo Workflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical benchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent baselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running 1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows that the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and that localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius and less makespan degradation than global recompute. Results indicate that the combination of validator isolation, versioned execution logs, and localized repair provides measurable efficiency, feasibility, and scalability for multi-agent LLM planning. Code and seeds will be released.</description>

      <title>Learning Communication Skills in Multi-task Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03348v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can communicate with one another to perform a task in a coordinated manner. When multiple tasks are involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve learning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs multiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable communication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode task-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared communication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we introduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of sender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments to multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation and action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS achieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without communication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without communication.</description>

      <title>AI Agents with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based AI agents still lack the technical means to automatically build nuanced and differentiated trust in other agents at the beginning of an agent-to-agent dialogue. But autonomous and interoperable trust establishing becomes a fundamental prerequisite once agents start to operate beyond isolated environments and engage in dialogues across individual or organizational boundaries. A promising way to fill this gap in Agentic AI is to equip agents with long-lived digital identities and introduce tamper-proof and flexible identity-bound attestations of agents, provisioned by commonly trusted third parties and designed for cross-domain verifiability. This article presents a conceptual framework and a prototypical multi-agent system, where each agent is endowed with a self-sovereign digital identity. It combines a unique and ledger-anchored Decentralized Identifier (DID) of an agent with a set of third-party issued Verifiable Credentials (VCs). This enables agents at the start of a dialog to prove ownership of their self-controlled DIDs for authentication purposes and to establish various cross-domain trust relationships through the spontaneous exchange of their self-hosted DID-bound VCs. A comprehensive evaluation of the prototypical implementation demonstrates technical feasibility but also reveals limitations once an agent's LLM is in sole charge to control the respective security procedures.</description>

      <title>Scaling Multi-Agent Environment Co-Design with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03179v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</description>

      <title>Characterising Global Platforms: Centralised, Decentralised, Federated, and Grassroots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03286v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global digital platforms are software systems designed to serve entire populations, with some already serving billions of people. We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes:
  1. Centralised -- one (the server)
  2. Decentralised -- finite $&gt;1$ (bootstrap nodes)
  3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers)
  4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents)
  Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they all satisfy the same basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol. It thus provides a unifying mathematical approach for the study of global digital platforms, perhaps the most important class of computer systems today.</description>

      <title>Inter-Agent Trust Models: A Comparative Study of Brief, Claim, Proof, Stake, Reputation and Constraint in Agentic Web Protocol Design-A2A, AP2, ERC-8004, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the "agentic web" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot searching with limited sensing range for static and mobile intruders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard, even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search. Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected orthogonal search area.</description>

      <title>Outbidding and Outbluffing Elite Humans: Mastering Liar's Poker via Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single Pass, Looping Through Time: KG-IRAG with Iterative Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</description>

      <title>Divide by Question, Conquer by Agent: SPLIT-RAG with Question-Driven Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.
