      <title>Robustness of Delayed Higher Order Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the feasibility of recently developed higher order delayed sliding mode controllers is addressed. With this aim the robustness against the measurement noise and mismatched perturbations for the systems governed by such controllers is established using ISS implicit Lyapunov-Razumikhin function approach. To illustrate proposed results, a simulation example validating the efficiency of the method is provided.</description>

      <title>Review of Power Electronic Solutions for Dielectric Barrier Discharge Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power supply topologies, aiming to bridge the gap between DBD applications and power electronics design. Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories of power supplies: sinusoidal types comprising transformerless and transformer-based resonant inverters, and pulsed power supplies (PPSs). The review summarizes performance trade-offs, highlights untested topologies and emerging applications, and offers guidance for advancing high-performance DBD power supply design for next-generation systems.</description>

      <title>A Games-in-Games Paradigm for Strategic Hybrid Jump-Diffusions: Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs Hierarchy and Spectral Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hierarchical games-in-games control architecture for hybrid stochastic systems governed by regime-switching jump-diffusions. We model the interplay between continuous state dynamics and discrete mode transitions as a bilevel differential game: an inner layer solves a robust stochastic control problem within each regime, while a strategic outer layer modulates the transition intensities of the underlying Markov chain. A Dynkin-based analysis yields a system of coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. We prove that for the class of Linear-Quadratic games and Exponential-Affine games, this hierarchy admits tractable semi-closed form solutions via coupled matrix differential equations. We prove that for the class of Linear-Quadratic games and Exponential-Affine games, this hierarchy admits tractable semi-closed form solutions via coupled matrix differential equations. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on adversarial market microstructure, showing how the outer layer's strategic switching pre-emptively adjusts inventory spreads against latent regime risks, which leads to a hyper-alert equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Timing-Aware Two-Player Stochastic Games with Self-Triggered Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-triggered two-player stochastic games on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) where each agent decides when to observe and which open-loop action to hold. Augmenting the state with clocks and committed controls yields flow regions (both hold) and trigger surfaces (at least one updates). The framework covers both blind simultaneous (Nash) timing and observable sequential (Stackelberg) commitments; the former leads to coupled, intractable QVIs, while the latter admits a nested Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality and a tractable dynamic-programming decomposition. We outline a computational scheme based on implicit differentiation of the follower's fixed point. A pursuit-evasion example illustrates the strategic timing interaction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Holonic Systems: Equilibrium, Uniqueness, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of modeling and control in hierarchical, multi-agent systems, known as holonic systems, where local agent decisions are coupled with global systemic outcomes. We introduce the Bayesian Holonic Equilibrium (BHE), a concept that ensures consistency between agent-level rationality and system-wide emergent behavior. We establish the theoretical soundness of the BHE by showing its existence and, under stronger regularity conditions, its uniqueness. We propose a two-time scale learning algorithm to compute such an equilibrium. This algorithm mirrors the system's structure, with a fast timescale for intra-holon strategy coordination and a slow timescale for inter-holon belief adaptation about external risks. The convergence of the algorithm to the theoretical equilibrium is validated through a numerical experiment on a continuous public good game. This work provides a complete theoretical and algorithmic framework for the principled design and analysis of strategic risk in complex, coupled control systems.</description>

      <title>Regularized Distributed MPC for UAV Networks: Stabilizing Coupled Motion and Hybrid Beam Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the coupled control problem in UAV networks utilizing high-frequency hybrid beamsteering. While phased arrays enable rapid electronic scanning, their finite Field of View (FoV) imposes a fundamental constraint that necessitates active mechanical steering of the airframe to maintain connectivity. We propose a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that jointly optimizes trajectory and heading to maximize network sum-capacity subject to safety constraints. Addressing the numerical instability caused by fast-fading channel nulls, we introduce a regularized surrogate cost function based on discrete spatial smoothing. We analytically prove that this approximation bounds the cost curvature, restoring the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Crucially, we derive a sufficient condition linking this Lipschitz constant to the controller gain, guaranteeing the contraction and linear convergence of the distributed best-response dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively navigates the trade-off between electronic beam tracking and kinematic safety, significantly systematically outperforming velocity-aligned baselines.</description>

      <title>Power Converter DC Link Ripple and Network Unbalance as Active Constraints in Distribution System Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mitigation of unbalanced grid voltages or currents by voltage source converters results in power ripple on the dc link, and is a key converter design parameter due to hardware or stability considerations. Despite the importance of this issue for system design and operation, the use of Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based methods capturing the interaction between dc link ripple and converter unbalanced operation has been largely unexplored. In this work, the magnitude of the power ripple is derived for generic multi-terminal converters, then introduced as a bilinear OPF constraint for two-level converter topologies. OPF case studies demonstrate the necessity to model both neutral current and dc link ripple, with tradeoffs between capacitor sizing and leg sizing highlighted for phase current unbalance mitigation applications. Time domain simulations of a grid-connected four-wire voltage source converter verify the accuracy and validity of the algebraic formulation. It is concluded that awareness of dc link ripple impacts and constraints will be of growing importance for distribution system operators.</description>

      <title>State-Space Averaging Revisited via Reconstruction Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an operator-theoretic reconstruction of an equivalent continuous-time LTI model from an exact sampled-data (Poincar\'e-map) baseline of a piecewise-linear switching system. The rebuilding is explicitly expressed via matrix logarithms. By expanding the logarithm of a product of matrix exponentials using the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) formula, we show that the classical state-space averaging (SSA) model can be interpreted as the leading-order truncation of this exact reconstruction when the switching period is small and the ripple is small. The same view explains why SSA critically relies on low-frequency and small-ripple assumptions, and why the method becomes fragile for converters with more than two subintervals per cycle. Finally, we provide a complexity-reduced, SSA-flavoured implementation strategy for obtaining the required spectral quantities and a real-valued logarithm without explicitly calling eigen-decomposition or complex matrix logarithms, by exploiting $2\times 2$ invariants and a minimal real-lift construction.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control under stochastic requirements: minimizing conditional value-at-risk instead of worst-case performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional robust $\mathcal H_2/\mathcal H_\infty$ control minimizes the worst-case performance, often leading to a conservative design driven by very rare and somewhat arbitrary parametric configurations. To reduce this conservatism while taking advantage of the stochastic properties of Monte-Carlo sampling and its compatibility with parallel computing, we introduce an alternative paradigm that optimizes the controller with respect to a stochastic criterion, namely the conditional value at risk. We illustrate the potential of this approach on a realistic satellite benchmark, showing that it can significantly improve overall performance by tolerating some degradation in very rare worst-case scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Proofs for Sound Verification and Control of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.</description>

      <title>Virtual Resistance-Based Control for Grid-Connected Inverters using Persidskii Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses virtual resistance (VR)based control for grid-connected inverters, which enhances transient damping, reduces steady-state errors, and improves robustness to grid disturbances without requiring additional voltage sensors. Classical passivity-based VR control is robust, but limited by restrictive sector bounds on nonlinearities. We extend these bounds and model the closed-loop system as a generalized Persidskii-type nonlinear system. Using this framework, we derive input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions that account for the extended nonlinearities and external disturbances, providing a systematic and less conservative approach to VR control design under practical operating conditions, which is validated through extensive simulations.</description>

Abstract: This paper study the hyperexponential stabilization for infinite-dimensional system on Hilbert space by a distributed time depending control law. The well-posedness of the closed loop for every time is obtained through the use of maximal monotone operator.

      <title>A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</description>

      <title>Sink Proximity: A Novel Approach for Online Vehicle Dispatch in Ride-hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms have a profound impact on urban transportation systems, and their performance largely depends on how intelligently they dispatch vehicles in real time. In this work, we develop a new approach to online vehicle dispatch that strengthens a platform's ability to serve more requests under demand uncertainty. We introduce a novel measure called sink proximity, a network-science-inspired measure that captures how demand and vehicle flows are likely to evolve across the city. By integrating this measure into a shareability-network framework, we design an online dispatch algorithm that naturally considers future network states, without depending on fragile spatiotemporal forecasts. Numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly improves the request service rate under peak hours within a receding horizon framework with limited future information available.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Stability: Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Control of Networked Systems in the Space of Stabilizing Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed control of networked systems through reinforcement learning, where neural policies must be simultaneously scalable, expressive and stabilizing. We introduce a policy parameterization that embeds Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into a Youla-like magnitude-direction parameterization, yielding distributed stochastic controllers that guarantee network-level closed-loop stability by design. The magnitude is implemented as a stable operator consisting of a GNN acting on disturbance feedback, while the direction is a GNN acting on local observations. We prove robustness of the closed loop to perturbations in both the graph topology and model parameters, and show how to integrate our parameterization with Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments on a multi-agent navigation task show that policies trained on small networks transfer directly to larger ones and unseen network topologies, achieve higher returns and lower variance than a state-of-the-art MARL baseline while preserving stability.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Traffic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based traffic signal control is typically optimized for average performance under a few nominal demand patterns, which can result in poor behavior under atypical traffic conditions. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for signal control on a 3x3 urban grid calibrated from a contiguous 3x3 subarea of central Athens covered by the pNEUMA trajectory dataset (Barmpounakis and Geroliminis, 2020). Our approach proceeds in three stages. First, we train a baseline multi-agent RL controller in which each intersection is governed by a proximal policy optimization agent with discrete signal phases, using a centralized training, decentralized execution paradigm. Second, to capture demand uncertainty, we construct eight heterogeneous origin-destination-based traffic scenarios-one directly derived from pNEUMA and seven synthetically generated-to span a wide range of spatial and temporal demand patterns. Over this scenario set, we train a contextual-bandit worst-case estimator that assigns mixture weights to estimate adversarial demand distributions conditioned on context. Finally, without modifying the controller architecture, we fine-tune the baseline multi-agent reinforcement learning agents under these estimated worst-case mixtures to obtain a distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning controller. Across all eight scenarios, as well as on an unseen validation network based on the Sioux Falls configuration, the distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning controller consistently reduces horizon-averaged queues and increases average speeds relative to the baseline, achieving up to 51% shorter queues and 38% higher speeds on the worst-performing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Smart nudging for efficient routing through networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the design of efficient digitalised deposit return schemes as a control problem. We focus on the recycling of paper cups, though the proposed methodology applies more broadly to reverse logistics systems arising in circular economy R-strategies. Each item is assumed to carry a digital wallet through which monetary rewards are allocated to actors transferring the item across successive stages, incentivising completion of the recycling process. System efficiency is ensured by: (i) decentralised algorithms that avoid congestion at individual nodes; (ii) a decentralised AIMD-based algorithm that optimally splits the deposit across layers; and (iii) a feedback control loop that dynamically adjusts the deposit to achieve a desired throughput. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations using realistic paper cup recycling data.</description>

      <title>Distribution Network Restoration with Mobile Resources Dispatch: A Simulation-Based Online Dynamic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispatching mobile resources such as repair crews and mobile emergency generators is essential for the rapid restoration of distribution systems after extreme events. However, the restoration process is affected by various uncertain factors including repair time, road condition, and newly observed failures, necessitating online decision-making in response to real-time information. This paper proposes a simulation-based online dynamic programming approach to provide real-time restoration actions considering the dispatch of mobile resources. Using an index-based priority rule as the base policy, the remaining cumulative loss at the current state and a given action is evaluated from online simulation. As the base policy is explicit, the simulation is efficient. Then, the action leading to the minimum cumulative loss is chosen. It is proven that such a strategy improves the performance of base policy. The proposed policy adapts to real-time information updates and does not rely on offline training, so incurs no data and convergence-related issues, which is important in restoration tasks where the historical data of extreme events is rare. The rolling optimization approach may not meet the requirement of online use, because routing mobile resources gives rise to large-scale discrete optimization problems. Case studies on 123-bus and 8500-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency and better performance compared with rolling horizon optimization.</description>

      <title>Rapid stabilization of the heat equation with localized disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the rapid stabilization of a multidimensional heat equation in the presence of an unknown spatially localized disturbance. A novel multivalued feedback control strategy is proposed, which synthesizes the frequency Lyapunov method (introduced by Xiang [41]) with the sign multivalued operator. This methodology connects Lyapunov-based stability analysis with spectral inequalities, while the inclusion of the sign operator ensures robustness against the disturbance. The closed-loop system is governed by a differential inclusion, for which well-posedness is proved via the theory of maximal monotone operators. This approach not only guarantees exponential stabilization but also circumvents the need for explicit disturbance modeling or estimation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed Communication-Sensing-Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints.</description>

      <title>Modular Landfill Remediation for AI Grid Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising AI electricity demand and persistent landfill methane emissions constitute coupled constraints on U.S. digital infrastructure and decarbonization. While China has achieved a rapid 'de-landfilling' transition through centralized coordination, the U.S. remains structurally 'locked in' to landfilling due to fragmented governance and carbon accounting incentives. This paper proposes a modular legacy landfill remediation framework to address these dual challenges within U.S. institutional constraints. By treating legacy sites as stock resources, the proposed system integrates excavation, screening, and behind-the-meter combined heat and power (CHP) to transform environmental liabilities into resilience assets. A system analysis of a representative AI corridor demonstrates that such modules can mitigate site-level methane by 60-70% and recover urban land, while supplying approximately 20 MW of firm, islandable power. Although contributing only approximately 5% of a hyperscale data center's bulk load, it provides critical microgrid resilience and black-start capability. We conclude that remediation-oriented waste-to-energy should be valued not as a substitute for bulk renewables, but as a strategic control volume for buffering critical loads against grid volatility while resolving long-term environmental liabilities.</description>

      <title>Vision-Aided Relative State Estimation for Approach and Landing on a Moving Platform with Inertial Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative position, orientation, and velocity between a UAV and a planar platform undergoing arbitrary 3D motion during approach and landing. The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Topology-based Conditions for Multiconsensus under the Signed Friedkin-Johnsen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the multiconsensus problem in networked systems, where agents are partitioned into disjoint subgroups and the states of agents within a subgroup are driven to consensus. Our objective is to present a distributed control law that leads to multiconsensus in signed digraphs. To this end, we examine the convergence of opinions under the opposing rule-based signed Friedkin-Johnsen (SFJ) model and present conditions that lead to multiconsensus under this model. Interestingly, the proposed conditions depend only on graph topology and signed interactions and not on the edge weights of the network. Consequently, the proposed SFJ-based control law relaxes the in-degree balance and homogeneity of trust-distrust, frequently assumed in the literature. Finally, we add simulation results to demonstrate the proposed conditions for multiconsensus.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of a B-Spline Deep Neural Operator for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability properties of neural operators through the structured representation offered by the Hybrid B-spline Deep Neural Operator (HBDNO). While existing stability-aware architectures typically enforce restrictive constraints that limit universality, HBDNO preserves full expressive power by representing outputs via B-spline control points. We show that these control points form a natural observable for post-training stability analysis. By applying Dynamic Mode Decomposition and connecting the resulting discrete dynamics to the Koopman operator framework, we provide a principled approach to spectral characterization of learned operators. Numerical results demonstrate the ability to assess stability and reveal future directions for safety-critical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a control strategy for sun trackers which adapts continuously to different sources of error, avoiding the necessity of any kind of calibration by analyzing the produced electric power to sense the position of the Sun. The proposed strategy is able to meet the strict specifications for HCPV sun trackers despite of mechanical uncertainties (misalignments in the structure itself, misalignment of the solar modules with respect to the wing, etc.) and installation uncertainties (misalignments of the platform with respect to geographical north). Experimental results with an industrial-grade solar tracker showing the validity of the proposed control strategy under sunny and moderate cloudy conditions, as well as with different installation precisions by un-calibrating the system on purpose are exposed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Analytical-Machine Learning Framework for Ripple Factor Estimation in Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Multipliers with Residual Correction for Non-Ideal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cockcroft-Walton (CW) voltage multipliers suffer from output ripple that classical analytical models underestimate due to neglected non-idealities like diode drops and capacitor ESR, particularly in high-stage, low-frequency and heavy-load regimes. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that generates a comprehensive 324-case MATLAB/Simulink dataset varying stages (2-8), input voltage (5-25 kV), capacitance (1-10 {\mu}F), frequency (50-500 Hz) and load (6-60 M{\Omega}), then trains a Random Forest model to predict residuals between simulated and theoretical peak-to-peak ripple. The approach achieves 70.6% RMSE reduction (131 V vs. 448 V) globally and 66.7% in critical regimes, with near-zero bias, enabling physically interpretable design optimization while outperforming pure ML in extrapolation reliability.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Newton-Induced Structure-Exploiting Algorithm for Differentiable Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable optimal control, particularly differentiable nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), provides a powerful framework that enjoys the complementary benefits of machine learning and control theory. A key enabler of differentiable optimal control is the computation of derivatives of the optimal trajectory with respect to problem parameters, i.e., trajectory derivatives. Previous works compute trajectory derivatives by solving a differential Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, and achieve this efficiently by constructing an equivalent auxiliary system. However, we find that directly exploiting the matrix structures in the differential KKT system yields significant computation speed improvements. Motivated by this insight, we propose FastDOC, which applies a Gauss-Newton approximation of Hessian and takes advantage of the resulting block-sparsity and positive semidefinite properties of the matrices involved. These structural properties enable us to accelerate the computationally expensive matrix factorization steps, resulting in a factor-of-two speedup in theoretical computational complexity, and in a synthetic benchmark FastDOC achieves up to a 180% time reduction compared to the baseline method. Finally, we validate the method on an imitation learning task for human-like autonomous driving, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FastDOC in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Exact Recourse Functions for Aggregations of EVs Operating in Imbalance Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal charging of large electric vehicle populations that are exposed to a single real-time imbalance price. The problem is naturally cast as a multistage stochastic linear programme (MSLP), which can be solved by algorithms such as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming. However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work.</description>

      <title>Optimal-coupling-observer AV motion control securing comfort in the presence of cyber attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in traffic safety. Methods have been published and evaluated in experimental vehicles to secure safe AV control in the presence of attacks, but human motion comfort is rarely investigated in such studies.
  In this paper, we present an innovative optimal-coupling-observer-based framework that rejects the impact of bounded sensor attacks in a network of connected and automated vehicles from safety and comfort point of view.
  We demonstrate its performance in car following with cooperative adaptive cruise control for platoons with redundant distance and velocity sensors.
  The error dynamics are formulated as a Linear Time Variant (LTV) system, resulting in complex stability conditions that are investigated using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach guaranteeing global asymptotic stability.
  We prove the capability of the framework to secure occupants' safety and comfort in the presence of bounded attacks. In the onset of attack, the framework rapidly detects attacked sensors and switches to the most reliable observer eliminating attacked sensors, even with modest attack magnitudes. Without our proposed method, severe (but bounded) attacks result in collisions and major discomfort. With our method, attacks had negligible effects on motion comfort evaluated using ISO-2631 Ride Comfort and Motion Sickness indexes. The results pave the path to bring comfort to the forefront of AVs security.</description>

      <title>FedWiLoc: Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving WiFi Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current data-driven Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems face three critical challenges: protecting user privacy, achieving accurate predictions in dynamic multipath environments, and generalizing across different deployments. Traditional Wi-Fi localization systems often compromise user privacy, particularly when facing compromised access points (APs) or man-in-the-middle attacks. As IoT devices proliferate in indoor environments, developing solutions that deliver accurate localization while robustly protecting privacy has become imperative. We introduce FedWiLoc, a privacy-preserving indoor localization system that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, FedWiLoc employs a split architecture where APs process Channel State Information (CSI) locally and transmit only privacy-preserving embedding vectors to user devices, preventing raw CSI exposure. Second, during training, FedWiLoc uses federated learning to collaboratively train the model across APs without centralizing sensitive user data. Third, we introduce a geometric loss function that jointly optimizes angle-of-arrival predictions and location estimates, enforcing geometric consistency to improve accuracy in challenging multipath conditions. Extensive evaluation across six diverse indoor environments spanning over 2,000 sq. ft. demonstrates that FedWiLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 61.9% in median localization error while maintaining strong privacy guarantees throughout both training and inference.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy and Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Energy-Efficient Process Control: A Use Case in Industrial Compressed Air Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy reinforcement learning approach for the control of industrial compressed air systems. We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\,\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.</description>

      <title>Why Most Optimism Bandit Algorithms Have the Same Regret Analysis: A Simple Unifying Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms -- including UCB, UCB-V, linear UCB, and finite-arm GP-UCB -- achieve logarithmic regret using proofs that, despite superficial differences, follow essentially the same structure. This note isolates the minimal ingredients behind these analyses: a single high-probability concentration condition on the estimators, after which logarithmic regret follows from two short deterministic lemmas describing radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations. The framework yields unified, near-minimal proofs for these classical algorithms and extends naturally to many contemporary bandit variants.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Constraints in Optimization-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide theoretical foundations and computational tools for the systematic design of optimization-based control laws with constraints that have different priorities. By introducing the concept of prioritized intersections, we extend and unify previous work on the topic. Moreover, to enable the use of prioritized intersection in real-time applications, we propose an efficient solver for forming such intersections for polyhedral constraints. The solver in question is a tailored implementation of a dual active-set quadratic programming solver that leverages the particular problem structure of the optimization problems arising for prioritized intersections. The method is validated in a real-time MPC application for autonomous driving, where it successfully resolves six different levels of conflicting constraints, confirming its efficiency and practicality for control. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solver outperforms existing solvers for hierarchical quadratic programming, making it relevant beyond control applications.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Consistency: Selection-Induced Bias in Gated Kalman Innovation Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.</description>

      <title>Comparing Dynamical Models Through Diffeomorphic Vector Field Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Correlated Markovian Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary.</description>

      <title>OPBO: Order-Preserving Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective method for solving expensive black-box optimization problems. Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

      <title>Optical design and characterization of a multi-depth vision simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample guarantees for data-driven forward-backward operator methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish finite sample certificates on the quality of solutions produced by data-based forward-backward (FB) operator splitting schemes. As frequently happens in stochastic regimes, we consider the problem of finding a zero of the sum of two operators, where one is either unavailable in closed form or computationally expensive to evaluate, and shall therefore be approximated using a finite number of noisy oracle samples. Under the lens of algorithmic stability, we then derive probabilistic bounds on the distance between a true zero and the FB output without making specific assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We show that under weaker conditions ensuring the convergence of FB schemes, stability bounds grow proportionally to the number of iterations. Conversely, stronger assumptions yield stability guarantees that are independent of the iteration count. We then specialize our results to a popular FB stochastic Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and validate our theoretical bounds on a control problem for smart grids, where the energy price uncertainty is approximated by means of historical data.</description>

      <title>Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning of Temperature-dependent Chemical Kinetics Using Parallel Droplet Microreactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature is a fundamental regulator of chemical and biochemical kinetics, yet capturing nonlinear thermal effects directly from experimental data remains a major challenge due to limited throughput and model flexibility. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled flexible modeling beyond conventional physical laws, but most existing strategies remain confined to surrogate models of end-point yields rather than full kinetic dynamics. Consequently, an end-to-end framework that unifies systematic kinetic data acquisition with machine learning based modeling has been lacking. In this paper, we present a unified framework that integrates droplet microfluidics with machine learning for the systematic analysis of temperature-dependent reaction kinetics. The platform is specifically designed to enable stable immobilization and long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of droplets under dynamic thermal gradients. This configuration yields massively parallel time-resolved datasets across diverse temperature conditions that capture transient kinetics and provides particularly suitable inputs for training machine-learning models of reaction dynamics. Leveraging these datasets, we train Neural ODE models, which embed neural networks within differential equations to flexibly represent nonlinear temperature dependencies beyond conventional formulations. We demonstrate accurate prediction of enzymatic kinetics across diverse thermal environments, highlighting the robustness and versatility of the approach. Our framework bridges high-throughput experimental data acquisition with data-driven modeling, establishing a versatile foundation for enhanced predictive ability and rational analysis and design of temperature-sensitive biochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description>

Abstract: The development of control methods based on data has seen a surge of interest in recent years. When applying data-driven controllers in real-world applications, providing theoretical guarantees for the closed-loop system is of crucial importance to ensure reliable operation. In this review, we provide an overview of data-driven model predictive control (MPC) methods for controlling unknown systems with guarantees on systems-theoretic properties such as stability, robustness, and constraint satisfaction. The considered approaches rely on the Fundamental Lemma from behavioral theory in order to predict input-output trajectories directly from data. We cover various setups, ranging from linear systems and noise-free data to more realistic formulations with noise and nonlinearities, and we provide an overview of different techniques to ensure guarantees for the closed-loop system. Moreover, we discuss avenues for future research that may further improve the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of data-driven MPC.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications (extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonconvex Reachability Analysis using Exact Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in data-driven reachability analysis: accurately representing and propagating non-convex reachable sets. We propose a novel approach using constrained polynomial zonotopes to describe reachable sets for unknown LTI systems. Unlike constrained zonotopes commonly used in existing literature, constrained polynomial zonotopes are closed under multiplication with constrained matrix zonotopes. We leverage this property to develop an exact multiplication method that preserves the non-convex geometry of reachable sets without resorting to approximations. We demonstrate that our approach provides tighter over-approximations of reachable sets for LTI systems compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is a powerful tool in modeling multi-agent interactions and human-robot systems. In practice, since the objective functions of both agents may not be explicitly known to each other, these interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games. Solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (ILQ) approximation of dynamic games, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions and updating its own control policy accordingly in real time, which leads to unbiased and fast learning of the unknown objective function of the peer agent. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables intent communication by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics. Finally, we show how N-PACE outperforms baseline methods that disregard the learning behavior of the other agent, both analytically and using our case studies</description>

      <title>Neural Controller for Incremental Stability of Unknown Continuous-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on synthesizing a controller that guarantees an unknown continuous-time system to be incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this context, the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF) for the continuous-time system is introduced. Combined with the controller, the $\delta$-ISS-CLF guarantees that the system is incrementally stable. As the paper deals with unknown dynamical systems, the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF are parametrized using neural networks. The data set used to train the neural networks is generated from the state space of the system by proper sampling. Now, to give a formal guarantee that the controller makes the system incrementally stable, we develop a validity condition by having some Lipschitz continuity assumptions and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies: a scalar system with a non-affine, non-polynomial structure, a one-link manipulator system, a nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of a jet engine, a magnetic levitator system and a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</description>

      <title>BattBee: Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Early Detection of Thermal Runaway Triggered by Internal Short Circuits for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the enabling power source for transportation electrification. However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway (TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper. First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk management.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop Inside Neural Networks: Causality-Guided Layer Adaptation for Fault Recovery Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of real-time fault recovery control for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to actuator loss of effectiveness faults and external disturbances. We derive a two-stage framework that combines causal inference with selective online adaptation to achieve an effective learning-based recovery control method. In the offline phase, we develop a causal layer attribution technique based on the average causal effect (ACE) to evaluate the relative importance of each layer in a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) controller compensating for faults. This methodology identifies a subset of high-impact layers responsible for robust fault compensation. In the online phase, we deploy a Lyapunov-based gradient update to adapt only the ACE-selected layer to circumvent the need for full-network or last-layer only updates. The proposed adaptive controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) with exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances. Compared to conventional adaptive DNN controllers with full-network adaptation, our methodology has a reduced computational overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, a case study is provided on a 3-axis attitude control system of a spacecraft with four reaction wheels.</description>

      <title>Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC for Periodic Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic operation often emerges as the economically optimal mode in industrial processes, particularly under varying economic or environmental conditions. This paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain systems modeled as polytopic linear differential inclusions (LDIs), where the dynamics evolve as convex combinations of finitely many affine control systems with additive disturbances. The robust control problem is reformulated as a convex optimization program by optimizing over configuration-constrained polytopic tubes and tracks a periodic trajectory that is optimal for a given economic criterion. Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a quadratic over-approximation of the periodic cost under a Lipschitz continuity assumption, yielding a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation that preserves the above theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are demonstrated on a benchmark example and a ball-plate system with eight states.</description>

      <title>Any-Time Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves anytime regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{t})$, with explicit dependence on the system dimensions and on the solution of the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE). Our approach uses an appropriately tuned regularization and a sufficiently accurate initial estimate to construct confidence ellipsoids for control design. A carefully designed input-perturbation mechanism is incorporated to ensure anytime performance. We develop two variants of the algorithm. The first enforces strong sequential stability, requiring each policy to be stabilizing and successive policies to remain close. This sequential condition helps prevent state explosion at policy update times; however, it results in a suboptimal regret scaling with respect to the DARE solution. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a second class of algorithms that removes this requirement and instead requires only that each generated policy be stabilizing. Closed-loop stability is then preserved through a dwell-time inspired policy-update rule. This class of algorithms also addresses key shortcomings of most existing approaches which lack explicit high-probability bounds on the state trajectory expressed in system-theoretic terms. Our analysis shows that partially relaxing the sequential-stability requirement yields optimal regret. Finally, our method eliminates the need for any \emph{a priori} bound on the norm of the DARE solution, an assumption required by all existing computationally efficient OFU based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in mean-field games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We prove theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method, a Quasi-Newton optimization technique, this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.</description>

      <title>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electricity sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.</description>

      <title>JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs.
  This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description>

      <title>Structural Integrality in Task Assignment and Path Finding via Total Unimodularity of Petri Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) concerns computing collision-free motions for multiple robots while jointly selecting goal locations. In this paper, safety is enforced by requiring unit-capacity traversal between successive intermediate markings, yielding coordination strategies that are valid independently of any specific time interpretation. Existing optimization-based approaches typically rely on time-expanded network-flow models, which result in large mixed-integer programs and limited scalability. We instead develop a Petri net (PN)-based optimization framework that exploits structural properties of the motion model to improve computational efficiency without explicit time expansion.
  When robot motion is modeled by strongly connected state-machine PNs, we show that, once the congestion level (equivalently, the synchronization depth) is fixed to an integer value, the resulting motion-planning constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Consequently, the corresponding LP relaxation admits integral optimal solutions for the motion variables. When the estimated congestion exceeds one, we introduce a synchronization-on-demand mechanism based on intermediate markings; for a fixed number of synchronization stages, the associated constraint matrices remain totally unimodular, thereby preserving integrality of the motion variables.
  Finally, we extend TAPF to Boolean specifications over regions of interest and propose a two-stage LP/mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheme in which integrality is confined to task-selection variables. Simulations on large benchmarks demonstrate substantial scalability improvements over time-expanded optimization baselines.</description>

      <title>On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have been widely used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.</description>

      <title>STAIR: Stability criterion for Time-windowed Assignment and Internal adversarial influence in Routing and decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of existing routing algorithms for multi-agent systems is that they are designed without considering the potential presence of adversarial agents in the decision-making loop, which could lead to severe performance degradation in real-life applications where adversarial agents may be present. We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.</description>

      <title>An Architecture for Remote Container Builds and Artifact Delivery Using a Controller-Light Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource-intensive builds are often executed directly on the controller by conventional Jenkins installations, which can lower reliability and overload system resources. Jenkins functions as a containerized controller with persistent volumes in the controller-light CI/CD framework presented in this paper, delegating difficult build and packaging tasks to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes while focusing solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automated notifications are all included in the system. Faster build throughput, reduced CPU and RAM consumption on the controller, and reduced artifact delivery latency are all revealed by experimental evaluation. For small and medium-sized DevOps businesses looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance solution.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models is increasingly limited by cognitive failures rather than infrastructure faults. Existing observability tools describe failures but do not quantify how quickly distributed reasoning recovers once coherence is lost. We introduce MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems), a runtime reliability metric that measures cognitive recovery latency in MAS. MTTR-A adapts classical dependability theory to agentic orchestration, capturing the time required to detect reasoning drift and restore coherent operation. We further define complementary metrics, including MTBF and a normalized recovery ratio (NRR), and establish theoretical bounds linking recovery latency to long-run cognitive uptime. Using a LangGraph-based benchmark with simulated drift and reflex recovery, we empirically demonstrate measurable recovery behavior across multiple reflex strategies. This work establishes a quantitative foundation for runtime cognitive dependability in distributed agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>
