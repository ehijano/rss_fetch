      <title>Sparsity-Constraint Optimization via Splicing Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsity-constraint optimization has wide applicability in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. Existing fast algorithms must burdensomely tune parameters, such as the step size or the implementation of precise stop criteria, which may be challenging to determine in practice. To address this issue, we develop an algorithm named Sparsity-Constraint Optimization via sPlicing itEration (SCOPE) to optimize nonlinear differential objective functions with strong convexity and smoothness in low dimensional subspaces. Algorithmically, the SCOPE algorithm converges effectively without tuning parameters. Theoretically, SCOPE has a linear convergence rate and converges to a solution that recovers the true support set when it correctly specifies the sparsity. We also develop parallel theoretical results without restricted-isometry-property-type conditions. We apply SCOPE's versatility and power to solve sparse quadratic optimization, learn sparse classifiers, and recover sparse Markov networks for binary variables. The numerical results on these specific tasks reveal that SCOPE perfectly identifies the true support set with a 10--1000 speedup over the standard exact solver, confirming SCOPE's algorithmic and theoretical merits. Our open-source Python package skscope based on C++ implementation is publicly available on GitHub, reaching a ten-fold speedup on the competing convex relaxation methods implemented by the cvxpy library.</description>

      <title>Using Autodiff to Estimate Posterior Moments, Marginals and Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Importance sampling is a popular technique in Bayesian inference: by reweighting samples drawn from a proposal distribution we are able to obtain samples and moment estimates from a Bayesian posterior over latent variables. Recent work, however, indicates that importance sampling scales poorly -- in order to accurately approximate the true posterior, the required number of importance samples grows is exponential in the number of latent variables [Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018]. Massively parallel importance sampling works around this issue by drawing $K$ samples for each of the $n$ latent variables and reasoning about all $K^n$ combinations of latent samples. In principle, we can reason efficiently over $K^n$ combinations of samples by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. However, in practice this requires complex algorithms that traverse backwards through the graphical model, and we need separate backward traversals for each computation (posterior expectations, marginals and samples). Our contribution is to exploit the source term trick from physics to entirely avoid the need to hand-write backward traversals. Instead, we demonstrate how to simply and easily compute all the required quantities -- posterior expectations, marginals and samples -- by differentiating through a slightly modified marginal likelihood estimator.</description>

      <title>Fast post-process Bayesian inference with Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In applied Bayesian inference scenarios, users may have access to a large number of pre-existing model evaluations, for example from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) optimization runs. However, traditional approximate inference techniques make little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework of post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior approximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model calls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models with black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target density evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP Bayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast approximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational neuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior approximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further model evaluations.</description>

      <title>DU-Shapley: A Shapley Value Proxy for Efficient Dataset Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dataset valuation problem, that is, the problem of quantifying the incremental gain, to some relevant pre-defined utility of a machine learning task, of aggregating an individual dataset to others. The Shapley value is a natural tool to perform dataset valuation due to its formal axiomatic justification, which can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to overcome the computational tractability challenges. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We propose a novel approximation, referred to as discrete uniform Shapley, which is expressed as an expectation under a discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and illustrate its benefits via an extensive set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos Surrogate Construction for Random Fields with Parametric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering and applied science rely on computational experiments to rigorously study physical systems. The mathematical models used to probe these systems are highly complex, and sampling-intensive studies often require prohibitively many simulations for acceptable accuracy. Surrogate models provide a means of circumventing the high computational expense of sampling such complex models. In particular, polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) have been successfully used for uncertainty quantification studies of deterministic models where the dominant source of uncertainty is parametric. We discuss an extension to conventional PCE surrogate modeling to enable surrogate construction for stochastic computational models that have intrinsic noise in addition to parametric uncertainty. We develop a PCE surrogate on a joint space of intrinsic and parametric uncertainty, enabled by Rosenblatt transformations, and then extend the construction to random field data via the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. We then take advantage of closed-form solutions for computing PCE Sobol indices to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model which quantifies the intrinsic noise contribution to the overall model output variance. Additionally, the resulting joint PCE is generative in the sense that it allows generating random realizations at any input parameter setting that are statistically approximately equivalent to realizations from the underlying stochastic model. The method is demonstrated on a chemical catalysis example model.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Outlier Detection via Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method is a widely adopted tool for robust estimation and outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for model selection in MCD with spectral embedding based on the notion of stability. Our best subset algorithm leverages principal component analysis for dimension reduction, statistical depths for effective initialization, and concentration steps for subset refinement. Subsequently, we construct a bootstrap procedure to estimate the instability of the best subset algorithm. The parameter combination exhibiting minimal instability proves ideal for the purposes of high-dimensional outlier detection, while the instability path offers insights into the inlier/outlier structure. We rigorously benchmark the proposed framework against existing MCD variants and illustrate its practical utility on two spectra data sets and a cancer genomics data set.</description>
