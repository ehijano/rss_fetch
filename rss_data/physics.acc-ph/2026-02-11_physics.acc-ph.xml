      <title>Synchrotron-based Photonuclear Neutron Source for Energy, Medicine and Radiation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global availability of high-intensity neutron sources is restricted by the prohibitive costs of spallation facilities and the decommissioning of aging research reactors, while compact accelerator-driven sources (CANS) are fundamentally limited by target power density and thermal-mechanical stress. Here, we introduce SYNERGY (SYnchrotron-driven NEutron source for Research, energy Generation and therapY), a paradigm-shifting architecture that overcomes these bottlenecks by decoupling charged-particle acceleration from neutron production. By utilizing a storage ring to drive external photoneutron targets via synchrotron radiation, this topological separation ensures targets interact exclusively with a continuous-wave (CW) photon beam, minimizing thermo-mechanical shocks and enabling beam powers exceeding 200 kW per beamline. Through a systematic parametric analysis cross-validated using OpenMC, MCNPX, and FLUKA, we demonstrate single-beamline neutron production rates from $2.8\times10^{14}$ n/s to $1.3\times10^{15}$ n/s. With an inherent multi-beamline capacity feeding up to 50 independent stations, the total facility intensity exceeds $6.0\times10^{16}$ n/s. By bridging the gap between laboratory and national-scale infrastructure, SYNERGY provides a high-intensity, multi-user platform for subcritical systems, medical isotope production, and boron neutron capture therapy.</description>

      <title>X-ray reflection: a FLUKA model and its application in the design of synchrotron light beamlines and CERN's Future Circular Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on atomic scattering factors from evaluated databases, a new model for the reflectivity of x rays on solid surfaces has been developed for FLUKA v4-6.0. This model accounts for the variation of reflectivity as a function of the photon energy, its incidence angle, and linear polarisation; surface roughness effects are also taken into account. FLUKA reflectivities agree well with those obtained from state-of-the-art codes used for the characterization of optical devices, both for homogeneous solids and for multilayer mirrors. This new capability renders FLUKA a nearly one-stop shop for synchrotron radiation simulations: emission from bending magnets and wigglers, photon transport and interaction, electromagnetic (and hadronic when applicable) shower development in complex geometries, as well as x-ray reflection at designated solid surfaces can now be all accounted for in a single FLUKA run. This streamlined FLUKA simulation workflow greatly simplifies the plethora of simulation tools that Monte Carlo practitioners previously needed to rely on. Two application scenarios of this new reflectivity model are showcased: first, the use of a multilayer mirror to deflect x rays from an optical hutch onto an experimental hall at the MINERVA beamline of the ALBA synchrotron and, second, the assessment of the photon flux near the interaction point at the CERN's Future Circular Collider (in its electron-positron stage) as a result of upstream x-ray reflections.</description>
