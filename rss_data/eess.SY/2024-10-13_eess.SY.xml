      <title>A Comprehensive Review: Impacts of Extreme Temperatures due to Climate Change on Power Grid Infrastructure and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power grid is experiencing a multi-fold transformation while the global climate evolves with record-breaking extreme temperatures during heat domes, polar vortexes, and severe ice. Over the decades, these extreme temperature events have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity. The power grid infrastructure is geographically spread over thousands of square miles with millions of small and large components, and the impact of extreme temperature operations on the grid infrastructure needs to be researched further. This paper reviews academic literature, standards, industry articles, and federal reports to identify the impacts of heat domes, polar vortexes, and icing on all the T\&amp;D grid equipment, including substations (assets owned and operated by the utilities and independent system operators). This paper classifies the equipment into primary and auxiliary equipment and determines its vulnerability to extreme temperatures for a deeper analysis of a more critical and vulnerable set of grid equipment. For each equipment under consideration, its fundamental role in the system, the impact of extreme temperatures on its operation, available monitoring, and mitigation of these impacts are discussed. The paper develops insights on standards readiness and identifies gaps concerning extreme temperature definitions. The paper also develops summary tables to identify the critical failure modes for each type of equipment, failure influence diagrams, and cascading influence diagrams to highlight and aid in translating the equipment vulnerability information into power grid contingency definitions that need to be considered in grid planning and operations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Inverters: A Unified Control Design for Grid-Forming, Grid-Following, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, integrated control framework designed to achieve seamless transitions among a spectrum of inverter operation modes. The operation spectrum includes grid-forming (GFM), grid-following (GFL), static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), energy storage system (ESS), and voltage source inverter (VSI). The proposed control architecture offers guarantees of stability, robustness, and performance regardless of the specific mode. The core concept involves establishing a unified algebraic structure for the feedback control system, where different modes are defined by the magnitude of closed-loop signals. As we demonstrate, this approach results in a two-dimensional continuum of operation modes and enables transition trajectories between operation modes by dynamically adjusting closed-loop variables towards corresponding setpoints. Stability, robustness, and fundamental limitation analyses are provided for the closed-loop system across any mode, as well as during transitions between modes. This design facilitates stable and enhanced on-grid integration, even during GFM operation and weak grid conditions. Ultimately, we demonstrate the key attributes of the proposed framework through simulations and experiments, showcasing its seamless transition in on-grid operation, functionality in islanded mode, and robustness to line impedance uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed adaptive control strategy for multi-agent systems with heterogeneous dynamics and collision avoidance. We propose an adaptive control strategy designed to ensure leader-following formation consensus while effectively managing collision and obstacle avoidance using potential functions. By integrating neural network-based disturbance estimation and adaptive tuning laws, the proposed strategy ensures consensus and stability in leader-following formations under fixed topologies.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Distributed Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization over Time-Varying Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed stochastic non-convex optimization problems have recently received attention due to the growing interest of signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing communities in applications deployed over distributed learning systems (e.g., federated learning). We study the setting where the data is distributed across the nodes of a time-varying directed network, a topology suitable for modeling dynamic networks experiencing communication delays and straggler effects. The network nodes, which can access only their local objectives and query a stochastic first-order oracle to obtain gradient estimates, collaborate to minimize a global objective function by exchanging messages with their neighbors. We propose an algorithm, novel to this setting, that leverages stochastic gradient descent with momentum and gradient tracking to solve distributed non-convex optimization problems over time-varying networks. To analyze the algorithm, we tackle the challenges that arise when analyzing dynamic network systems which communicate gradient acceleration components. We prove that the algorithm's oracle complexity is $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{1.5})$, and that under Polyak-$\L$ojasiewicz condition the algorithm converges linearly to a steady error state. The proposed scheme is tested on several learning tasks: a non-convex logistic regression experiment on the MNIST dataset, an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and an NLP classification test on the IMDB dataset. We further present numerical simulations with an objective that satisfies the PL condition. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework compared to the existing related methods.</description>

      <title>A System of Bidirectional Power Routing Toward Multi-energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system of bidirectional power routing for inter-house multi-energy management systems that utilize electricity and hydrogen as energy carriers. The key is to share private facilities such as photovoltaic panels and batteries among a group of houses along with a common hydrogen system. A power router of line switching type is introduced as a physical interface to realize the sharing economy between households. The proposed system offers a unique measure to address the urgent challenges of today's multi-energy system, namely increasing the renewables' self-consumption, enhancing the energy system's resilience, and providing traceability of hydrogen in terms of renewability certification. We also present an experimental demonstration under a simplified scenario using prototype hardware.</description>

      <title>Achieving multi uav best viewpoint coordination in obstructed environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfire suppression is a complex task that poses high risks to humans. Using robotic teams for wildfire suppression enhances the safety and efficiency of detecting, monitoring, and extinguishing fires. We propose a control architecture based on task hierarchical control for the autonomous steering of a system of flying robots in wildfire suppression. We incorporate a novel line-of-sight obstacle avoidance method that calculates the best viewpoints and ensures an occlusion-free view for the suppression robot during the mission. Path integral control generates optimal trajectories towards the goals. We conduct an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to scenarios where these key components are excluded, in order to validate the approach in simulations using Matlab and Unity. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with 44.0 % increase in effectiveness with the new line-of-sight obstacle avoidance task and up to 39.6 % improvement when using path integral control.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Optimal State Estimation with Low Complexity via Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal state estimation problem for dynamic systems while preserving private information against an adversary. To dominate the adversary's estimation accuracy about private information in the mean square error (MSE) sense, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is employed to evaluate privacy level. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization, which minimizes the MSE of the state estimate with a constraint on privacy level, achieving a trade-off between privacy and utility. To solve the constrained optimization problem, an explicit expression for CRLB is first provided using the information inequality. To overcome the increasing sizes of the involved matrices over time, a low-complexity approach is then proposed to achieve online calculation for CRLB, significantly reducing computational complexity. Next, the optimization problem is relaxed to a semi-definite programming problem, and a relaxed solution is provided. Finally, a privacy-preserving state estimation algorithm with low complexity is developed and proved to achieve differential privacy. Two illustrative examples, including a practical case of building occupancy, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust Variable-Horizon MPC with Adaptive Terminal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust variable-horizon model predictive control scheme designed to intercept a target moving along a known trajectory, in finite time. Linear discrete-time systems affected by bounded process disturbances are considered and a tube-based MPC approach is adopted. The main contribution is an adaptive mechanism for choosing the terminal constraint set sequence in the MPC optimization problem. This mechanism is designed to ensure recursive feasibility while promoting minimization of the final distance to the target. Finite-time convergence of the proposed control scheme is proven. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, the designed control law is tested through numerical simulations, including a case study involving orbital rendezvous of a satellite with a tumbling object. The results indicate a significant reduction in conservatism compared to existing state-of-the-art methods using a fixed terminal set sequence.</description>

      <title>Transformer Temperature Management and Voltage Control in Electric Distribution Systems with High Solar PV Penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in distribution grids can lead to overvoltage and transformer overloading issues. While voltage regulation has been extensively studied and some research has addressed transformer temperature control, there is limited work on simultaneously managing both challenges. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an optimization-based strategy that efficiently manages voltage regulation and transformer temperature while minimizing the curtailment of PV generation. In order to make this problem convex, a relaxation is applied to the transformer temperature dynamics constraint. We also provide analysis to determine under which conditions this relaxation remains tight. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the desired control objectives.</description>

      <title>Practical identification approach for the actuation dynamics of autonomous surface vehicles with minimal instrumentation: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00631v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A practical method for identifying the propeller model and inertia matrix of a marine Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) is proposed in this work. Special attention is paid to limiting the instrumentation requirements. Based on a generic grey-box dynamic modelling addressing the considered catamaran-shaped ASV architecture, the static/dynamic behaviour of both propellers and the vessel dynamic are jointly estimated using the sole measurements of position, heading, and propellers pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. No accelerometer is required. Two distinct grey-box configurations involving either a static polynomial or a dynamic modelling of each propeller are proposed and compared. The resulting ASV identification methodology is shown to provide insight into the whole vessel inertial characteristics, which are key enablers in the development of autonomous navigation and control systems. Model validation was performed using data collected from the reported experiments. Model prediction errors related to both linear velocities and yaw rate are evaluated and compared based on given metrics. The results underscore the robustness and accuracy of the identified models in capturing the essential dynamics of the ASV, with a determination coefficient that consistently exceeds 0.94 for all estimated velocities.</description>

      <title>From Uncertainty to Innovation: Wearable Prototyping with ProtoBot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite AI advancements, individuals without software or hardware expertise still face barriers in designing wearable electronic devices due to the lack of code-free prototyping tools. To eliminate these barriers, we designed ProtoBot, leveraging large language models, and conducted a case study with four professionals from different disciplines through playful interaction. The study resulted in four unique wearable device concepts, with participants using Protobot to prototype selected components. From this experience, we learned that (1) uncertainty can be turned into a positive experience, (2) the ProtoBot should transform to reliably act as a guide, and (3) users need to adjust design parameters when interacting with the prototypes. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the use of large language models in rapid prototyping of wearable electronics. We believe this approach will pioneer rapid prototyping without fear of uncertainties for people who want to develop both wearable prototypes and other products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of designing motion planning algorithms for control-affine systems that generate collision-free paths from an initial to a final destination and can be executed using safe and dynamically-feasible controllers. We introduce the C-CLF-CBF-RRT algorithm, which produces paths with such properties and leverages rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs), control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs). We show that C-CLF-CBF-RRT is computationally efficient for a variety of different dynamics and obstacles, and establish its probabilistic completeness. We showcase the performance of C-CLF-CBF-RRT in different simulation and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Opacity Enforcement by Edit Functions Under Incomparable Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an information-flow privacy property, opacity characterizes whether a malicious external observer (referred to as an intruder) is able to infer the secret behavior of a system. This paper addresses the problem of opacity enforcement using edit functions in discrete event systems modeled by partially observed deterministic finite automata. A defender uses the edit function as an interface at the output of a system to manipulate actual observations through insertion, substitution, and deletion operations so that the intruder will be prevented from inferring the secret behavior of the system. Unlike existing work which usually assumes that the observation capabilities of the intruder and the defender are identical, we consider a more general setting where they may observe incomparable subsets of events generated by the system.To characterize whether the defender has the ability to enforce opacity of the system under this setting, the notion of \emph{$ic$-enforceability} is introduced. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a two-player game, with imperfect information between the system and the defender, which can be used to determine a feasible decision-making strategy for the defender. Within the game scheme, an edit mechanism is constructed to enumerate all feasible edit actions following system behavior. We further show that an $ic$-enforcing edit function (if one exists) can be synthesized from the edit mechanism to enforce opacity.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Edge Case Detection in Automated Driving: Methods, Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs) promises to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety and efficiency. However, ensuring their reliability in diverse real-world conditions remains a significant challenge, particularly due to rare and unexpected situations known as edge cases. Although numerous approaches exist for detecting edge cases, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews these techniques. This paper fills this gap by presenting a practical, hierarchical review and systematic classification of edge case detection and assessment methodologies. Our classification is structured on two levels: first, categorizing detection approaches according to AV modules, including perception-related and trajectory-related edge cases; and second, based on underlying methodologies and theories guiding these techniques. We extend this taxonomy by introducing a new class called "knowledge-driven" approaches, which is largely overlooked in the literature. Additionally, we review the techniques and metrics for the evaluation of edge case detection methods and identified edge cases. To our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively cover edge case detection methods across all AV subsystems, discuss knowledge-driven edge cases, and explore evaluation techniques for detection methods. This structured and multi-faceted analysis aims to facilitate targeted research and modular testing of AVs. Moreover, by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches and discussing the challenges and future directions, this survey intends to assist AV developers, researchers, and policymakers in enhancing the safety and reliability of automated driving (AD) systems through effective edge case detection.</description>

      <title>Energy-Cautious Designation of Kinematic Parameters for a Sustainable Parallel-Serial Heavy-Duty Manipulator Driven by Electromechanical Linear Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08600</link>

Abstract: Electrification, a key strategy in combating climate change, is transforming industries, and off-highway machines (OHM) will be next to transition from combustion engines and hydraulic actuation to sustainable fully electrified machines. Electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs) offer superior efficiency, safety, and reduced maintenance, and they unlock vast potential for high-performance autonomous operations. However, a key challenge lies in optimizing the kinematic parameters of OHMs' on-board manipulators for EMLA integration to exploit the full capabilities of actuation systems and maximize their performance. This work addresses this challenge by delving into the structural optimization of a prevalent closed kinematic chain configuration commonly employed in OHM manipulators. Our approach aims to retain the manipulator's existing capabilities while reducing its energy expenditure, paving the way for a greener future in industrial automation, one in which sustainable and high-performing robotized OHMs can evolve. The feasibility of our methodology is validated through simulation results obtained on a commercially available parallel-serial heavy-duty manipulator mounted on a battery electric vehicle. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in modifying kinematic parameters to facilitate the replacement of conventional hydraulic actuators with EMLAs, all while minimizing the overall energy consumption of the system.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Feedback Control of Lattice Structures with Localized Actuation and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembling lattices from discrete building blocks enables the composition of large, heterogeneous, and easily reconfigurable objects with desirable mass-to-stiffness ratios. This type of building system may also be referred to as a digital material, as it is constituted from discrete, error-correcting components. Researchers have demonstrated various active structures and even robotic systems that take advantage of the reconfigurable, mass-efficient properties of discrete lattice structures. However, the existing literature has predominantly used open-loop control strategies, limiting the performance of the presented systems. In this paper, we present a novel approach to feedback control of digital lattice structures, leveraging real-time measurements of the system dynamics. We introduce an actuated voxel which constitutes a novel means for actuation of lattice structures. Our control method is based on the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition algorithm in conjunction with the Linear Quadratic Regulator and the Koopman Model Predictive Control. The key advantage of our approach lies in its purely data-driven nature, without the need for any prior knowledge of a system's structure. We illustrate the developed method via real experiments with custom-built flexible lattice beam, showing its ability to accomplish various tasks even with minimal sensing and actuation resources. In particular, we address two problems: stabilization together with disturbance attenuation, and reference tracking.</description>

      <title>MMLF: Multi-modal Multi-class Late Fusion for Object Detection with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving necessitates advanced object detection techniques that integrate information from multiple modalities to overcome the limitations associated with single-modal approaches. The challenges of aligning diverse data in early fusion and the complexities, along with overfitting issues introduced by deep fusion, underscore the efficacy of late fusion at the decision level. Late fusion ensures seamless integration without altering the original detector's network structure. This paper introduces a pioneering Multi-modal Multi-class Late Fusion method, designed for late fusion to enable multi-class detection. Fusion experiments conducted on the KITTI validation and official test datasets illustrate substantial performance improvements, presenting our model as a versatile solution for multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving. Moreover, our approach incorporates uncertainty analysis into the classification fusion process, rendering our model more transparent and trustworthy and providing more reliable insights into category predictions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</description>

      <title>Towards a Health-Based Power Grid Optimization in the Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric power sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the world. In recent years, there has been an unprecedented increase in electricity demand driven by the so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution. Although AI has and will continue to have a transformative impact, its environmental and health impacts are often overlooked. The standard approach to power grid optimization aims to minimize CO$_2$ emissions. In this paper, we propose a new holistic paradigm. Our proposed optimization directly targets the minimization of adverse health outcomes under energy efficiency and emission constraints. We show the first example of an optimal fuel mix allocation problem aiming to minimize the average number of adverse health effects resulting from exposure to hazardous air pollutants with constraints on the average and marginal emissions. We argue that this new health-based power grid optimization is essential to promote truly sustainable technological advances that align both with global climate goals and public health priorities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid System Stability Analysis of Multi-Lane Mixed-Autonomy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold vast potential to enhance transportation systems by reducing congestion, improving safety, and lowering emissions. AV controls lead to emergent traffic phenomena; one such intriguing phenomenon is traffic breaks (rolling roadblocks), where a single AV efficiently stabilizes multiple lanes through frequent lane switching, similar to the highway patrolling officers weaving across multiple lanes during difficult traffic conditions. While previous theoretical studies focus on single-lane mixed-autonomy systems, this work proposes a stability analysis framework for multi-lane systems under AV controls. Casting this problem into the hybrid system paradigm, the proposed analysis integrates continuous vehicle dynamics and discrete jumps from AV lane-switches. Through examining the influence of the lane-switch frequency on the system's stability, the analysis offers a principled explanation to the traffic break phenomena, and further discovers opportunities for less-intrusive traffic smoothing by employing less frequent lane-switching. The analysis further facilitates the design of traffic-aware AV lane-switch strategies to enhance system stability. Numerical analysis reveals a strong alignment between the theory and simulation, validating the effectiveness of the proposed stability framework in analyzing multi-lane mixed-autonomy traffic systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Planning Model for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Feedback Optimization for Real-time Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time voltage regulation problem in distribution systems employing online feedback optimization (OFO) with short-range communication between physical neighbours. OFO does not need an accurate grid model nor estimated consumption of non-controllable loads, affords fast calculations, and demonstrates robustness to uncertainties and disturbances, which render it particularly suitable for real-time distribution system applications. However, many OFO controllers require centralized communication, making them susceptible to single-point failures. This paper proposes a distributed OFO design based on a nested feedback optimization strategy and analyzes its convergence. Numerical study results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves effective voltage regulation and outperforms other distributed and local approaches.</description>

      <title>Nationally Scalable Hydrogen Fueling Infrastructure Deployment: A Megaregion Analysis and Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing regional and long-haul freight faces challenges due to the limitations of battery-electric vehicles and infrastructure. Hydrogen fuel cell medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) present a promising alternative, aligning with the Department of Energy's decarbonization goals. Historically, alternative fuels like compressed natural gas and propane gas have seen slow adoption due to infrastructure barriers. To prevent similar setbacks, planning for zero-emission hydrogen fueling infrastructure is critical. This research develops plans for affordable and accessible hydrogen refueling stations, supporting the decarbonized freight system and benefiting underserved and rural communities by improving air quality, reducing noise pollution, and enhancing energy resilience. It provides a blueprint for replacing diesel in Class 8 trucks with hydrogen fueling solutions, focusing on the Texas Triangle Megaregion (I-45, I-35, I-10), the I-10 corridor between San Antonio, TX, and Los Angeles, CA, and the I-5/CA-99 corridors between Los Angeles and San Francisco. This area accounts for ~8.5% of U.S. heavy-duty freight volume. Using the OR-AGENT (Optimal Regional Architecture Generation for Electrified National Transport) framework, the study analyzes vehicles, freight networks, and energy systems. The framework integrates data on freight mobility, traffic, weather, and energy pathways to deliver optimized powertrain architectures and hydrogen fueling infrastructure deployment. It assesses all vehicle origin-destination pairs and feasible fueling station locations, using a genetic algorithm to identify the minimum number and optimal locations of hydrogen stations. It also determines fuel schedules and quantities, ensuring no vehicle is stranded. A deployment roadmap outlines strategic hydrogen refueling infrastructure rollout across multiple adoption scenarios.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression on Sparse and Noisy Data with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of deriving dynamical models from sparse and noisy data. High-quality data is crucial for symbolic regression algorithms; limited and noisy data can present modeling challenges. To overcome this, we combine Gaussian process regression with a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to denoise the data and identify nonlinear dynamical equations. Our approach GPSINDy offers improved robustness with sparse, noisy data compared to SINDy alone. We demonstrate its effectiveness on simulation data from Lotka-Volterra and unicycle models and hardware data from an NVIDIA JetRacer system. We show superior performance over baselines including more than 50% improvement over SINDy and other baselines in predicting future trajectories from noise-corrupted and sparse 5 Hz data.</description>

      <title>Controllable Preference Optimization: Toward Controllable Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving improvements in multi-objective alignment.</description>

      <title>Social Zone as a Barrier Function for Socially-Compliant Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of integrating social norms into robot navigation, which is essential for ensuring that robots operate safely and efficiently in human-centric environments. Social norms, often unspoken and implicitly understood among people, are difficult to explicitly define and implement in robotic systems. To overcome this, we derive these norms from real human trajectory data, utilizing the comprehensive ATC dataset to identify the minimum social zones humans and robots must respect. These zones are integrated into the robot's navigation system by applying barrier functions, ensuring the robot consistently remains within the designated safety set. Simulation results demonstrate that our system effectively mimics human-like navigation strategies, such as passing on the right side and adjusting speed or pausing in constrained spaces. The proposed framework is versatile, easily comprehensible, and tunable, demonstrating the potential to advance the development of robots designed to navigate effectively in human-centric environments.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-based Approach Towards Traceable Behavior Specifications in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in a German legal context with two example scenarios and evaluate our results. Our evaluation shows that the explicit documentation of assumptions in the behavior specification supports both the identification of specification insufficiencies and their treatment. Therefore, this article provides requirements, terminology and an according methodology to facilitate ontology-based behavior specifications in automated driving.</description>
