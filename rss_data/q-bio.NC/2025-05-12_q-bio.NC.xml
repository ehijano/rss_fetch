      <title>Attachment: a predictive coding approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel predictive coding framework for studying attachment theory. Building off an established model of attachment, the dynamic-maturational model (DMM), as well as the neuroanatomical Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model of interoception and emotion, we not only elucidate how neural processes can shape attachment strategies, but also explore how early attachment experiences can shape those processes in the first place. Returning to John Bowlby's original vision for attachment theory, our framework is based on four simple, empirically-supported principles that can easily be interpreted with predictive coding.
  We apply our framework to further our understanding of the attachment strategies in the DMM. Specifically, we propose that the type A strategies (analogous to "avoidant" or "dismissive" attachment) involve the suppression of interoceptive prediction errors as an adaptive response to maltreatment, relieving stress in the short-term at the cost of interoceptive awareness in the long-term. Furthermore, we propose that type C strategies (analogous to "ambivalent/resistant" or "preoccupied" attachment) involve the suppression of exteroceptive prediction errors to reflect the unreliability of external cues, motivating the obsessive seeking of information through increased vigilance and histrionic displays of affect. Finally, we explore the implications of our proposals, making several novel hypotheses that could have implications for the treatment of attachment-related psychopathology.</description>

      <title>Qualia &amp; Natural Selection: Formal Constraints on the Evolution of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores foundational questions about the relationship of qualia to natural selection. The primary result is a derivation of specific formal conditions under which structural systems subject to natural selection can convey consistent effects in an associated qualitative domain, placing theoretical and empirical constraints on theories of consciousness. In order to achieve this result, information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, quantifying fidelity between the two domains. The fidelities represented by that space are then incorporated into the Price Equation to yield key bounds on the transmission of selective effects between domains. Finally, transmission of higher-order structures between domains is explored. Placement within a broader philosophical context can be found in the companion paper Structure &amp; Quality.</description>

      <title>Structure &amp; Quality: Conceptual and Formal Foundations for the Mind-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the hard problem of consciousness from a different perspective. Instead of drawing distinctions between the physical and the mental, an exploration of a more foundational relationship is examined: the relationship between structure and quality.
  Information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, including a novel Q-S space for analyzing fidelity between the two domains. This novel space naturally points toward a five-fold categorization of possible relationships between structural and qualitative properties, illustrating each through conceptual and formal models.
  The ontological implications of each category are examined, shedding light on debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral monism.
  This new line of inquiry has established a framework for deriving theoretical constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution that is explored in my companion paper, Qualia &amp; Natural Selection.</description>

      <title>A Neuro-Dynamic Mathematical Model of Dream Formation and Spontaneous Cognitive Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a biomathematical model designed to describe the internal dynamics of dream formation and spontaneous cognitive processes. The model incorporates neurocognitive factors such as dissatisfaction, acceptance, forgetting, and mental activity, each of which is linked to established neural systems. We formulate a system of differential equations to simulate interactions among these variables and validate the model using simulated neural data. Our results demonstrate biologically plausible cognitive patterns consistent with findings from EEG and fMRI studies, particularly related to the default mode network (DMN), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampal memory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The cognitive triple-slit experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.</description>

      <title>Nature's Insight: A Novel Framework and Comprehensive Analysis of Agentic Reasoning Through the Lens of Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous AI is no longer a hard-to-reach concept, it enables the agents to move beyond executing tasks to independently addressing complex problems, adapting to change while handling the uncertainty of the environment. However, what makes the agents truly autonomous? It is agentic reasoning, that is crucial for foundation models to develop symbolic logic, statistical correlations, or large-scale pattern recognition to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions. However, it remains unclear why and how existing agentic reasoning approaches work, in comparison to biological reasoning, which instead is deeply rooted in neural mechanisms involving hierarchical cognition, multimodal integration, and dynamic interactions. In this work, we propose a novel neuroscience-inspired framework for agentic reasoning. Grounded in three neuroscience-based definitions and supported by mathematical and biological foundations, we propose a unified framework modeling reasoning from perception to action, encompassing four core types, perceptual, dimensional, logical, and interactive, inspired by distinct functional roles observed in the human brain. We apply this framework to systematically classify and analyze existing AI reasoning methods, evaluating their theoretical foundations, computational designs, and practical limitations. We also explore its implications for building more generalizable, cognitively aligned agents in physical and virtual environments. Finally, building on our framework, we outline future directions and propose new neural-inspired reasoning methods, analogous to chain-of-thought prompting. By bridging cognitive neuroscience and AI, this work offers a theoretical foundation and practical roadmap for advancing agentic reasoning in intelligent systems.
