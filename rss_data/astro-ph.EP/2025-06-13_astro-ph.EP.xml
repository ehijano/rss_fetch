      <title>No influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (&gt;400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>

      <title>On the Mass Budget Problem of Protoplanetary Disks: Streaming Instability and Optically Thick Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical studies of protoplanetary disks and exoplanet populations often exhibit a "missing mass" problem, where observed dust masses in (sub-)millimeter surveys are significantly lower than expected when compared to the mass of evolved exoplanetary systems. We investigate how the streaming instability and subsequent planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks might solve this missing mass problem when (sub-)millimeter observations are interpreted under the assumption of optically thin emission. We conduct hydrodynamical simulations of the streaming instability with self-gravity after which radiative transfer calculations with dust scattering are performed to measure the (sub-)millimeter intensity. The measured intensity is then used to estimate the disk mass under the assumption of optically thin emission and compared to the true mass in the simulation to calculate the observational bias via the mass excess. We find that the emission from overdense filaments that emerge due to the streaming instability are optically thick at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, leading to mass excess factors of $\sim 2-7$, even when the optically thick fraction is low.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): II. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Ophiuchus Star-forming Region</title>

Abstract: The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (&gt;70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (&gt;60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): III. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Lupus Star-forming Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): IV. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Upper Scorpius Star-forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): V. Protoplanetary gas disk masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the gas mass of planet-forming disks around young stars is crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time, from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (&lt;1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4 Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6 Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120, suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VI. Comparison of Dust Evolution Models to AGE-PRO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VII. Testing accretion mechanisms from disk population synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architecture of planetary systems depends on the evolution of the disks in which they form. In this work, we develop a population synthesis approach to interpret the AGE-PRO measurements of disk gas mass and size considering two scenarios: turbulence-driven evolution with photoevaporative winds and MHD disk-wind-driven evolution. A systematic method is proposed to constrain the distribution of disk parameters from the disk fractions, accretion rates, disk gas masses, and CO gas sizes. We find that turbulence-driven accretion with initially compact disks ($R_0 \simeq 5-20~$au), low mass-loss rates, and relatively long viscous timescales ($t_{\nu,0} \simeq 0.4-3~$Myr or $\alpha_{SS} \simeq 2-4 \times 10^{-4}$) can reproduce the disk fraction and gas sizes. However, the distribution of apparent disk lifetime defined as the $M_D/\dot{M}_*$ ratio is severely overestimated by turbulence-driven models. On the other hand, MHD wind-driven accretion can reproduce the bulk properties of the disk populations from Ophiuchus to Upper Sco assuming compact disks with an initial magnetization of about $\beta \simeq 10^5$ ($\alpha_{DW} \simeq 0.5-1 \times 10^{-3}$) and a magnetic field that declines with time. More studies are needed to confirm the low masses found by AGE-PRO, notably for compact disks that question turbulence-driven accretion. The constrained synthetic disk populations can now be used for realistic planet population models to interpret the properties of planetary systems on a statistical basis.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VIII. The impact of external photoevaporation on disk masses and radii in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor &lt;2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): X. Dust Substructures, Disk Geometries, and Dust-disk Radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform visibility fitting to the dust continuum Band 6 1.3 mm data of the 30 protoplanetary disks in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We obtain disk geometries, dust-disk radii, and azimuthally symmetric radial profiles of the intensity of the dust continuum emission. We examine the presence of continuum substructures in the AGE-PRO sample by using these radial profiles and their residuals. We detect substructures in 15 out of 30 disks. We report five disks with large ($&gt;$15 au) inner dust cavities. The Ophiuchus Class I disks show dust-disk substructures in $\sim80\%$ of the resolved sources. This evidences the early formation of substructures in protoplanetary disks. A spiral is identified in IRS 63, hinting to gravitational instability in this massive disk. We compare our dust-disk brightness radial profiles with gas-disk brightness radial profiles and discuss colocal substructures in both tracers. In addition, we discuss the evolution of dust-disk radii and substructures across Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius. We find that disks in Lupus and Upper Scorpius with large inner dust cavities have typical gas-disk masses, suggesting an abundance of dust cavities in these regions. The prevalence of pressure dust traps at later ages is supported by a potential trend with time with more disks with large inner dust cavities (or "transition disks") in Upper Scorpius and the absence of evolution of dust-disk sizes with time in the AGE-PRO sample. We propose this is caused by an evolutionary sequence with a high fraction of protoplanetary disks with inner protoplanets carving dust cavities.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XI. Beam-corrected gas disk sizes from fitting 12CO moment zero maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inward drift of mm-cm sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks has become an important part of our current theories of planet formation and, more recently, planet composition as well. The gas-to-dust size ratio of protoplanetary disks can provide an important constraint on how pebbles have drifted inward provided that observational effects, especially resolution, can be accounted for. Here we present a method for fitting beam-convolved models to integrated intensity maps of line emission using the astropy python package and use it to fit 12 CO moment zero maps of ten Lupus and ten Upper Scorpius protoplanetary disks from the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program, a sample of disks around M3-K6 stars that cover the ~1 to 6 Myr of gas disk evolution. From the unconvolved best fit models we measure the gas disk size (RCO,90%[model]), which we combine with the dust disk size (Rdust,90%[FRANK]) from continuum visibility fits from Vioque et al. (2025, in press.) to compute beam-corrected gas-to-dust size ratios. In our sample we find gas-to-dust size ratios between ~1 and ~5.5, with a median value of 2.78(+0.37,-0.32). Contrary to models of dust evolution that predict an increasing size ratio with time, we find that the younger disks in Lupus have similar (or even larger) median ratios (3.02(+0.33,-0.33)) than the older disks in Upper Sco (2.46(+0.53,-0.38)). A possible explanation to this discrepancy is that pebble drift is halted in dust traps combined with truncation of the gas disk by external photo-evaporation in Upper Sco, although survivorship bias could also play a role.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII. Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

      <title>The Gap-Giant Association: Are Planets Hiding in the Gaps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A handful of stars are known to host both an inner system of multiple transiting planets and an outer giant planet. These systems all feature a prominent gap between the orbits of two of the transiting planets, distinguishing them from typical multiplanet systems with more uniform orbital spacings. The reason for the association between inner gaps and outer giants is unknown. In this paper, we assess whether undiscovered planets might occupy these gaps in systems with outer giants. For each of the four relevant systems - Kepler-48, Kepler-65, Kepler-90, and Kepler-139 - we found that a $\sim 2 - 20 M_\oplus$ planet could reside in the gap without inducing dynamical instability. However, in each case, the gravitational influence of the outer giant planet is insufficient to tilt the orbit of the hypothetical planet by enough to prevent transits, ruling out a proposed theory for the observed gap-giant association. The gaps might instead contain smaller, undetectable planets ($ \lesssim 0.5 - 1\,R_\oplus$), or be entirely devoid of planets.</description>

      <title>Nethotrons: exploring the possibility of measuring relativistic spin precessions, from Earth's satellites to the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By ``nethotrons'', from the ancient Greek verb for to ``spin'', it is meant here a natural or artificial rotating object, like a pulsar or an artificial satellite, whose rotational axis is cumulatively displaced by the post-Newtonian static (gravitoelectric) and stationary (gravitomagnetic) components of the gravitational field of some massive body around which it freely moves. Until now, both relativistic effects have been measured only by the dedicated space-based mission Gravity Probe B in the terrestrial environment. It detected the gravitoelectric de Sitter and gravitomagnetic Pugh-Schiff spin precessions of four superconducting gyroscopes accumulated in a year after about 50 years from conception to completion of data analysis at a cost of 750 million dollars to $0.3$ and $19$ per cent accuracy, respectively. The perspectives to measure them also with long-lived Earth's laser-ranged geodetic satellites, like those of the LAGEOS family or possibly one or more of them to be built specifically from scratch, and pulsars orbiting the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre, yet to be discovered, are preliminarily investigated. The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B is examined as well.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Processes in Stellar Flares on AU Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 Angstrom). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 Angstrom) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-ranging satellites have proved their efficiency in high precision testing of General Relativity and constraining modified gravity theories proposed to explain the dark sector and the cosmological tensions. The LARES 2 satellite launched in 2022, is currently providing improved information regarding the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity, as well as the geodesy, thus essentially complementing the data of already existing laser-ranging satellites. The proper knowledge of the Earth's tidal perturbation modes is essential for accurately extracting the sought frame-dragging signal. We present the results of computation of 110 significant modes in Doodson number classification for the parameters of LARES 2 satellite, continuing our previous study on those obtained for the LARES satellite.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.06704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems can evolve dynamically even after the planets themselves have fully formed, and there is circumstantial evidence that most planetary systems become unstable after the disappearance of the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Theories of planet formation predict that chains of mean motion resonances are the natural outcome of disk-driven planet migration, leading to the pile up of super-Earths resonant chains close to the inner edge of the disk and the formation of fragile chains for distant giant planets. Observations of young systems suggest that they are more often locked in these chains than older ones, which are instead mostly non-resonant. The instabilities thought responsible for this trend can arise intrinsically if the original systems are too closely packed, or be due to external perturbations such as tides, planetesimal scattering, or torques from distant stellar companions. The Solar System was not exceptional in this sense, as the outer giants saw the disruption of a resonant chain; meanwhile, the inner system was likely built through a series of giant impacts between closely packed planetary embryos. Thus, the orbital distributions of planetary systems that is observed today, both solar and extrasolar, can be different from those emerging from formation and assembly processes within the disk, and it is important to consider possible long-term dynamics to connect the two.</description>

Abstract: Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program "AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks". The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.</description>

      <title>A candidate giant planet companion to the massive, young white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139 informs the occurrence of giant planets orbiting B stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that giant planet occurrence peaks for stars with $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ at a value a factor of 4 higher than observed for solar-mass stars. This population of giant planets predicted to frequently orbit main-sequence B stars at $a$ ~ 10au is difficult to characterize during the few hundred million years while fusion persists in their host stars. By the time those stars become massive, young white dwarfs, any giant planets present would still be luminous as a consequence of their recent formation. From an initial sample of 2195 Gaia-identified massive, young white dwarfs, we use homogeneous Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry to search for evidence of unresolved giant planets. For 30 systems, these IRAC data provide sensitivity to objects with $M~\lesssim$ 10 $M_{\text{Jup}}$, and we identify one candidate with ~ 4 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ orbiting the white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139. Correcting for the possibility that some of the white dwarfs in our sample result from mergers, we find a giant planet occurrence $\eta_{\text{GP}}~=~0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.13}$ for stars with initial masses $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$. Our occurrence inference is consistent with both the Doppler-inferred occurrence of giant planets orbiting 2 $M_{\odot}$ giant stars and the theoretically predicted factor of 4 enhancement in the occurrence of giant planets orbiting 3 $M_{\odot}$ stars relative to solar-mass stars. Future James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam observations of our sample would provide sensitivity to Saturn-mass planets and thereby a definitive estimate of the occurrence of giant planets orbiting stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Non-transiting exoplanets as a means of understanding star-planet interactions in close-in systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies showed evidence of a dearth of close-in exoplanets around fast rotators, which can be explained by the combined action of intense tidal and magnetic interactions between planets and their host star. Detecting more exoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short timescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. For this purpose, we performed a new search for close-in non-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital periods below 2.3 days. We focused on main-sequence solar-type stars and subgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star, we looked for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, which could correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We compared our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential contaminants in our sample, and we visually inspected the phase-folded light curve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars exhibiting a signature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar companion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the dearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems in order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Near-Earth Objects, Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a new 8m-class survey facility presently being commissioned in Chile, expected to begin the 10yr-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the end of 2025. Using the purpose-built Sorcha survey simulator (Merritt et al. In Press), and near-final observing cadence, we perform the first high-fidelity simulation of LSST's solar system catalog for key small body populations. We show that the final LSST catalog will deliver over 1.1 billion observations of small bodies and raise the number of known objects to 1.27E5 near-Earth objects, 5.09E6 main belt asteroids, 1.09E5 Jupiter Trojans, and 3.70E4 trans-Neptunian objects. These represent 4-9x more objects than are presently known in each class, making LSST the largest source of data for small body science in this and the following decade. We characterize the measurements available for these populations, including orbits, griz colors, and lightcurves, and point out science opportunities they open. Importantly, we show that ~70% of the main asteroid belt and more distant populations will be discovered in the first two years of the survey, making high-impact solar system science possible from very early on. We make our simulated LSST catalog publicly available, allowing researchers to test their methods on an up-to-date, representative, full-scale simulation of LSST data.</description>

      <title>Abundance Effects from Protoplanetary Disk Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Visual Binary TOI-6883AB and its dynamical implications for the planetary companion TOI-6883Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that TOI-6883 is a physically bound visual binary system composed of two solar-type stars, TOI-6883A (TIC 393818343) and TOI-6883B (TIC 393818340), initially regarded as a single star hosting the exoplanet TOI-6883b. Gaia DR3 astrometry shows that both stars have nearly identical parallaxes 10.6 mas, consistent proper motions, and a projected separation of 616 AU, confirming their binary nature. Using astrometric and photometric data, we estimate the stellar masses, physical separation, and an orbital period of 15,000 years. The system is energetically bound. We revise the planet designation to TOI-6883Ab to reflect stellar multiplicity. We evaluate the impact of the binary companion on planetary stability and find the planet's orbit to be long-term stable, although Kozai-Lidov perturbations remain possible. Further astrometric and photometric follow-up will be essential to better constrain the binary orbit and assess potential dynamical influences on the planetary architecture.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Smoothing of Directional and Axial Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
