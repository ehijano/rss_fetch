      <title>Probabilistic Fair Ordering of Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing class of applications depends on fair ordering, where events that occur earlier should be processed before later ones. Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons. Using this formulation, Tommy produces a partial order of events, achieving significantly better fairness than a Spanner TrueTime-based baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Harvest: Adaptive Photonic Switching Schedules for Collective Communication in Scale-up Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and energy efficiency, their circuit-switched nature raises a fundamental question for collective communication: when and how should the interconnect be reconfigured to realize these benefits? Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.
  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines.</description>

      <title>XLB: A High Performance Layer-7 Load Balancer for Microservices using eBPF-based In-kernel Interposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L7 load balancers are a fundamental building block in microservices as they enable fine-grained traffic distribution. Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.
  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency.</description>

      <title>QoS Identifier and Slice Mapping in 5G and Non-Terrestrial Network Interconnected Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interconnection of 5G and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) has been actively studied to expand connectivity beyond conventional terrestrial infrastructure. In the 3GPP standardization of 5G systems, the 5G Quality of Service (QoS) Identifier (5QI) is defined to characterize the QoS requirements of different traffic requirements. However, it falls short in capturing the diverse latency, capacity, and reliability profiles of NTN environments, particularly when NTNs are used as backhaul. Furthermore, it is difficult to manage individual traffic flows and perform efficient resource allocation and routing when a large number of 5G traffic flows are present in NTN systems. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization framework that enhances QoS handling by introducing an NTN QoS Identifier (NQI) and grouping 5G traffic into NTN slices based on similar requirements. This enables unified resource control and routing for a large number of 5G flows in NTN systems. In this paper, we present the detailed procedure of the proposed framework, which consists of 5QI to NQI mapping, NTN traffic to NTN slice mapping, and slice-level flow and routing optimization. We evaluate the framework by comparing multiple mapping schemes through numerical simulations and analyze their impact on overall network performance.</description>

      <title>ISO FastLane: Faster ISO 11783 with Dual Stack Approach as a Short Term Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agricultural industry has been searching for a high-speed successor to the 250~kbit/s CAN bus backbone of ISO~11783 (ISOBUS) for over a decade, yet no protocol-level solution has reached standardization. Meanwhile, modern planters, sprayers, and Virtual Terminals are already constrained by the bus bandwidth. This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks. This is delivering tangible performance gains today, without waiting for the long-term High Speed ISOBUS solution.</description>

      <title>Optimally Deployed Multistatic OTFS-ISAC Design With Kalman-Based Tracking of Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation aided multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks, whereby its delay-Doppler robustness is exploited for enhanced communication and high-resolution sensing. We present a triangulation-based deployment framework combined with Kalman filtering (KF) that enables accurate target localization and velocity estimation. In addition, we assess the ISAC performance in the multistatic topology to determine its effectiveness in the dynamic environment. Further, a suboptimal placement strategy for the multistatic receivers is devised to reduce the targets' localization error. Numerical results demonstrate significant reductions in the sensing error and bit error rate (BER) performances.</description>

      <title>6G NTN Waveforms: A Comparison of OTFS, AFDM and OCDM in LEO Satellite Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) physical layer (PHY) is evolving beyond the legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms. In this paper, we compare the bit error rate (BER) performance of three beyond-OFDM waveforms, namely, orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) modulation, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM), which are particularly suitable for the highly mobile non-terrestrial network (NTN) vertical of 6G. In order to characterize the effect of mobility and Doppler shift in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we performed BER comparisons over four different NTN tapped-delay-line (TDL) models, TDL-A, TDL-B, TDL-C, and TDL-D, as specified in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report TR 38.811. After channel equalization, a minimum mean squared error with successive detection (MMSE-SD) algorithm was used to enhance the BER performance. It was found that AFDM and OTFS consistently outperformed OCDM across all TDL models, while AFDM performed better than OTFS in TDL-B and TDL-C, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The complete simulation framework is made available as an open-source code for quick validation and further development.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Responsible AI-Stochastic Approach for SLA Compliance in Multivendor 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\%) and ERM (21.5\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Tracing Data Packet Paths over the Internet using Traceroute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network communication using the Internet Protocol (IP) is a pillar of modern Internet applications. IP allows data packets to travel the world through a complex set of interconnected computer networks managed by different operators. How IP-based data communication changes over time can be interesting from an end-system's perspective without relying on underlying network providers. This article presents an extensive, trace-driven analysis of user data traffic (covering five years of observations, six large Internet service providers (covering research, business and consumer category type), twenty autonomous systems, and fourteen countries.
  Our three primary findings are: i users data packet transmission paths are not deterministic and does not always select the geographically shortest path; ii) user packets take different routes that cover many countries and detour between two fixed points. Even after changing the types of Internet service provider type (e.g., from commercial to research), the routing can differ significantly between two locations. iii) Packet transmission delay can be influenced by changing the Internet service provider and IP protocol versions (i.e., from IPv4 to IPv6).</description>

      <title>SCOPE: A Training-Free Online 3D Deployment for UAV-BSs with Theoretical Analysis and Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted Base Stations (UAV-BSs) offer a flexible solution for serving ground users in temporary hotspot scenarios. However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.</description>

      <title>ORCHID: Fairness-Aware Orchestration in Mission-Critical Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of 6G Air-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for providing on-demand wireless coverage in mission-critical environments, such as post-disaster rescue operations. However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\&amp;F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Resilient Topology-Aware Coordination for Dynamic 3D UAV Networks under Node Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 3D Aerial-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), ensuring continuous service coverage under unexpected hardware failures is critical for mission-critical applications. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</description>

      <title>Framework for Integrating Zero Trust in Cloud-Based Endpoint Security for Critical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber threats have become highly sophisticated, prompting a heightened concern for endpoint security, especially in critical infrastructure, to new heights. A security model, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), is required to overcome this challenge. ZTA treats every access request as new and assumes no implicit trust. Critical infrastructure like power plants, healthcare systems, financial systems, water supply, and military assets are especially prone to becoming targets for hackers and phishing attacks. This proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating tailored ZTA into organizations that manage sensitive operations. The paper highlights how the ZTA framework can enhance compliance, enabling continuous protection, thereby reducing attack surfaces. This paper aims to address the gap that exists in applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments for critical infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: XMap is an open-source network scanner designed for performing fast Internet-wide IPv4 and IPv6 network research scanning. XMap was initially developed as the research artifact of a paper published at 2021 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN '21) and then made available on GitHub. XMap is the first tool to support fast Internet-wide IPv6 network scanning in 2020. During the last five years, XMap has made substantial impact in academia, industry, and government. It has been referenced in 52 research papers (15 published at top-tier security venues and 11 in leading networking societies), received over 450 GitHub stars, featured in multiple news outlets, and deployed or recommended by international companies up to date. Additionally, XMap has contributed to the implementation of RFC documents and the discovery of various vulnerabilities. This paper provides fundamental details about XMap, its architecture, and its impact.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-Age-Aware Scheduling in Quantum Repeater Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeater networks distribute entanglement over long distances but must balance fidelity, delay, and resource contention. Prior work optimized throughput and end-to-end fidelity, yet little attention has been paid to the freshness of entanglement-the time since a usable Bell pair was last delivered. We introduce the Fidelity-Age (FA) metric, which measures this interval for states whose fidelity exceeds a threshold Fmin. A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, approximate Lyapunov-drift-optimal control. Simulations on slotted repeater grids show that FA-aware scheduling preserves throughput while reducing extreme-age events by up to two orders of magnitude. Fidelity-Age thus provides a tractable, physically grounded metric for reliable and timely entanglement delivery in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Vehicular Multistatic OTFS-ISAC: A Geometry-Aware Deployment and Kalman-Based Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for next-generation vehicular networks, yet existing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based designs suffer from limited spatial diversity and severe sensitivity to Doppler and multipath effects. While orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers robustness under high mobility, the impact of spatial node deployment in multistatic OTFS-ISAC has remained largely unexplored. This paper presents the first geometry-aware multistatic OTFS-ISAC framework, in which a triangulation-based cooperative sensing approach is developed for joint target localization and velocity estimation. Closed-form expressions for the localization error covariance are derived under general receiver topologies, revealing that maximizing the triangulation area is fundamental to minimizing estimation error. This leads to a near-optimal deployment strategy based on orthogonal receiver placement and its equivalence to multi-antenna architectures with cubic-order error reduction. To enable reliable tracking of moving targets, a correlated random walk (CRW)-based Kalman filter (KF) framework is integrated into multistatic OTFS-ISAC for active sensing and ISAC. Numerical results demonstrate significant reductions in localization root-mean-square error (RMSE) and communication bit error rate (BER), highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-aware, KF-assisted multistatic OTFS-ISAC in dynamic vehicular environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) for Autonomous Operations in the Energy Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial automation in the energy sector requires AI systems that can operate autonomously regardless of network availability, a requirement that cloud-centric architectures cannot meet. This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.</description>

      <title>MonkeyTree: Near-Minimal Congestion for Multi-tenant Training via Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MonkeyTree, the first system to mitigate network congestion in multi-tenant GPU clusters through job-migration based defragmentation rather than network-layer techniques. As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying.
  MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.</description>

      <title>TURBO: Utility-Aware Bandwidth Allocation for Cloud-Augmented Autonomous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving system progress has been driven by improvements in machine learning models, whose computational demands now exceed what edge devices alone can provide. The cloud offers abundant compute, but the network has long been treated as an unreliable bottleneck rather than a co-equal part of the autonomous vehicle control loop. We argue that this separation is no longer tenable: safety-critical autonomy requires co-design of control, models, and network resource allocation itself.
  We introduce TURBO, a cloud-augmented control framework that addresses this challenge, formulating bandwidth allocation and control pipeline configuration across both the car and cloud as a joint optimization problem. TURBO maximizes benefit to the car while guaranteeing safety in the face of highly variable network conditions. We implement TURBO and evaluate it in both simulation and real-world deployment, showing it can improve average accuracy by up to 15.6%pt over existing on-vehicle-only pipelines. Our code is made available at www.github.com/NetSys/turbo.</description>

      <title>Neural Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a critical bottleneck in modern wireless networks, with pilot overhead consuming 11\% to 21\% of transmission bandwidth and feedback delays causing severe throughput degradation under mobility. Addressing this requires rethinking how neural fields represent coherent wave phenomena. This work introduces \textit{neural Gaussian radio fields (\textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF})}, a physics-informed framework that fundamentally reframes neural field design by replacing view-dependent rasterization with direct complex-valued aggregation in 3D space. This approach natively models wave superposition rather than visual occlusion. The architectural shift transforms the learning objective from function-fitting to source-recovery, a well-posed inverse problem grounded in electromagnetic theory. While demonstrated for wireless channel estimation, the core principle of explicit primitive-based fields with physics-constrained aggregation extends naturally to any coherent wave-based domain, including acoustic propagation, seismic imaging, and ultrasound reconstruction. Evaluations show that the inductive bias of \textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF} achieves 10.9 dB higher prediction SNR than state-of-the-art methods with 220$\times$ faster inference (1.1 ms vs. 242 ms), 18$\times$ lower measurement density, and 180$\times$ faster training. For large-scale outdoor environments where implicit methods fail, \textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF} achieves 28.32 dB SNR, demonstrating that structured representations supplemented by domain physics can fundamentally outperform generic deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Hazel: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern supercomputers and data center clusters, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce Hazel, a storage management system that extends the NVMe-oF protocol capabilities and adheres to the CC threat model, providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. Hazel offers an appropriate control path with novel concepts such as counter-leasing. Hazel also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata and introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), all while remaining compatible with NVMe-oF. For additional efficiency, Hazel also supports offloading to CC-capable smart NIC accelerators. We prototype Hazel on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate that it can achieve as little as 1-2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns, AI training, IO500, and YCSB.</description>
