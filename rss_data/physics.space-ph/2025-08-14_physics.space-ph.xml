      <title>Observational Constraints on the Radial Evolution of O$^{6+}$ Temperature and Differential Flow in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over decades of solar wind observations, heavy ions have been observed to have a higher temperature and flow faster than protons in the solar corona and heliosphere. Remote observations have largely been limited to the low corona ($&lt; 4R_{\odot}$), while in situ observations for heavy ions ($Z&gt;2$) have only been sampled at 1 au and beyond. As a result, theories that address heavy ion heating and acceleration remain largely unconstrained. With the launch of Solar Orbiter, heavy ion kinetics can be probed closer to the Sun, as close as the orbit of Mercury ($65R_{\odot}$), to examine their radial behavior. Through a statistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study finds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfv\'en speed, and its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the Sun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a single temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there is no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast to what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfv\'enic fluctuations, with full 180$^{\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential streaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons. The amount of negative differential streaming gradually increases at larger distances. These results provide critical constraints to the proposed mechanisms seeking to describe ion heating and acceleration in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Whistler Chorus Amplification in the Magnetosphere: The Nonlinear Free-Electron Laser Model and the Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel nonlinear model for whistler-mode chorus amplification based on the free-electron laser (FEL) mechanism. First, we derive the nonlinear collective variable equations for the whistler-electron interaction. Consistent with in situ satellite observations, these equations predict that a small seed wave can undergo exponential growth, reaching a peak of a few hundred picoteslas after a few milliseconds, followed by millisecond timescale amplitude modulations. Next, we show that when one accounts for multiple wave frequencies and wave spatial variations, the amplitude and phase of the whistler wave can be described by the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), providing a framework for the investigation of solitary wave behavior of chorus modes. These findings enhance our understanding of wave-particle interactions and space weather in the Van Allen radiation belts, deepen the connection between whistler-electron dynamics and FELs, and reveal a novel connection between whistler-mode chorus and the GLE.</description>

      <title>An interstellar mission to test astrophysical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send a small spacecraft to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that might be difficult to obtain in other ways.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Electron Heating in Electron-Only Reconnection in a Laboratory Mini-Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of electron heating in electron-only magnetic reconnection in laser-driven laboratory mini-magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.</description>
