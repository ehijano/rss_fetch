      <title>Metric Entropy of Ellipsoids in Banach Spaces: Techniques and Precise Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new techniques for computing the metric entropy of ellipsoids -- with polynomially decaying semi-axes -- in Banach spaces. Besides leading to a unified and comprehensive framework, these tools deliver numerous novel results as well as substantial improvements and generalizations of classical results. Specifically, we characterize the constant in the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the metric entropy of $p$-ellipsoids with respect to $q$-norm, for arbitrary $p,q \in [1, \infty]$, to date known only in the case $p=q=2$. Moreover, for $p=q=2$, we improve upon classical results by specifying the second-order term in the asymptotic expansion. In the case $p=q=\infty$, we obtain a complete, as opposed to asymptotic, characterization of metric entropy and explicitly construct optimal coverings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact characterization of the metric entropy of an infinite-dimensional body. Application of our general results to function classes yields an improvement of the asymptotic expansion of the metric entropy of unit balls in Sobolev spaces and identifies the dependency of the metric entropy of unit balls in Besov spaces on the domain of the functions in the class. Sharp results on the metric entropy of function classes find application, e.g., in machine learning, where they allow to specify the minimum required size of deep neural networks for function approximation, nonparametric regression, and classification over these function classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present refined general weighted $L^{p}$-Hardy type inequalities and identities with explicit remainder terms associated with Baouendi-Grushin vector fields, thereby improving previously known results. Furthermore, we obtain the corresponding general weighted Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with remainder terms, which, as a result, imply Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Filtering of second order generalized stochastic processes corrupted by additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat the optimal linear filtering problem for a sum of two second order uncorrelated generalized stochastic processes. This is an operator equation involving covariance operators. We study both the wide-sense stationary case and the non-stationary case. In the former case the equation simplifies into a convolution equation. The solution is the Radon--Nikodym derivative between non-negative tempered Radon measures, for signal and signal plus noise respectively, in the frequency domain. In the non-stationary case we work with pseudodifferential operators with symbols in Sj\"ostrand modulation spaces which admits the use of its spectral invariance properties.</description>

      <title>Heat kernels, intrinsic contractivity and ergodicity of discrete-time Markov chains killed by potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov chains on countably infinite state spaces, which are perturbed by rather general confining (i.e.\ growing at infinity) potentials. Using a discrete-time analogue of the classical Feynman--Kac formula, we obtain two-sided estimates for the $n$-step heat kernels $u_n(x,y)$ of the perturbed chain. These estimates are of the form $u_n(x,y)\asymp \lambda_0^n\phi_0(x)\widehat\phi_0(y)+F_n(x,y)$, where $\phi_0$ (and $\widehat\phi_0$) are the (dual) eigenfunctions for the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$; the perturbation $F_n(x,y)$ is explicitly given, and it vanishes if either $x$ or $y$ is in a bounded set. The key assumptions are that the chain is uniformly lazy and that the \enquote{direct step property} (DSP) is satisfied. This means that the chain is more likely to move from state $x$ to state $y$ in a single step rather than in two or more steps. Starting from the form of the heat kernel estimate, we define the intrinsic (or ground-state transformed) chains and we introduce time-dependent ultracontractivity notions -- asymptotic and progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity -- which we can link to the growth behaviour of the confining potential; this allows us to consider arbitrarily slow growing potentials. These new notions of ultracontractivity also lead to a characterization of uniform (quasi-)ergodicity of the perturbed and the ground-state transformed Markov chains. At the end of the paper, we give various examples that illustrate how our findings relate to existing models, e.g.\ nearest-neighbour walks on infinite graphs, subordinate processes or non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators by Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Operator-valued Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for estimating nonlinear operators from a Polish space to a separable Hilbert space. We assume that the regression operator lies in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued kernel. Two significant settings are considered: an online setting with polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, and a finite-horizon setting with constant step sizes and regularization parameters. We introduce regularity conditions on the structure and smoothness of the target operator and the input random variables. Under these conditions, we provide a dimension-free convergence analysis for the prediction and estimation errors, deriving both expectation and high-probability error bounds. Our analysis demonstrates that these convergence rates are nearly optimal. Furthermore, we present a new technique for deriving bounds with high probability for general SGD schemes, which also ensures almost-sure convergence. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to more general operator-valued kernels and the encoder-decoder framework.</description>

      <title>On the Excess Charge Problem of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes new bounds on the maximum number of electrons $ N_c(Z) $ that an atom with nuclear charge $Z$ can bind. Specifically, we show that \begin{equation*}
  N_c(Z) &lt; 1.1185Z + O(Z^{1/3}) \end{equation*} with an explicit bound on the lower order term $O(Z^{1/3})$. This result improves long--standing bounds by Lieb and Nam obtained in 1984, respectively 2012. Our bounds show the fundamental difference between fermionic and bosonic atoms for finite $Z$ since for bosonic atoms it is known that $\lim N_c(Z)/Z = t_c \approx 1.21$ in the limit of large nuclear charges $Z$.</description>

      <title>Density of irreducible operators in the trace-class norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1968, Paul Halmos initiated the research on density of the set of irreducible operators on a separable Hilbert space. Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\Vert K \Vert_1 &lt; \varepsilon$?
  For $p&gt;1$, to prove the $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.
  In the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras. Moreover, we discover that there is a strong connection between the problem and another related operator-theoretical problem related to type $\mathrm{II}_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>
