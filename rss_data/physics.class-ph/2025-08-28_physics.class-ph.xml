      <title>SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations, causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation, rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution. Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be valid in extracting the comb.</description>

      <title>Stress Analysis of a Square Elastic Body Under Biaxial Loading Using Airy Stress Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analytical investigation of stress distributions in square-shaped elastic bodies subjected to concentrated compressive loads under uniaxial and biaxial conditions. By employing the Airy stress function method, we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain. The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case, the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios, producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on the location within the domain.</description>

      <title>A strategy with reduced models dedicated to parametrized nonlinear strongly coupled thermo-poroelasticity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers an approach to deal with parametrized nonlinear strongly coupled thermo-poroelasticity problems. The approach uses the LATIN-PGD method and extends previous work in multiphysics problems. Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) allows the building of independent reduced-order bases for each physics. This point is particularly appropriate for thermo-poroelasticity problems whose physics present different dynamics. In parametrized problems dealing with material variability, a new computation is initialized with the result of a previous simulation to speed up the computation times. As a first step, the solver is validated on a standard benchmark in thermo-poroelasticity. The solver shows good performance even in the nonlinear frame. Then, the approach for parametrized problems is addressed on an academic problem and a more complex one, which is part of an industrial process. The results show that the method is effective and less time-consuming than naive approaches.</description>

      <title>Effective potential of a spinning heavy symmetric top when magnitudes of conserved angular momenta are not equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.06168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various types of motion of a heavy symmetric top like regular precession, cusp like motion, rise of the top, etc. One of the tools used to understand that motion is effective potential. The effective potential for a spinning heavy symmetric top is studied when magnitudes of conserved angular momenta are not equal to each other. The dependence of effective potential on conserved angular momenta is analyzed. This study shows that the minimum of effective potential goes to a constant derived from conserved angular momenta when one of the conserved angular momenta is greater than the other one, and it goes to infinity when the other one is greater. It also shows that the usage of strong or weak top separation does not work adequately in all cases.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics in Matter from First Principles: A Unified and Consistent Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a century, the electrodynamics of material media has been characterized by competing formulations, persistent paradoxes, and a fundamental lack of consensus on force and energy. This manuscript demonstrates that these long-standing challenges are not a sign of intrinsic ambiguity in the laws of physics, but are the direct consequence of historical and pedagogical models becoming disconnected from a foundational principle of mechanics. The resolution begins with the axiom that a physical force must act upon a well-defined mass. From this single principle, a rigorous Force-Energy Consistency Criterion is derived. When applied as a diagnostic tool, this criterion reveals a shared foundational inconsistency in the mechanical structure of the seminal formulations of Minkowski, Abraham, and conventional textbook approaches: their postulated forces are shown to be irreconcilable with their own descriptions of energy conversion. The analysis is completed by proving a profound epistemological limit inherent in any macroscopic theory: the indeterminacy of the local force density. This result reframes the historical search for a unique force law as an ill-posed question. By demanding mechanical consistency and respecting this fundamental limit, the ambiguity that has plagued the field is resolved. A single, unique framework emerges not as a choice, but as a necessary logical conclusion: the universal vacuum-form energy-momentum tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}_{EM}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$) and the total Lorentz force. This work establishes this framework as the sole description consistent with determinable physics and formally separates it from the distinct task of building pragmatic models to estimate the unknowable internal forces. The result is a complete, consistent, and methodologically sound restoration of the electrodynamics of matter.</description>

      <title>An alternative interpretation of the Grioli gyroscope suspension points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of all possible regular precessions of a heavy asymmetric body with a fixed point not coinciding with the center of mass. The calculations are done in terms of the rotation matrix, by writing the Euler-Poisson equations with all involved vectors parameterized in the Laboratory frame. It is shown that a regular precession is possible if the suspension point is chosen on the straight lines (lying in the principal plane) which are frontiers of the regions where, as the distance from the center of mass increases, the interchange of the intermediate and largest moments of inertia occurs. Like the spin of an electron in quantum mechanics, the frequency of regular precession in classical mechanics turns out to be rigidly fixed by two values, i.e., quantized.</description>
