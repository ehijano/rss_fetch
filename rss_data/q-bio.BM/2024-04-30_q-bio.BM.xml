      <title>Deep Lead Optimization: Leveraging Generative AI for Structural Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of using deep-learning-based molecular generation to accelerate discovery of drug candidates has attracted extraordinary attention, and many deep generative models have been developed for automated drug design, termed molecular generation. In general, molecular generation encompasses two main strategies: de novo design, which generates novel molecular structures from scratch, and lead optimization, which refines existing molecules into drug candidates. Among them, lead optimization plays an important role in real-world drug design. For example, it can enable the development of me-better drugs that are chemically distinct yet more effective than the original drugs. It can also facilitate fragment-based drug design, transforming virtual-screened small ligands with low affinity into first-in-class medicines. Despite its importance, automated lead optimization remains underexplored compared to the well-established de novo generative models, due to its reliance on complex biological and chemical knowledge. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic review of traditional computational methods for lead optimization, organizing these strategies into four principal sub-tasks with defined inputs and outputs. This review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD techniques, and recent advancements in AIDD. Additionally, we introduce a unified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the methodologies of de novo design and lead optimization. Through this lens, de novo design can incorporate strategies from lead optimization to address the challenge of generating hard-to-synthesize molecules; inversely, lead optimization can benefit from the innovations in de novo design by approaching it as a task of generating molecules conditioned on certain substructures.</description>

      <title>Mixed Continuous and Categorical Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models that produce novel molecular structures have the potential to facilitate chemical discovery. Diffusion models currently achieve state of the art performance for 3D molecule generation. In this work, we explore the use of flow matching, a recently proposed generative modeling framework that generalizes diffusion models, for the task of de novo molecule generation. Flow matching provides flexibility in model design; however, the framework is predicated on the assumption of continuously-valued data. 3D de novo molecule generation requires jointly sampling continuous and categorical variables such as atom position and atom type. We extend the flow matching framework to categorical data by constructing flows that are constrained to exist on a continuous representation of categorical data known as the probability simplex. We call this extension SimplexFlow. We explore the use of SimplexFlow for de novo molecule generation. However, we find that, in practice, a simpler approach that makes no accommodations for the categorical nature of the data yields equivalent or superior performance. As a result of these experiments, we present FlowMol, a flow matching model for 3D de novo generative model that achieves improved performance over prior flow matching methods, and we raise important questions about the design of prior distributions for achieving strong performance in flow matching models. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available at https://github.com/dunni3/FlowMol</description>
