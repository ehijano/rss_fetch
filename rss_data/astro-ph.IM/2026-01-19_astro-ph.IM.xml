      <description>arXiv:2601.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory (GRAO) marks a pivotal advance in African radio astronomy through the successful transformation of a decommissioned 32 m satellite communication antenna into a scientifically capable, VLBI-ready radio telescope. Strategically located near the equator at Kutunse, Ghana, the telescope offers nearly full-sky coverage (-77 degrees to +88 degrees declination), making it a valuable asset for time-domain astronomy, transient surveys, and global VLBI networks. This work documents the technical evolution of the facility, including beam-waveguide optics, dual-polarization C-band receivers (5 and 6.7 GHz), and recent backend upgrades culminating in the integration of a hydrogen maser, wideband ROACH2 system, and enhanced control and pointing infrastructure. We report early science results from high-resolution spectral-line observations of 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers, pulse timing of PSR J0835-4510 (Vela), and successful VLBI fringe detections on intercontinental baselines. Simulations and commissioning tests confirm high aperture efficiency (&gt;77%), low sidelobe levels, and robust time stability across the signal chain. These outcomes validate the GRAO's readiness for both standalone and networked operations. As the first operational node in West Africa contributing to the African VLBI Network, GRAO plays a critical role in advancing the continent's participation in global radio astronomy, capacity building, and the preparatory phase of the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the Effects of Spectroscopic Training Set Imperfection on Photometric Redshift Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most LSST extragalactic science will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) to extract distance information for the galaxies. However, an incomplete or non-representative training set can introduce bias into photo-$z$ estimation. It is necessary to understand how various forms of training set imperfection, such as incompleteness and non-trivial spectroscopic target selection, affect photo-$z$ estimation algorithms, and to identify metrics best-suited to quantify the impact. This work aims to systematically study metrics for diagnosing how various photo-$z$ methods react to certain types of training set incompleteness and non-representativeness. We use methods available through the open-source Python library Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) to systematically test the algorithms CMNN, GPz, FlexZBoost, and PZFlow on mock training data degraded in accordance with several existing spectroscopic sky surveys, as well as under conditions of inverse redshift incompleteness, which approximately mimics observed patterns of incompleteness at high redshift. We employ the algorithm TrainZ as a control. Finally, we quantify photo-$z$ algorithm performance using a variety of statistical metrics implemented externally to RAIL. We determine that the Kullback-Liebler Divergence, Wasserstein Distance, and Probability Integral Transform are particularly informative metrics with which to assess the impact of training set imperfection on algorithmic performance. We also find that inverse redshift incompleteness effects alone lack the complexity to realistically represent anticipated training data.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Unbiased Fluxes from Up-the-Ramp Detectors under Variable Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) detectors -- which use non-destructive readouts to measure time-series counts-per-pixel -- play a crucial role in modern astrophysics. Standard NIR flux extraction techniques were developed for space-based observations and assume that source fluxes are constant over an observation. However, ground-based telescopes often see short-timescale atmospheric variations that can dramatically change the number of photons arriving at a pixel. This work presents a new statistical model that shares information between neighboring spectral pixels to characterize time-variable observations and extract unbiased fluxes with optimal uncertainties. We generate realistic synthetic data using a variety of flux and amplitude-of-time-variability conditions to confirm that our model recovers unbiased and optimal estimates of both the true flux and the time-variable signal. We find that the time-variable model should be favored over a constant-flux model when the observed count rates change by more than 3.5%. Ignoring time variability in the data can result in flux-dependent, unknown-sign biases that are as large as ~120% of the flux uncertainty. Using real APOGEE spectra, we find empirical evidence for approximately wavelength-independent, time-dependent variations in count rates with amplitudes much greater than the 3.5% threshold. Our model can robustly measure and remove the time-dependence in real data, improving the quality of data-model comparison. We show several examples where the observed time-dependence quantitatively agrees with independent measurements of observing conditions, such as variable cloud cover and seeing.</description>

      <title>A Novel, Beam-based Formalism for Active Impedance of Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active impedance is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the behavior of large, uniform phased array antennas. However, its conventional calculation via the mutual impedance matrix (or the scattering matrix) offers limited physical intuition and can be computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel derivation of the active impedance directly from the radiated beam pattern of such arrays. This approach maps the scan-angle variation of the active impedance directly to the intrinsic angular variation of the beam, providing a more intuitive physical interpretation. The theoretical derivation is straightforward and rigorous. The validity of the proposed equation is conclusively confirmed through full-wave simulations of a prototype array. This work establishes a new and more intuitive framework for understanding, analyzing and accurately measuring the scan-dependent variations in phased arrays, which is one of the main challenges in modern phased array designs. Consequently, this novel formalism is expected to expedite and simplify the overall design and optimization process for next-generation, large-scale uniform phased arrays.</description>

      <title>The test and calibration system for the Elementary Cells of the Cherenkov Camera in the PBR Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of detectors using Silicon Photo-Multipliers for acquisition of fast light signals coming from Cherenkov and fluorescence emissions started by particle showers in the terrestrial atmosphere is the main goal of the Italian ASI/INFN Agreement n.2021-8-HH.2-2022, named "ASI/INFN_EUSO-SPB2", in view of the next generation of telescopes in balloon-borne and space-based experiments. A survey of performances of different Silicon Photo-Multipliers available on the market has been performed to identify the best sensors for space applications, where high thermal excursions and environmental radiation must be mainly taken into account in contrast to ground-based experiments. In particular, a characterization protocol for Silicon Photo-Multiplier qualification has been specified to Hamamatsu S13161-3050AE-08 sensor ($8 \times 8$) array in the $30 \, \textrm{C}^{\circ}$ down to $-40 \, \textrm{C}^{\circ}$ temperature range. The protocol specifies measurements of break-down voltage, quenching resistance, gain, dark count rate and the probability of cross-talk. These parameters have been measured as a function of temperature at fixed over-voltage. Based on these previous measurements, a dedicated set-up is under completion for performing massive tests to validate and calibrate 32 Silicon Photo-Multipliers (Hamamatsu S13361-3050 series, 64 channels each), composing the (2048 pixels, $12^{\circ} \times 6^{\circ}$ field of view) Focal Surface of the Cherenkov Camera that will fly on the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio mission. The technical details and description of this system and the procedural steps implemented are reported, preliminary measurements on the first Elementary Cell are also shown.</description>

      <title>Mobile Intensity Interferometer for Stellar Observations (MI$^2$SO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, intensity interferometry has seen renewed interest and successful application at Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope arrays. These measurements are usually performed during bright moon periods while the instruments' primary purpose -- gamma-ray observations -- cannot be fulfilled. The Mobile Intensity Interferometer for Stellar Observations was designed as a proof of concept for a purpose-built intensity interferometer. Using acrylic Fresnel lenses 1 m in diameter with 1.2 m focal length, a compact, economical and lightweight design was realised. The detector fixture allows for translation in the z-axis to adjust for measurements at different wavelengths (and therefore focal points) and easy swapping of the detector in its entirety. Both mobility and scalability in quantity of this design allow for specific targeting of projected baselines and orientations based on the target. Particularly for potential binary systems, selective coverage of a target's u-v plane is essential to probing the characteristics accurately. A first campaign demonstrated the capability of these Fresnel lens telescopes by measuring the spatial coherence curve of Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo). In an observation time of less than 11 h, the angular diameter was measured with milliarcsecond precision, in agreement with the values in the literature.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</description>

      <title>Five Years of Mini-EUSO Observations from the ISS: Summary of Key Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini-EUSO is the first space-borne detector of the JEM-EUSO (Joint Exploratory Missions for Extreme Universe Space Observatory) program, operating on the International Space Station (ISS) since October 2019. Designed to search for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above 10$^{21}~$eV and capable of placing a stringent upper limit on their flux at these extreme energies, paving the way to future space-based UHECR observatories, Mini-EUSO has completed more than 150 observation sessions over five years, accumulating approximately 750 hours of data. The mission has produced the first global UV emission maps of Earth and provided valuable insights into lightning phenomena and Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), such as elves, as well as artificial light sources and meteors. Notably, Mini-EUSO has conducted the first systematic space-based meteor survey, detecting over 22,000 meteors and identifying three interstellar candidates. Among the observed TLEs, the most interesting class of phenomena are elves, which appear as expanding ring-shaped structures occurring at $\sim$90 km altitude. Mini-EUSO has detected elves with varying structures and different numbers of concentric rings, from single-ring up to five rings. Thanks to its imaging capabilities, fast time resolution, and favorable observational geometry, Mini-EUSO is uniquely suited to studying this kind of lightning phenomena, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamics. Additionally, the instrument has demonstrated the capability of a space-based detector to identify short light transients resembling extensive air shower signals while distinguishing them from those produced by UHECRs. This contribution presents a comprehensive summary of the Mini-EUSO mission, its status, and main results.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Galaxy SED reconstruction in the PHZ processing function: impact on the PSF and the role of medium-band filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys require accurate correction for the point spread function (PSF) when measuring galaxy shapes. For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Search with 7.8 Tonne-Year of Ionization-Only Data in XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a blinded search for dark matter (DM) using ionization-only (S2-only) signals in XENONnT with a total exposure of $7.83\mathrm{tonne}\times\mathrm{year}$ over 579 days in three science runs. Dedicated background suppression techniques and the first complete S2-only background model in XENONnT provide sensitivity to nuclear recoils of [0.5, 5.0] $\mathrm{keV_\mathrm{nr}}$ and electronic recoils of [0.04, 0.7] $\mathrm{keV_\mathrm{ee}}$. No significant excess over the expected background is observed, and we set 90\% confidence level upper limits on spin-independent DM--nucleon and spin-dependent DM--neutron scattering for DM masses between 3 and 8 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, as well as on DM--electron scattering, axion-like particles, and dark photons, improving on previous constraints. For spin-independent DM--nucleon scattering, we exclude cross sections above $6.0\times10^{-45} $cm$^2$ at a DM mass of 5 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, pushing the XENONnT sensitivity closer to the region where coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\text{CE}\nu\text{NS}$) becomes an irreducible background.</description>

      <title>Dual-Backend Multibeam Position Switching Targeted SETI Observations toward Nearby Active Planet-Hosting Systems with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within diversified drift rate ranges and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10% and 50%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.</description>

      <title>Simulating Image Coaddition with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. IV. Hyperparameter Optimization and Experimental Features</title>

Abstract: For weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, image coaddition, or construction of oversampled images from undersampled ones, is a critical step in the image processing pipeline. In the previous papers in this series, we have re-implemented the {\sc Imcom} algorithm, which offers control over point spread functions in coadded images, and applied it to state-of-the-art image simulations for Roman. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of {\sc Imcom} hyperparameters on the quality of measurement results. We re-coadd the same $16$ blocks ($1.75 \times 1.75 \,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $2688 \times 2688$ pixels each) from OpenUniverse2024 simulations with $26$ different configurations in each of $5$ bands. We then compare the results in terms of $12$ objective evaluation criteria, including internal diagnostics of {\sc Imcom}, properties of coadded noise frames, measurements of injected point sources, and time consumption. We demonstrate that: i) the Cholesky kernel is the best known linear algebra strategy for {\sc Imcom}, ii) for our measurements, a wide Gaussian target output PSF outperforms a smoothed Airy disk or a narrow Gaussian, iii) kernel-specific settings are worth considering for future coaddition, and iv) {\sc Imcom} experimental features studied in this work are either inconsequential or detrimental. We end this paper by discussing current and next steps of {\sc Imcom}-related studies in the context of Roman shear and clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983</link>

Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise in space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA. However, current second-generation TDI schemes often exhibit undesirable null frequencies and require long delay spans, which can impair data analysis performance. In this work, we introduce an alternative TDI configuration PD4L designed to minimize null frequencies and operate with a shorter effective time span. Constructed by synthesizing two distinct first-generation TDI schemes, PD4L achieves a delay span of 4$L$ (where $L$ is the arm length), half that of the standard Michelson and hybrid Relay configurations. We assess PD4L's performance by evaluating the spectral stability of instrumental noise via arm-length derivatives, simulating chirping GW signals from coalescing massive black hole binaries, and comparing waveform responses. Parameter estimation is performed in the frequency domain, and noise characterization is examined under realistic orbital dynamics. As demonstrated by the comparisons, the compact structure of PD4L offers several advantages: (1) reduced data margins at segment boundaries, (2) mitigated aliasing effects in the high-frequency regime, and (3) shortened signal tails arising from extended delay spans. Additionally, PD4L's null channels exhibit the same minimal null frequencies as its science channels, while maintaining greater spectral stability than other null streams. Overall, PD4L improves parameter estimation accuracy at high frequencies and supports reliable noise characterization over observation periods of up to four months. These results highlight PD4L as a compact and effective alternative for future TDI implementations, especially in high-frequency GW data analysis for LISA-like missions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Photometry for Deconfusion of Directly Imaged Multi-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will aim to image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which detection corresponds to which planet. This "confusion" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics. We address the planet-detection confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking scheme to augment a "deconfuser" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by planets throughout their orbits. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme as a proof-of-concept on a subset of highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). We find that incorporating photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in more than half of these particularly challenging cases. These results emphasize that photometry is useful for orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.</description>
