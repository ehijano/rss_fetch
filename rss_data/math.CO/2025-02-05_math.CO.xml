      <title>Incidence Gain Graphs and Generalized Quadrangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a construction method based on a gain function that is defined on the incidence graph of an incidence geometry. Restricting to when the incidence geometry is a linear space, we show that the construction yields a generalized quadrangle provided that the gain function satisfies a certain bijective property. Our method is valid for finite and infinite geometries. We produce a family of generalized quadrangles by defining such a gain function on an affine plane over an arbitrary field.</description>

      <title>The spectral degree exponent of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the spectral degree exponent as a novel graph metric. Although Hofmeister \cite{HofmeisterThesis} has studied the same metric, we generalise Hofmeister's work to weighted graphs. We provide efficient iterative formulas and bounds for the spectral degree exponent and provide highly accurate asymptotic expansions for the spectral degree exponent for several families of graphs. Furthermore, we uncover a close relation between the spectral degree exponent and the well-known degree assortativity, by showing high correlations between the two metrics in all small graphs, several random graph models and many real-world graphs.</description>

      <title>On a formula of the $q$-series $_{2k+4}\phi_{2k+3}$ and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply a formula of the very-well poised $_{2k+4}\phi_{2k+3}$ to write a $k$-tuple sum of $q$-series as a linear combination of terms wherein each term is a product of expressions of the form $\frac{1}{(qy, qy^{-1};q)_\infty}$. As an application, we shall express a variety of sums and double sums of $q$-series as linear combinations of infinite products. Our formulas are motivated by their connection to overpartition pairs.</description>

      <title>Determining inscribability of polytopes via rank minimization based on slack matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polytope is inscribable if there is a realization where all vertices lie on the sphere. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a polytope to be inscribable. Based on this condition, we characterize the problem of determining inscribability as a minimum rank optimization problem using slack matrices. We propose an SDP approximation for the minimum rank optimization problem and prove that it is tight for certain classes of polytopes. Given a polytope, we provide three algorithms to determine its inscribability. All the optimization problems and algorithms we propose in this paper depend on the number of vertices and facets but are independent of the dimension of the polytope. Numerical results demonstrate our SDP approximation's efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for determining inscribability of simplicial polytopes of dimensions $4\le d\le 8$ with vertices $n\le 10$, revealing its potential in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Short Paths in the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem of Dujmovi\'c et al. [J. ACM '20] says that every planar graph $G$ is contained in $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_3$ for some planar graph $H$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $P$. This result has been the key to solving several old open problems. Several people have asked whether the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem can be proved with good upper bounds on the length of $P$. No $o(n)$ upper bound was previously known for $n$-vertex planar graphs. We answer this question in the affirmative, by proving that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_{O(1/\epsilon)}$, for some planar graph $H$ with treewidth 3 and for some path $P$ of length $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}n^{(1+\epsilon)/2})$. This bound is almost tight since there is a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ for certain $n$-vertex planar graphs. In fact, we prove a stronger result with $P$ of length $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\,\textrm{tw}(G)\,n^{\epsilon})$, which is tight up to the $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\,n^{\epsilon})$ factor for every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$. Finally, taking $\epsilon=\frac{1}{\log n}$, we show that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ is contained in $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_{O(\log n)}$ for some planar graph $H$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $P$ of length $O(\textrm{tw}(G)\,\log n)$. This result is particularly attractive since the treewidth of the product $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_{O(\log n)}$ is within a $O(\log^2n)$ factor of the treewidth of $G$.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic number of the plane for map-type colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hadwiger-Nelson problem on the chromatic number of the plane under conditions of coloring a map containing a finite number of vertices in any bounded region. Woodall (1973) and Townsend (1981) showed that at least 6 colors would be required. In the present paper, it is shown that at least 7 colors are required to color a map in which the boundaries are not arcs of a unit circle and three boundaries connect at each vertex. As a corollary, we obtain that at least 7 colors are required for a proper coloring in which the regions are arbitrary polygons. The proof relies on techniques developed for a similar result concerning the chromatic number of the plane with a forbidden interval of distances.</description>

      <title>Number of spanning trees in a wheel graph with two identified vertices via hitting times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an exact formula for the average hitting times in a wheel graph $W_{N+1}$ using a combinatorial approach. For this wheel graph, the average hitting times can be expressed using Fibonacci numbers when the number of surrounding vertices is odd and Lucas numbers when it is even. Furthermore, combining the exact formula for the average hitting times with the general formula for the effective resistance of the graph allows determination of the number of spanning trees of the graph with two identified vertices.</description>

      <title>Parking Spaces for Complex Reflection Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer an open problem of arXiv:1204.1760 and arXiv:1205.4293, extending their work to irreducible well--generated complex reflection groups $W$. We define a combinatorial $W$-noncrossing parking space and an algebraic $W$-parking space for such $W$, and exhibit a $(W \times C)$-equivariant isomorphism between the two. As a consequence of this isomorphism, we enumerate the $W$-noncrossing parking functions. Finally, we extend our results to the Fuss case. We prove the results for all such complex reflection groups except $G_{34}$, $E_7,$ and $E_8$.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Ordered Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ordered Ramsey number of a graph $G^&lt;$ with a linearly ordered vertex set is the smallest positive integer $N$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the ordered complete graph on $N$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $G^&lt;$ in the given ordering. The study of the quantitative behavior of ordered Ramsey numbers is a relatively new theme in Ramsey theory full of interesting and difficult problems.
  In this survey paper, we summarize recent developments in the theory of ordered Ramsey numbers. We point out connections to other areas of combinatorics and some well-known conjectures. We also list several new and challenging open problems and highlight the often strikingly different behavior from the unordered case.</description>

      <title>Ovoids of $Q^+(7,q)$ of low-degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ovoids of the hyperbolic quadric $Q^+(7,q)$ of $\mathrm{PG}(7,q)$ have been extensively studied over the past 40 years, partly due to their connections with other combinatorial objects. It is well known that the points of an ovoid of $Q^+(7,q)$ can be parametrized by three polynomials $f_1(X,Y,Z)$, $f_2(X,Y,Z)$, $f_3(X,Y,Z)$. In this paper, we classify ovoids of $Q^+(7,q)$ of low degree, specifically under the assumption that $f_1(X,Y,Z)$, $f_2(X,Y,Z)$, $f_3(X,Y,Z)$ have degree at most 3. Our approach relies on the analysis of an algebraic hypersurface associated with the ovoid.</description>

      <title>Edge-transitive cubic graphs: Cataloguing and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with finite cubic ($3$-regular) graphs whose automorphism group acts transitively on the edges of the graph. Such graphs split into two broad classes, namely arc-transitive and semisymmetric cubic graphs, and then these divide respectively into $7$ types (according to a classification by Djokovi\'c and Miller (1980)) and $15$ types (according to a classification by Goldschmidt(1980)), in terms of certain group amalgams. Such graphs of small order were previously known up to orders $2048$ and $768$, respectively, and we have extended each of the two lists of all such graphs up to order $10000$. Before describing how we did that, we carry out an analysis of the $22$ amalgams, to show which of the finitely-presented groups associated with the $15$ Goldschmidt amalgams can be faithfully embedded in one or more of the other $21$ (as subgroups of finite index), complementing what is already known about such embeddings of the $7$ Djokovi\'c-Miller groups in each other. We also give an example of a graph of each of the $22$ types, and in most cases, describe the smallest such graph, and we then use regular coverings to prove that there are infinitely many examples of each type. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic enumeration of the graph orders, proving that if $f_{\mathcal C}(n)$ is the number of cubic edge-transitive graphs of type ${\mathcal C}$ on at most $n$ vertices, then there exist positive real constants $a$ and $b$ and a positive integer $n_0$ such that $n^{a \log(n)} \le f_{\mathcal C}(n) \le n^{b \log(n)}$ for all $\ n\ge n_0$.</description>

      <title>The major index (maj) and its Sch\"utzenberger dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a bijective proof of the Stanley formula for the generating function of the Semistandard Young Tableaux (SsYT) of skew shape {\lambda}/{\mu}. To do this we define for every SsYT T its plinth, p(T), which is a SsYT of the same shape {\lambda}/{\mu}. The set of plinths is finite. Our bijection associates to every SsYT T a pair (p(T),Y(T-p(T))), where Y(T-p(T)) is the reading Young diagram of the SsYT T-p(T). In particular, every Standard Young Tableau (SYT) P has its plinth, p(P). The two statistics of SYT-s -- the volume |p(P)| and maj(P) -- are related via the Sch\"utzenberger involution Sch:
  |p(P)|=maj(Sch(P)).</description>

      <title>Hyperpolygonal arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss introduced a particular family of real hyperplane arrangements stemming from hyperpolygonal spaces associated with certain quiver varieties which we thus call hyperpolygonal arrangements $\mathcal H_n$. In this note we study these arrangements and investigate their properties systematically. Remarkably the arrangements $\mathcal H_n$ discriminate between essentially all local properties of arrangements. In addition we show that hyperpolygonal arrangements are projectively unique and combinatorially formal.
  We note that the arrangement $\mathcal H_5$ is the famous counterexample of Edelman and Reiner from 1993 of Orlik's conjecture that the restriction of a free arrangement is again free.</description>

      <title>Minimal codes from hypersurfaces in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The setting of projective systems can be used to study the parameters of a projective linear code $\mathcal{C}$ by considering the intersections of the point set $\Omega$ defined by the columns of a generating matrix for $\mathcal{C}$ with the hyperplanes of a projective space. In particular, $\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\Omega$ is cutting, i.e. every hyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\Omega$. Minimal linear codes have important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some algebraic hypersurfaces $\mathcal{V}_{\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e$ odd. These varieties give rise to new infinite family of linear codes which are minimal except for $r=3$ and $e\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. In the case $r \in \{3,4\}$, we also provide the complete list of the weights of the codes which turn out to be codes with at most $5$ non-zero weights. As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just $3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also important in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of the paper we propose an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect to subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap in order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not satisfied. Finally, we then apply these notions to Hermitian codes and to the codes related to $\mathcal{V}_\varepsilon^r$ discussed before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph $G$ denotes the minimum number of crossings in any planar drawing of $G$. In this short note, we confirm a long-standing conjecture posed by Pach, Spencer, and T\'oth over 25 years ago, establishing an optimal lower bound on the crossing number of graphs that satisfy some monotone properties. Furthermore, we address a related open problem introduced by Pach and T\'oth in 2000, which explores the interplay between the crossing number of a graph, its degree sequence, and its bisection width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a digraph, a kernel is a subset of vertices that is both independent and absorbing. Kernels have important applications in combinatorics and outside. Kernels do not always exist and finding sufficient conditions ensuring their existence is a key theoretical challenge. In this work, we revisit and generalize a few classical results of this sort, especially the Sands--Sauer--Woodrow theorem and the Galeana-S\'anchez--Neumann-Lara theorem.</description>

Abstract: We develop infinitary analogues of the $N\times N\times N$ Rubik's cube. We'll be pushed to consider the possibility of transfinitely many twists and the foremost question we shall study is whether or not all infinite scrambles are solvable, in principle, and in how many twists. As is typical of infinitary generalizations of everyday games and puzzles, several alternative definitions are reasonable, including in particular the edged and edgeless cubes, which bear surprising theoretical differences, not analogous to the finite case. We show that for the edged cube of cardinality $\aleph_\alpha$, all convergent (in a suitable sense) scrambles are in fact solvable in principle in fewer than $\omega_{\alpha+1}$ many moves. For the countable edgeless variation, we prove by entirely different methods that all convergent scrambles are solvable in a mere $\omega^2$ many moves and this solution does not require knowledge of how the scrambled configuration was obtained. Finally, we explore the space of all legal configurations of the countable edgeless cube connected to the solved configuration by accessibility. We invite several open questions, including the solvability in principle of edgeless cubes of uncountable cardinality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the direct sum of ideals satisfying the strong $\ell$-exchange property is of fiber type. Furthermore, we provide Gr\"obner bases of the presentation ideals of multi-Rees algebras and the corresponding special fibers, when they are associated with an $n$-dimensional Ferrers diagram that is standardizable. In particular, we show that these blowup algebras are
  Koszul Cohen--Macaulay normal domains and classify their singularities.</description>

      <title>A note on Ordered Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent breakthrough of Behnezhad and Ghafari [FOCS 2024] and subsequent work of Assadi, Khanna, and Kiss [SODA 2025] gave algorithms for the fully dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum matching problem whose runtimes are determined by a purely combinatorial quantity: the maximum density of Ordered Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi (ORS) graphs. We say a graph $G$ is an $(r,t)$-ORS graph if its edges can be partitioned into $t$ matchings $M_1,M_2, \ldots, M_t$ each of size $r$, such that for every $i$, $M_i$ is an induced matching in the subgraph $M_{i} \cup M_{i+1} \cup \cdots \cup M_t$. This is a relaxation of the extensively-studied notion of a Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi (RS) graph, the difference being that in an RS graph each $M_i$ must be an induced matching in $G$.
  In this note, we show that these two notions are roughly equivalent. Specifically, let $\mathrm{ORS}(n)$ be the largest $t$ such that there exists an $n$-vertex ORS-$(\Omega(n), t)$ graph, and define $\mathrm{RS}(n)$ analogously. We show that if $\mathrm{ORS}(n) \ge \Omega(n^c)$, then for any fixed $\delta &gt; 0$, $\mathrm{RS}(n) \ge \Omega(n^{c(1-\delta)})$. This resolves a question of Behnezhad and Ghafari.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Enriched Plane Curve Counting via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quadratically enriched count of rational curves in a smooth toric del Pezzo surface passing through $k$-rational points and pairs of conjugate points in quadratic field extensions $k\subset k(\sqrt{d_i})$ can be determined by counting certain tropical stable maps through vertically stretched point conditions with a suitable multiplicity. Building on the floor diagram technique in tropical geometry, we provide an algorithm to compute these numbers.
  Our tropical algorithm computes not only these new quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, but simultaneously also the complex Gromov-Witten invariant, the real Welschinger invariant counting curves satisfying real point conditions only, the real Welschinger invariant of curves satisfying pairs of complex conjugate and real point conditions, and the quadratically enriched count of curves satisfying $k$-rational point conditions.</description>

      <title>Honeycomb Tessellations and Graded Permutohedral Blades</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.03246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates enumerative aspects of permutohedral blades, which provide a generalization of the notion of the tropical hyperplane arrangement. Blade provide the combinatorial underpinning of generalized biadjoint scalar scattering amplitudes in work of Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM). We construct a graded basis for a vector space of indicator functions of blades, with the grading determined by the dimension of the support of the function. We prove a Minkowski sum decomposition law into lines and tripods and we explore connections to the cohomology ring of certain moduli spaces and a non-planar analog of the square move for plabic graphs.
  We give a closed formula for the graded dimension of the basis. It is shown in an Appendix by Donghyun Kim that the coefficients appearing in the numerator of the generating function for the graded dimension are symmetric, and that they sum to $\frac{(2j)!}{j!}$. Unimodality is still open.</description>

      <title>Splits with forbidden subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.14466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we fix a graph $H$ and ask into how many vertices can each vertex of a clique of size $n$ can be "split" such that the resulting graph is $H$-free. Formally: A graph is an $(n,k)$-graph if its vertex sets is a pairwise disjoint union of $n$ parts of size at most $k$ each such that there is an edge between any two distinct parts. Let
  $$ f(n,H) = \min \{k \in \mathbb N : \mbox{there is an $(n,k)$-graph $G$ such that $H\not\subseteq G$}\} . $$
  Barbanera and Ueckerdt observed that $f(n, H)=2$ for any graph $H$ that is not bipartite. If a graph $H$ is bipartite and has a well-defined Tur\'an exponent, i.e., ${\rm ex}(n, H) = \Theta(n^r)$ for some $r$, we show that $\Omega (n^{2/r -1}) = f(n, H) = O (n^{2/r-1} \log ^{1/r} n)$. We extend this result to all bipartite graphs for which an upper and a lower Tur\'an exponents do not differ by much. In addition, we prove that $f(n, K_{2,t}) =\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for any fixed $t$.</description>

      <title>Almost all 9-regular graphs have a modulo-5 orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1972 Tutte famously conjectured that every 4-edge-connected graph has a nowhere zero 3-flow; this is known to be equivalent to every 5-regular, 4-edge-connected graph having an edge orientation in which every in-degree is either 1 or 4. Jaeger conjectured a generalization of Tutte's conjecture, namely, that every $4p+1$-regular, $4p$-edge-connected graph has an edge orientation in which every in-degree is either $p$ or $3p+1$. Inspired by the work of Pralat and Wormald investigating $p=1$, for $p=2$ we show this holds asymptotically almost surely for random 9-regular graphs. It follows that the conjecture holds for almost all 9-regular, 8-edge-connected graphs. These results make use of the technical small subgraph conditioning method.</description>

      <title>Equality of skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of classifying when two skew Schur functions are equal is a substantial open problem, which remains unsolved for over a century. In 2022, Aliniaeifard, Li and van Willigenburg introduced skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables, $s_{(\delta,D)}$, where $D$ is a connected skew diagram with $n$ boxes and $\delta$ is a permutation in the symmetric group $S_n$.
  In this paper, we combine these two and classify when two skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables are equal: $s_{(\delta,D)} = s_{(\tau,T)}$ such that $D\ne T$ if and only if $D$ is a nonsymmetric ribbon, $T$ is the antipodal rotation of $D$ and $\overline{\tau^{-1}\delta}$ is an explicit bijection between two set partitions determined by $D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defective $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$ is a parking function with $m$ cars attempting to park on a street with $n$ parking spots in which exactly $d$ cars fail to park. We establish a way to compute the defect of a defective $(m,n)$-parking function and show that the defect of a parking function is invariant under the action of $\mathfrak{S}_m$, the symmetric group on $[m]=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$. We introduce the defective parking space ${{\sf DPark}}_{m,n}$ spanned by defective parking functions and describe its Frobenius characteristic as an $\mathfrak{S}_m$ representation graded by defect via coefficients $\mathrm{Krew}_{d,n}(\lambda)$ called defective Kreweras numbers. We provide a conjectured formula for $\mathrm{Krew}_{d,n}(\lambda)$ for sufficiently large $n$. We also show that the set of nondecreasing defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ are in bijection with the set of standard Young tableaux of shape $(n + d, m - d)$. This implies that the number of $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbits of defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ is given by $\frac{n-m+2d+1}{n+d+1}\binom{m+n}{n+d}$. We also give a multinomial formula for the size of an $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbit of a nondecreasing $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$. We conclude by using these results to give a new formula for the number of defective parking functions.</description>

Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>

Abstract: We define various notions of energy of a set of vertices in a graph, which generalize two of the most widely studied graphical indices: the Wiener index and the Harary index. We provide a new proof of a result due to Douthett and Krantz, which says that for cycles, the sets of vertices which have minimal energy among all sets of the same size are precisely the maximally even sets, as defined in Clough and Douthett's work on music theory. Generalizing a theorem of Clough and Douthett, we prove that a finite, simple, connected graph is distance degree regular if and only if whenever a set of vertices has minimal energy, its complement also has minimal energy. We also provide several characterizations of sets of vertices in finite paths and cycles for which the sum of all pairwise distances between vertices in the set is maximal among all sets of the same size.</description>

This yields a resolution of Vsevolod Lev's periodicity conjecture, which asserts that if a sum-free subset ${A\subseteq {\mathbb F}_3^n}$ is maximal with respect to inclusion and aperiodic (in the sense that there is no non-zero vector $v$ satisfying $A+v=A$), then $|A|\le \frac12(3^{n-1}+1)$ -- a bound known to be optimal if $n\ne 2$, while for $n=2$ there are no such sets.</description>

Abstract: The vertex coloring problem to find chromatic numbers is known to be unsolvable in polynomial time. Although various algorithms have been proposed to efficiently compute chromatic numbers, they tend to take an enormous amount of time for large graphs. In this paper, we propose a recurrence relation to rapidly obtain the expected value of the chromatic number of random graphs. Then we compare the results obtained using this recurrence relation with other methods using an exact investigation of all graphs, the Monte Carlo method, the iterated random color matching method, and the method presented in Bollob\'{a}s' previous studies.</description>

      <title>Spectral Radius of Graphs with Size Constraints: Resolving a Conjecture of Guiduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to satisfy the Hereditarily Bounded Property $P_{t,r}$ if, for every subgraph $H$ of $G$ with at least $t$ vertices, the size of $H$ satisfies $|E(H)| \leq t \cdot |V(H)| + r$. In 1996, Guiduli posed the following problem: If an $n$-vertex graph $G$ possesses the property $P_{t,r}$, where $t$ is a positive real number and $r$ is a real number such that $r \geq -\binom{\lfloor t+1 \rfloor}{2}$, does it follow that the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ is bounded above by $c(s,t) + \sqrt{\lfloor t \rfloor n}$, where $s = \binom{t+1}{2} + r$?
  In this paper, we affirmatively resolve Guiduli's problem. Furthermore, we provide a precise characterization of the extremal graphs that achieve this bound. Specifically, these extremal graphs are constructed as the join of two graphs: one being a complete graph $K_{\lfloor t \rfloor}$, and the other either a disjoint union of $K_3$ and isolated vertices, or a forest consisting solely of star structures.
  The forest of order $n-\lfloor t \rfloor$ in extremal graphs is meticulously characterized. The key to our proof is the classification of the stars into four categories--maximal, large, small, and minimal--according to their sizes. This classification provides deeper insights into how edge distribution influence the spectral properties of graphs under the constraint of property $P_{t,r}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any lower triangular and totally nonnegative matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to one gives rise to a family of polynomials with only real zeros. This has consequences to problems in several areas of mathematics. It is used to develop a general theory for chain enumeration in posets and zeros chain polynomials. The results obtained extend and unify results of the first author, Brenti, Welker and Athanasiadis. In the process we define a notion of $h$-vectors for a large class of posets which generalize the notions of $h$-vectors associated to simplicial and cubical complexes. A consequence of our methods is a characterization of the convex hull of all characteristic polynomials of hyperplane arrangements of fixed dimension and over a fixed finite field. This may be seen as a refinement of the critical problem of Crapo and Rota.
  We also use the methods developed to answer an open problem posed by Forg\'acs and Tran on the real-rootedness of polynomials arising from certain bivariate rational functions.</description>

Abstract: The study of spectral graph determination is a fascinating area of research in spectral graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. This field focuses on examining the spectral characterization of various classes of graphs, developing methods to construct or distinguish cospectral nonisomorphic graphs, and analyzing the conditions under which a graph's spectrum uniquely determines its structure. This paper presents an overview of both classical and recent advancements in these topics, along with newly obtained proofs of some existing results, which offer additional insights.</description>

      <title>On Counting H-Intersecting Families and Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work leverages Shearer's inequalities to derive a new upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which every pair of graphs shares a fixed common subgraph. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of the shared subgraph. Additionally, Shearer's inequalities, in conjunction with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <title>On Monochromatic Solutions of Linear Equations Using At Least Three Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the number of monochromatic solution to linear equation in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ when we color the set by at least three colors. We consider the $r$-commonness for $r\geq 3$ of linear equation with odd number of terms, and we also prove that any $2$-uncommon equation is $r$-uncommon for any $r\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The Polytope of Probability Functions on a Finite Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kim, Kim, and Neggers (2019) defined probability functions on a poset, by listing some very natural conditions that a function \(\pi: P \times P \to [0,1]\) should satisfy in order to capture the intuition of "the likelihood that \(a\) precedes \(b\) in \(P\)". In particular, this generalizes the common notion of poset probability for finite posets, where \(\pi(a,b)\) is the proportion of linear extensions of \(P\) in which \(a\) precedes \(b\).
  They constructed a family of such functions for posets embedded in the ordered plane; that is two say, for posets of order dimension at most two.
  We study probability functions of a finite poset \(P\) by constructing an ancillary poset \(\tilde{P}\), that we call *probability functions posets*. The relations of this new poset encodes the restrictions imposed on probability functions of the original poset by the conditions of the definition. Then, we define the probability functions polytope, which parameterizes the probability functions on \(P\), and show that it can be realized as the order polytope of \(\tilde{P}\) intersected by a certain affine subspace.
  We give a partial description of the vertices of probability functions polytope and show that, in contrast to the order polytope, it is not always a lattice polytope.</description>

Abstract: We give a combinatorial characterization of the identities holding in the semiring of all upper triangular Boolean $n\times n$-matrices and apply the characterization to computational complexity of identity checking, finite axiomatizability of equational theories, and algebraic descriptions of certain classes of recognizable languages.</description>
