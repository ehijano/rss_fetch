      <title>A meshless method to compute the proper orthogonal decomposition and its variants from scattered data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex phenomena can be better understood when broken down into a limited number of simpler "components". Linear statistical methods such as the principal component analysis and its variants are widely used across various fields of applied science to identify and rank these components based on the variance they represent in the data. These methods can be seen as factorizations of the matrix collecting all the data, which are assumed to be a collection of time series sampled from fixed points in space. However, when data sampling locations vary over time, as with mobile monitoring stations in meteorology and oceanography or with particle tracking velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics, advanced interpolation techniques are required to project the data onto a fixed grid before carrying out the factorization. This interpolation is often expensive and inaccurate. This work proposes a method to decompose scattered data without interpolating. The approach is based on physics-constrained radial basis function regression to compute inner products in space and time. The method provides an analytical and mesh-independent decomposition in space and time, demonstrating higher accuracy than the traditional approach. Our results show that it is possible to distill the most relevant "components" even for measurements whose natural output is a distribution of data scattered in space and time, maintaining high accuracy and mesh independence.</description>

      <title>Validation of Theoretical Estimation Methods and Maximum Value Distribution Calculation for Parametric Roll Amplitude in Long-Crested Irregular Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric rolling is a parametric excitation phenomenon caused by GM variation in waves. There are a lot of studies of the estimation the conditions, the occurrence, and the amplitude of parametric rolling. On the other hand, there are relatively few cases in which theoretical methods for estimating parametric roll amplitudes in irregular waves have been validated in tank tests. The primary objective of this study is to validate theoretical estimation methods for the parametric roll amplitude in irregular waves and improve their accuracy. First, the probability density functions (PDF) of the parametric roll amplitude obtained from the model ship motion experiment in irregular waves are compared with that obtained from theoretical estimation methods. Second, the method to improve the accuracy of estimation of the roll restoring variation in irregular waves is suggested. Third, the method to estimate the distribution of the maximum amplitude of parametric rolling in irregular waves. As a result, the PDFs of the roll amplitude obtained from the experiments differ from the results of theoretical estimation. After that, by correcting GM variation, the results of theoretical estimation are closer to the experimental results. Moreover, by the theoretical estimation method using the moment equation, the qualitative estimation for the PDF of the maximum roll amplitude is succeeded.</description>

      <title>Developing a Novel Image Marker to Predict the Clinical Outcome of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) for Ovarian Cancer Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is one kind of treatment for advanced stage ovarian cancer patients. However, due to the nature of tumor heterogeneity, the clinical outcomes to NACT vary significantly among different subgroups. Partial responses to NACT may lead to suboptimal debulking surgery, which will result in adverse prognosis. To address this clinical challenge, the purpose of this study is to develop a novel image marker to achieve high accuracy prognosis prediction of NACT at an early stage. Methods For this purpose, we first computed a total of 1373 radiomics features to quantify the tumor characteristics, which can be grouped into three categories: geometric, intensity, and texture features. Second, all these features were optimized by principal component analysis algorithm to generate a compact and informative feature cluster. This cluster was used as input for developing and optimizing support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers, which indicated the likelihood of receiving suboptimal cytoreduction after the NACT treatment. Two different kernels for SVM algorithm were explored and compared. A total of 42 ovarian cancer cases were retrospectively collected to validate the scheme. A nested leave-one-out cross-validation framework was adopted for model performance assessment. Results The results demonstrated that the model with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel SVM yielded an AUC (area under the ROC [receiver characteristic operation] curve) of 0.806. Meanwhile, this model achieved overall accuracy (ACC) of 83.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 81.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 83.9%. Conclusion This study provides meaningful information for the development of radiomics based image markers in NACT treatment outcome prediction.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information theoretic-based randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>
