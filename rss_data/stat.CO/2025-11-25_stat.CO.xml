      <title>Metric/Nonmetric Elastic MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present R and C implementations for metric (ratio) and non-metric (ordinal) versions of Elastic MDS, the multidimensional scaling technique proposed by McGee (1966). The R and C versions are compared for speed, with the C version anywhere from 15 to 100 times as fast as the R version.</description>

      <title>On a Reinforcement Learning Methodology for Epidemic Control, with application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a real time, data driven decision support framework for epidemic control. We combine a compartmental epidemic model with sequential Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning (RL) controllers that adaptively choose intervention levels to balance disease burden, such as intensive care unit (ICU) load, against socio economic costs. We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy. Over a 300 day period and for a range of cost parameters, both controllers substantially reduce ICU burden relative to the observed interventions, illustrating how Bayesian sequential learning combined with RL can support the design of epidemic control policies.</description>

      <title>Geometric Rough Paths above Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive theory of geometric rough paths for mixed fractional Brownian motion (MFBM) and its generalized multi-component extensions. We prove that for a generalized MFBM of the form $M_t^H(a) = \sum_{k=1}^N a_k B_t^{H_k}$ with $\min\{H_k\} &gt; \frac{1}{4}$, there exists a canonical geometric rough path obtained as the limit of smooth rough paths associated with dyadic approximations. This extends the classical result of Coutin and Qian \cite{coutin2002} for single fractional Brownian motion to the mixed case.
  We provide explicit bounds on the $p$-variation norms and establish a Skorohod integral representation connecting our pathwise construction to the Malliavin calculus framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications to rough differential equations driven by MFBM, enabling the use of Lyons' universal limit theorem for this class of processes. Finally, we study the signature of MFBM paths, providing a complete algebraic characterization of their geometric properties.
  Our approach unifies the treatment of multiple fractional components and reveals the fundamental interactions between different regularity scales, completing the rough path foundation for mixed fractional processes with applications in stochastic analysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation approaches for high-dimensional optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool in mathematics and data science but faces severe computational and statistical challenges in high dimensions. We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</description>
