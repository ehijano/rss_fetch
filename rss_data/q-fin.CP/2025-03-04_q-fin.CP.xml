      <title>Risk-Adjusted Performance of Random Forest Models in High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the theoretical challenges posed by the Efficient Market Hypothesis to technical analysis, the effectiveness of technical indicators in high-frequency trading remains inadequately explored, particularly at the minute-level frequency, where effects of the microstructure of the market dominate. This study evaluates the integration of traditional technical indicators with random forest regression models using minute-level SPY data, analyzing 13 distinct model configurations. Our empirical results reveal a stark contrast between in-sample and out-of-sample performance, with $R^2$ values deteriorating from 0.749--0.812 during training to negative values in testing. A feature importance analysis demonstrates that primary price-based features dominate the predictions made by the model, accounting for over 60% of the importance, while established technical indicators, such as RSI and Bollinger Bands, account for only 14%--15%. Although the indicator-enhanced models achieved superior risk-adjusted metrics, with Rachev ratios between 0.919 and 0.961, they consistently underperformed a simple buy-and-hold strategy, generating returns ranging from -2.4% to -3.9%. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about the usefulness of technical indicators in algorithmic trading, suggesting that in high-frequency contexts, they may be more relevant to risk management rather than to predicting returns. For practitioners and researchers, our findings indicate that successful high-frequency trading strategies should focus on adaptive feature selection and regime-specific modeling rather than relying on traditional technical indicators, as well as indicating the critical importance of robust out-of-sample testing in the development of a model.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a portion of short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from liquidity fluctuations induced by wash trading. We develop a model decomposing liquidity into two components: liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (probability of fluctuation). High values for both liquidity measures indicate wash trading, while high liquidity jump with low liquidity diffusion suggests legitimate high-demand trading. Together, these liquidity measures enable detection of wash trades and help market participants understand liquidity dynamics, and make informed decisions in crypto trading.</description>
