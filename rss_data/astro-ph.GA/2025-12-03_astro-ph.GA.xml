      <title>COSMOS-3D: Two obscured X-ray AGNs with hot dust and He I$\lambda$10830 absorption at z~3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He I$\lambda$10830+ Pa$\gamma$ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$\lambda$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission line with luminosity $\log L_{\rm Ly\alpha}=42.49\pm0.01~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$\lambda$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.</description>

      <title>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of satellite galaxies around 1,024 Milky Way-mass hosts from the DREAMS Project, simulated within a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling.</description>

      <title>Discovery of two little red dots transitioning into quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of compact objects that show a unique V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) in the UV and optical wavelength range. These so-called "little red dots" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.</description>

      <title>Image simulations of highly magnified clumpy galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ClumPyLen, a Python-based simulator designed to produce realistic mock observations of strongly lensed, high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. The tool models galaxy components such as disks, bulges, and spiral arms using S\'ersic profiles, and it populates them with stellar clumps whose properties are sampled from physically motivated distributions. ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects. Thanks to its modular design, the code is highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific goals, including lensing studies, galaxy evolution, and the generation of synthetic datasets for machine learning or forward modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Determining the Milky Way gravitational potential without selection functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection effects, such as interstellar extinction and varying survey depth, complicate efforts to determine the gravitational potential - and thus the distribution of baryonic and dark matter - throughout the Milky Way galaxy using stellar kinematics. We present a new variant of the "Deep Potential" method of determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions and velocities that does not require any modeling of spatial selection functions. Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function. We simultaneously learn the gravitational potential $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$ and the underlying spatial density of the entire tracer population $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$ - including unobserved stars - using the collisionless Boltzmann equation under the stationarity assumption. The advantage of this method is that unlike the spatial selection function, all of the quantities we model, $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$, and $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$, typically vary smoothly in both position and velocity. We demonstrate that this "conditional" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function. Because we do not need to model the spatial selection function, our new method can effectively scale to large, complex datasets while using relatively few parameters, and is thus well suited to Gaia data.</description>

      <title>VENUS: When Red meets Blue -- A multiply imaged Little Red Dot with an apparent blue companion behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=6.027$, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby ($\sim 380$ pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is $\mu_{\mathrm{A}}=16.2\pm1.2$ and $\mu_\mathrm{B}=9.0\pm0.6$, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is $\Delta t_{\mathrm{grav}}=5.20\pm0.14$ yr ($\sim0.7$ yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of $M_{\mathrm{UV,LRD}}=-16.8\pm 0.3$ for the LRD, and $M_{\mathrm{UV,BC}}=-18.2\pm 0.2$ for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $_{II}$]$\lambda158 \ \mu$m emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>SEAMLESS Survey: Four Faint Dwarf Galaxies Tracing Low-Mass Galaxy Evolution Across Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on four Local Volume dwarf galaxies identified through our ongoing SEmi-Automated Machine LEarning Search for Semi-resolved galaxies (SEAMLESS): Hydrus A, LEDA 486718, Cetus B, and Sculptor 26, with the discovery of Hydrus A reported here for the first time. These four galaxies span a wide range of environments and evolutionary states. Hydrus A (MV = -9.39+/-0.20, D = 3.38-0.30+0.32 Mpc) and LEDA 486718 (MV = -11.62+/-0.08, D = 4.80+/-0.17 Mpc) are among the most isolated dwarfs known within 5 Mpc, while Cetus B (MV = -8.26+/-0.17, D = 3.32-0.23+0.25 Mpc) and Sculptor 26 (MV = -11.25+/-0.10, D =3.21+/-0.13 Mpc) lie &lt; 2 Rvir of NGC 253. Hydrus A shows properties consistent with quenching driven by cosmic reionization, cosmic-web interactions, or internal feedback. LEDA 486718 is an isolated star forming dwarf. Cetus B appears quenched and morphologically disturbed, making it a low-mass satellite or backsplash candidate, while Sculptor 26 is red and seemingly gas-poor but displays signs of recent activity, consistent with a transitional evolutionary state. Together, these systems demonstrate the power of SEAMLESS for building a census of faint galaxies beyond the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of young stellar objects in NGC 2024 based on infrared proper motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recently formed young stellar objects (YSOs) in active star forming regions are excellent tracers of their parent cloud motion. Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of &lt;5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a &gt;13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (&lt;1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0). Some Class II and III objects appear to be already decoupling.</description>

      <title>A value-added catalogue of neural network-based europium abundances for GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid neutron-capture ($r$-process) element europium (Eu) is a valuable tracer of neutron star mergers and other rare nucleosynthetic events. The stellar spectroscopic survey GALAH's unique wavelength range and setup include the Eu absorption feature at $\sim6645$ \r{A} for almost a million stars in the most recent Data Release 4 (DR4). However, DR4 also saw a decreased precision in reported Eu measurements compared to previous data releases. In this work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform label transfer, wherein we use the GALAH DR4 spectra and stellar parameters to infer DR3 [Eu/H] abundances. This CNN is then applied to DR4 spectra without corresponding DR3 Eu abundances to develop a new, publicly available catalogue of [Eu/H] values for high signal-to-noise targets. We include [Eu/H] predictions for $118\,946$ stars, out of which $54\,068$ giants constitute our "golden sample" of high-confidence predictions, which pass stricter quality cuts and have a reported precision $\lesssim0.1$. To overcome the scarcity of training data in the low metallicity regime, we provide an additional catalogue of [Eu/H] abundances for metal poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-1$) stars derived from synthesis of the Eu feature. Our "golden sample" can be combined with [Eu/H] values from GALAH DR3 to create a catalogue of over $100\,000$ vetted, high-quality abundances on a homogeneous scale. Moreover, we are able to reproduce known science results, including the elevated Eu abundances of accreted stars and previously observed Galactic chemical evolution trends. This catalogue represents one of the largest available samples of [Eu/H] abundances for high signal-to-noise targets.</description>

      <title>Ripples in the baryon to dark matter ratio in $\Lambda$CDM: implications for galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of $1.5\%$ on the Lagrangian scale of a $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$ halo ($0.85\, \rm{Mpc}$). Although such perturbations arise naturally within $\Lambda$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\%$ and $ 12\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching $ 0.1\%$ and $ 1\%$ by $z=0$. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.</description>

      <title>$S^5$: Tidal Disruption in Crater 2 and Formation of Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a spectroscopic campaign around the diffuse dwarf galaxy Crater 2 (Cra2) and its tidal tails as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$). Cra2 is a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite with extremely cold kinematics, but a huge size similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which may be difficult to explain within collisionless cold dark matter. We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\approx$7$\sigma$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track. We separately estimate the stream velocity dispersion to be $5.74^{+0.98}_{-0.83}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. We develop a suite of $N$-body simulations with both cuspy and cored density profiles on a realistic Cra2 orbit to compare with $S^5$ observations. We find that the velocity dispersion ratio between Cra2 stream and galaxy ($2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.35}$) is difficult to reconcile with a cuspy halo with fiducial concentration and an initial mass predicted by standard stellar mass$-$halo mass relationships. Instead, either a cored halo with relatively small core radius or a low-concentration cuspy model can reproduce this ratio. Despite tidal mass loss, Cra2 is metal-poor ($\langle \rm[Fe/H]\rangle=-2.16\pm0.04$) compared to the stellar mass$-$metallicity relation for its luminosity. Other diffuse dwarf galaxies similar to Cra2 in the Local Group (Antlia 2 and Andromeda 19) also challenge galaxy formation models. Finally, we discuss possible formation scenarios for Cra2, including ram-pressure stripping of a gas-rich progenitor combined with tides.</description>

      <title>How much gas and dust is in the $z=5.7$ Lyman Break Galaxy HZ10? An ALMA Band 10 to 4 and JWST/NIRSpec study of its interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete overview of the stellar, gas and dust contents of galaxies is key to understanding their assembly at early times. However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at $z=5.65$, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 ($\lambda_\mathrm{rest}=50\mu$m) and Band 4 ($300\mu$m) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data ($70-200\mu$m) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the $3.4-4.0\sigma$ level, and measure a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{dust} = 37_{-5}^{+6}$K and dust mass $\log(M_\mathrm{dust}/M_\odot) = 8.0 \pm 0.1$. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H$_2$ and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to $\alpha_\mathrm{[CII]}^\mathrm{ISM} = 39^{+50}_{-25}M_\odot L_\odot^{-1}$. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Mass Dependence of UV-to-near-IR Color Gradients up to z=2.5 from HST+JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the redshift evolution of radial color gradients (in rest-frame ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$) for galaxies in the range $0.5&lt;$ z $&lt;2.5$ and investigate their origin and dependence on stellar mass. We select $\sim 10,200$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star&gt;10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$ from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D S\'ersic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients within 2$R_\text{e, F444W}$. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{10.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at $z&gt;1.5$ ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ colors are $\approx 0.5$ mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation ($A_V$), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all $z$, although the correlation weakens at higher $z$. The ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from $\approx -0.1$ to $\approx- 0.2$ mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low $A_V$, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.</description>

      <title>Silicate emission in a type-2 quasar: JWST/MIRI constraints on torus geometry and radiative feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\rm C_T=0.45\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\rm C_T=0.66\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\rm i=50^\circ\pm^{8^\circ}_{9^\circ}$ and $\rm i=13^\circ\pm^{7^\circ}_{6^\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V LVM: Resolving Physical Conditions in the Trifid Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Str\"omgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.</description>

      <title>Direct observational evidence that higher-luminosity type 1 active galactic nuclei are most commonly triggered by galaxy mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the connection between galaxy mergers and the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using a sample of 614 type 1 AGNs at $z&lt;0.07$, along with a control sample of inactive galaxies matched to the AGNs for comparison. We used tidal features, detected in deep images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, as direct evidence of recent mergers. We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\pm0.03$ to $0.75\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]$ $\lambda$5007 emission line ($L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\lesssim L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}) \lesssim10^{42.5}$. In addition, $f_T$ increases from $0.13\pm0.03$ to $0.43\pm0.09$ as black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) increases in the range $10^{6.0}\lesssim M_\mathrm{BH}/M_{\odot}\lesssim10^{8.5}$. The fraction $f_T$ also increases with the Eddington ratio, although the trend is less significant compared to that with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and $M_\mathrm{BH}$. The excess of $f_T$, defined as the ratio of $f_T$ for AGNs to that of their matched inactive counterparts, exhibits similar trends, primarily increasing with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and weakly with $M_\mathrm{BH}$. Our results indicate that, in the local Universe, galaxy mergers are the predominant triggering mechanism for high-luminosity AGNs, whereas they play a lesser role in triggering lower-luminosity AGNs. Additionally, strong events, such as galaxy mergers, may be more necessary to activate massive black holes in more massive galaxies due to their lower gas fractions.</description>

      <title>The Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Quasar Survey: Quasar Properties from Data Release 10 to 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the quasar catalog from Data Releases 10 to 12 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Quasar Survey, comprising quasars observed between September 2021 and June 2024. We robustly identified $11,346$ quasars, of which $5,386$ are newly discovered objects not present in the Million Quasars catalog. This release brings the total number of quasars identified by the 12-year LAMOST survey to $67,521$, of which $29,513$ are newly discovered. While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability.</description>

      <title>On Constraining the Proposed Hierarchical Triple Scenario for an Eccentric Milli-Second Pulsar Binary PSR J1618-3921</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very recent and meticulous timing effort suggests that an eccentric millisecond pulsar (eMSP) binary, namely PSR J1618-3921, is likely to be a part of a hierarchical triple (HT) system with a $0.6M_{\odot}$ companion in a $\sim 300$yr orbit. We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\dot{\omega}$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing ram pressure from gravitational interactions: Applying the Size-Shape Difference method to real galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dense environments, mechanisms like ram pressure stripping (RPS) and gravitational interactions can induce similar morphological features in galaxies, distinguishable only through detailed study of their stellar properties. While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t &lt; 20 Myr and 20 Myr &lt;= t &lt; 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>The Composite Spectrum of QSO Absorption Line Systems in DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present details regarding the construction of a composite spectrum of quasar (QSO) absorption line systems. In this composite spectrum we identify more than 70 absorption lines, and observe oxygen and hydrogen emission features at a higher signal-to-noise ratio than in any previous study. As the light from a distant quasar travels towards an observer, it may interact with the circumgalactic medium environment of an intervening galaxy, forming absorption lines. In order to maximize the signal of these absorption lines, we have selected a sample of 238,838 quasar spectra from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), each identified to have absorption lines resulting from such an interaction. By stacking these spectra in the restframe of the absorption, and calculating a median composite spectrum, we are able to isolate and enhance these absorption lines. We provide a full atlas of all detected absorption and emission lines as well as their fit centroids and equivalent width values. This atlas should aid in future studies investigating the compositions and physical conditions of these absorbers.</description>

      <title>MIRI spectrophotometry of GN-z11: Detection and nature of an optical red continuum component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$\mu$m. We report significant detections (14$\sigma$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$\sigma$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_\nu$, up to 0.5$\mu$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$\mu$m shows a 36$\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$\mu$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$\mu$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$\mu$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$\mu$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Effect of the avoided crossing on the rovibrational energy levels, resonances, and predissociation lifetimes within the ground and first excited electronic states of lithium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02085</link>

Abstract: We investigate the LiF spectrum up to $7800$ cm$^{-1}$ above the first dissociation limit. The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, $r=1$-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born-Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two functions imitating the diabatic terms whereas the coupling between them was set constant equal to the half of the minimum separation between the adiabatic terms, and then we define the final diabatic terms and the final diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm$^{-1}$ for $^7$LiF, 0.0006 cm$^{-1}$ for $^6$LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines. The line lists for the bound-bound $X$-$X$ rovibrational transitions are calculated for quantum numbers $v\le50,\Delta v\le15,J\le170$ ($J\le200$ for the 0-0 and 1-0 bands).</description>

      <title>Photon (Non)Conservation in the Reduced Speed of Light Approximation and How to (Almost) Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Reduced Speed of Light" (RSL) approximation is commonly used to speed up radiative transfer calculations in cosmological simulations. However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>JCMT Constraints on the Early-Time HCN and CO Emission and HCN Temporal Evolution of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `\=U`\=u heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Slow-Light Effect in the Jet-Launching Region of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of "slow-light" radiative transfer - i.e., general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in which the simulated fluid evolves while light rays are propagating through it - in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of the M87 jet. Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial "wobbling", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight II: Characterizing the luminous companion to Kappa Velorum with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\ M_\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\pm0.01^{\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\varpi = 6.05\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\pm1.0\ M_\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Sources of Abundance Dispersion in Low-metallicity Stars II: Neutron Capture Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the abundances of 23 elements, including 11 heavy elements (Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu) for up to 86 metal-poor (-2 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1) subgiants. We use KORG, a state of the art spectral synthesis package, to derive 1D-LTE abundances from high-SNR and high-resolution spectra taken by the Large Binocular Telescope with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument. These precise spectra and abundance measurements minimize the impact of photon-noise (&lt;0.06 dex), allowing us to robustly measure the intrinsic abundance scatter in [X/Fe]. After removing two stars with exceptional s-process enhancement, we find that the intrinsic scatter among the s- and r-process elements tends to be larger than for the lighter elements, with heavy element scatter ranging from 0.11 (Zn) to 0.27 (Eu) dex. Intrinsic abundance scatter could have multiple origins, including star-to-star variations in the ratios of nucleosynthetic sources as well as stochastic sampling of the progenitor supernovae properties, such as mass, rotation, and magnetic field strength. We explore the expected abundance scatter signature caused by stochastic sampling, finding that a fraction of both rapidly rotating CCSN and magnetorotationally driven SN are needed to reach the observed abundances and intrinsic scatter. This analysis is limited by the restrictive parameter spaces spanned by existing yield sets. A diverse, finely sampled grid of supernovae yields is needed to robustly model stochastic abundance scatter.</description>

      <title>AT2022zod: An Unusual Tidal Disruption Event in an Elliptical Galaxy at Redshift 0.11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have long been hypothesized as valuable indicators of black holes, offering insight into their demographics and behaviour out to high redshift. TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\,M_\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\,M_\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins" in the Hubble flow, and the determination of H0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $&gt;$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$.
  Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method.
  We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP),
  contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$
  from single SNe Ia.
  On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia.
  Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy.
  Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the
  Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of
  H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$.
  There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with
  the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.
  The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids,
  and of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP. We take a mean of the two
  values of H$_{0}$ and obtain H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.610 $\pm$ 1.289(stat) $\pm$ 1.085 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The role of the galaxy stellar mass function in determining the cosmological distribution of astrophysical transients with applications to fast radio bursts and merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.</description>

Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a framework of theories that adjust Newton's laws of gravity to explain effects such as galactic rotation anomalies, offering an alternative to dark matter. This essay examines the justification of MOND by assessing its inter-theoretical relationship to established theories across relevant scales, in particular its connection to Newtonian gravitation. We argue that MOND fails a key condition for a theory's justification--what we call 'reduction-wise justification'--since it does not adequately reduce to Newtonian gravity in a fully non-arbitrary way. More precisely, despite satisfying the standard formal criteria for successful limiting reduction, MOND does not properly reduce to Newtonian gravitation because of (i) the absence of a fundamental theoretical framework to justify the interpolating function introduced in MOND and (ii) the lack of a unified mathematical structure working across all scales, independent of Newtonian theory. Hence, the case study of MOND provides crucial results for the general debate on inter-theoretic reduction in science: MOND's failure as a case of reduction highlights important limitations in standard accounts of limiting reduction. We respond by proposing a more refined framework for limiting reduction that introduces two additional criteria to better distinguish successful from pathological reductions. More broadly, this case illustrates how analysing reduction-wise justification can serve as a powerful tool for evaluating the validity of novel theories that are not yet empirically established.</description>

      <title>Modeling dark matter halos with self-interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the possibility of modeling the dark matter content in galaxies as a core-halo model consisting of self-gravitating, self-interacting fermions. For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $\chi^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\rm{eV}&lt; m_{f} &lt; 42.11~\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 &lt; y &lt;348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas. Similar values are obtained if the halo is modeled following a Navarro-Frenk-White case, namely $41.54 ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_{f} &lt;49.87 ~\rm{eV}$ and $5606.06&lt; y &lt; 17484.84$. Once fixed the values of the mass of the fermion $m_f$ and the interaction strength $y$, we tested the core-halo model with data from the Milky Way and the SPARC database. We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo.</description>

      <title>A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: implications for feedback models in galaxy formation and cosmic shear measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $y$-type distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation probes the pressure of the gas trapped in galaxy groups and clusters. We reanalyze archival data of the FIRAS instrument with an improved astrophysical foreground cleaning technique, and measure a mean $y$-distortion of $\langle y\rangle = (1.2\pm 2.0) \times 10^{-6}$ ($\langle y\rangle\lesssim 5.2\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% C.L.), a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than the original FIRAS results. This measurement directly rules out many models of baryonic feedback as implemented in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, mostly using information in objects with mass $M\lesssim 10^{14} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We discuss its implications for the analysis of cosmic shear and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect data, and future spectral distortion experiments.</description>

      <title>The Case for Hot-Mode Accretion in Abell 2029</title>

Abstract: Radiative cooling and AGN heating are thought to form a feedback loop that regulates the evolution of low redshift cool-core galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations suggest that formation of multiphase gas in the cluster core imposes a floor on the ratio of cooling time ($t_{\rm cool}$) to free-fall time ($t_{\rm ff}$) at $\min ( t_{\rm cool} / t_{\rm ff} ) \approx 10$. Observations of galaxy clusters show evidence for such a floor, and usually the cluster cores with $\min ( t_{\rm cool} / t_{\rm ff} ) \lesssim 30$ contain abundant multiphase gas. However, there are important outliers. One of them is Abell 2029, a massive galaxy cluster ($M_{200} \gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$) with $\min( t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}) \sim 20$, but little apparent multiphase gas. In this paper, we present high resolution 3D hydrodynamic AMR simulations of a cluster similar to A2029 and study how it evolves over a period of 1-2 Gyr. Those simulations suggest that Abell 2029 self-regulates without producing multiphase gas because the mass of its central black hole ($\sim 5\times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$) is great enough for Bondi accretion of hot ambient gas to produce enough feedback energy to compensate for radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>REBELS-IFU: Dust Build-up in Massive Galaxies at Redshift 7</title>

Abstract: In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond $z\gtrsim6$. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve $6.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7$ galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average $\log(\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \pm 0.23$, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average $\log(\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \pm 0.42$ is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at $z\approx7$ likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.</description>

Abstract: Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\leq z\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}$, with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.</description>

      <title>Structure and Magnetic Field of the Bright-rimmed Cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension part.Since molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemically homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem. hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for dormant galaxies at z~5-7 from the JWST NIRSpec archive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of ``dormant'' galaxies at $z&gt;5$ that have recently halted their star formation and are characterized by weak emission lines and significant Balmer breaks. Until now, only four such galaxies have been reported at $z&gt;5$, three with low stellar masses, $M_*&lt;10^9M_\odot$ (so-called mini-quenched galaxies), and one massive quiescent galaxy with $M_*=10^{10.2}M_\odot$; no such galaxy had been reported at intermediate masses. Here, we present a systematic search for dormant galaxies at $5&lt;z&lt;7.4$ that halted star formation at least 10 Myr before the time of observation. To do this, we made use of all the publicly available NIRSpec prism data in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) and selected galaxies with low H$\alpha$ equivalent widths ($EW_{0}&lt;50$\AA) and strong Balmer breaks ($F_{\nu,4200}/F_{\nu,3500}&gt;1.4$). We find 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^{7.6}-10^{10.5}$, revealing an intermediate-mass population. By construction, these 14 sources are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star formation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according to models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts driving a ``breathing'' mode of star formation. Our results show that $\sim1\%$ of the galaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories, and they span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected using only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data.</description>

      <title>Testing Photometric Techniques for Measuring the Rest-Frame UV Spectral Slope Against JWST PRISM Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', $\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through four methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring $\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Improves Photometric Redshifts in All Regions of Color Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) are crucial for the cosmology, galaxy evolution, and transient science drivers of next-generation imaging facilities like the Euclid Mission, the Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Previous work has shown that image-based deep learning photo-$z$ methods produce smaller scatter than photometry-based classical machine learning (ML) methods on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample, a testbed photo-$z$ dataset. However, global assessments can obscure local trends. To explore this possibility, we used a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster SDSS galaxies based on their $ugriz$ colors. Deep learning methods achieve lower photo-$z$ scatter than classical ML methods for all SOM cells. The fractional reduction in scatter is roughly constant across most of color space with the exception of the most bulge-dominated and reddest cells where it is smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, classical ML photo-$z$'s suffer from a significant color-dependent attenuation bias, where photo-$z$'s for galaxies within a SOM cell are systematically biased towards the cell's mean spectroscopic redshift and away from extreme values, which is not readily apparent when all objects are considered. In contrast, deep learning photo-$z$'s suffer from very little color-dependent attenuation bias. The increased attenuation bias for classical ML photo-$z$ methods is the primary reason why they exhibit larger scatter than deep learning methods. This difference can be explained by the deep learning methods weighting redshift information from the individual pixels of a galaxy image more optimally than integrated photometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies -- four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range $1.9 \leq z \leq 2$, the outlier being at $z = 3.1$. Our sample covers a range of $8.0 &lt;$ \logM $&lt; 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 &lt;$ $\log{\rm{(SFR}}$/\Msunpyr) $&lt; 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 &lt;$ \logOH $&lt; 9.0$ in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the \textit{OHNO} parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r&lt;15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r&lt;1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.</description>

      <title>LIMFAST. IV. Learning High-Redshift Galaxy Formation from Multiline Intensity Mapping with Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.</description>

      <title>No Observational Evidence for Dark Matter Nor a Large Metallicity Spread in the Extreme Milky Way Satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \ L_{\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\sigma_v&lt; 2.3 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, with a $\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\sigma_* \approx 0.1 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \; \pm \, 0.1$ (stat.) $\pm \,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} &lt; 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the faintest and most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered.</description>

      <title>On the Dusty Proximate Damped Lyman-{\alpha} System toward Q2310-3358 at z = 2.40</title>

Abstract: Quasar absorption systems not only affect the way quasars are selected, but also serve as key probes of galaxies, providing insight into their chemical evolution and interstellar medium (ISM). Recently, a method based on Gaia astrometric measurements has aided the selection of quasars reddened by dust hitherto overlooked. We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on one such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z = 2.3909\pm0.0022$, is associated with a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) at nearly the same redshift $2.4007\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column density of $\log N(HI)=21.214\pm0.003$. The DLA is very metal-rich (close to solar metallicity after correction for depletion on dust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the mass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs. Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived kinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV radiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in close proximity, i.e., part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in the same overdensity of galaxies. We used the line ratios of the fine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Our analysis extends the understanding of $z_{abs} \approx z_{em}$ absorption line systems and provides valuable constraints on the interplay between dust, metals, and neutral gas in the ISM of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim1$ and their connection with dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ,f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. Compared with their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that $f_{\rm j}$ shows little redshift evolution and depends very weakly on $M_\ast$, with typical values around $f_{\rm j}\sim0.8$. As for $f_{\rm M}$, we find it to be higher and less dependent on $M_\ast$ at $z=0.9$ than at $z=0$. Interpreting our observed $f_{\rm M}-M_\ast$ relations within the Cold Dark Matter framework implies necessarily that the galaxy populations at $z=0.9$ and $z=0$ are not the progenitor/descendant of one another. The alternative scenario is that the $z=0.9$ relations are incorrect due to strong selection effects, unidentified systematics, or the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics may not be a reliable dynamical tracer. Such problems would also affect previous studies on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves</title>

Abstract: Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" ($1\sigma$). This result reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\alpha$ line at SNR $\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty could improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way stellar halo is twisted and doubly broken: insights from DESI DR2 Milky Way Survey observation</title>

Abstract: Using K giants from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Milky Way (MW) Survey, we measure the shape, orientation, radial profile, and density anisotropies of the MW stellar halo over 8 kpc$&lt;r_\mathrm{GC}&lt;200$ kpc. We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\sim16$ kpc and $\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($&lt;30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended. Our results provide important clues to the assembly and evolution of the MW stellar halo under the standard cosmic structure formation framework.</description>

      <title>Concept integral field unit spectrometer instrument for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have primarily probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for entire samples. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths approaching the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such integral field unit spectrometers can resolve and identify redshifts for up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a collaboration open-source initiative to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations, dynamical heating and tidal disruption in spin $s$ ultralight dark matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 ultralight dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting haloes after they merge. Our findings reveal that higher spin lead to broader, less dense haloes with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of solitons involved. Additionally, we study the process of dynamical heating for these haloes, and find that the heating time-scale for higher spin increases order an of magnitude compared to the spin 0 case. Then, we identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core-NFW of spin~$s$ ULDM haloes as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{\text{sol}}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent haloes based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{\text{sol}}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of an ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host haloes having the same average density, the disruption time of the satellite is as predicted for a uniform sphere regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, whereas for haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Anatomy of a water-rich, inclined, brown dwarf disk: lack of abundant hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of MIRI, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>The fate of the progenitors of luminous red novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592</link>

Abstract: We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic luminous red novae (LRNe) discovered in the past three decades. In all of these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. However, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR) and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of AT 1997bs is consistent with that of an orange giant star with a photospheric temperature of 3750-4250 K and a radius of 120-150 $R_{\odot}$, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation. Similarly, the SED of AT 2019zhd after three years is compatible with a red supergiant star with $T_{ph}=3100\pm100$ K and $R=350\pm50$ $R_{\odot}$. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. Its SED, with two excesses at 1.8 and 7.7 $\mu$m, can be explained by a cold ($T\sim450$ K) dusty shell composed of amorphous carbon surrounding a cold expanded source, plus emission from the Pa$\alpha$ line. We constructed the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to more than 7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: The MIR colour is $\sim-0.5$ mag before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer after around one year, and then it gradually turns to redder colours before reaching $\sim+1.0$ mag after 7 years. We also estimated the masses and the temperatures of newly formed dust years after the LRN onset. We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (1-5)x$10^{-4}$ (and up to 2x$10^{-3}$) $M_{\odot}$ between 7 and 13 years after the outbursts. Finally, we find that the remnants of LRNe detected years or decades after the merger are expanded and cool objects, similar to red supergiant stars.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency using ArCTIc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. The type of damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all stabilised into one of three configurations. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>WIYN Open Cluster Study. XCVII. An Extended Radial-Velocity Survey and Spectroscopic Binary Orbits in the Open Cluster NGC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 35 new spectroscopic-binary orbits from our extended radial-velocity (RV) survey of the old ($6.4 \pm 0.2$ Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. Using data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) and APOGEE-2, this work nearly doubles the temporal baseline of the previous RV study of NGC 188. We obtain orbital solutions within a stellar sample that spans a magnitude range of {$10.8 \leq \mathrm{G} \leq 16.5 \; (0.9\mbox{-}1.2 \; {M_\odot})$}. With revised membership determinations using Gaia DR3 proper-motions and parallaxes, we reassess the cluster binary frequency and period-eccentricity distribution. The incompleteness-corrected binary frequency is $33.1 \% \pm 3.8\%$ for periods less than $10^4$ days, and the tidal-circularization period is $14.4^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ days. We find evidence that giants are deficient in short-period orbits, and suggest that the missing giants may have undergone mass transfer and in part formed the population of blue straggler stars (BSSs) and blue lurkers. Among the binaries of note, we highlight WOCS 3953 as a blue lurker candidate, WOCS 5020 and WOCS 4945 as very long-period eccentric BSSs, and WOCS 4230, a BSS with a very close WD companion.</description>

      <title>SN 2025coe: A Multiple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display {multiple} distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a {possible} late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.</description>

      <title>Formation of protostars and the launching of stellar core outflows with moving-mesh radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}&gt; 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small (&lt;0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</description>
