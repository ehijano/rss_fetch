      <title>A Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical System for Smoothing Noisy Eye Gaze Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenges associated with accurately determining gaze location on a screen, which is often compromised by noise from factors such as eye tracker limitations, calibration drift, ambient lighting changes, and eye blinks. We propose the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to smooth the gaze data collected during eye-tracking experiments, and systematically explore the interaction of different system parameters. Our results demonstrate that the EKF significantly reduces noise, leading to a marked improvement in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our proposed stochastic nonlinear dynamical model aligns well with real experimental data and holds promise for applications in related fields.</description>

      <title>The role of boundary constraints in simulating a nonlocal Gray-Scott model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present second-order algorithms to approximate the solution of a nonlocal Gray-Scott model that is known to generate interesting spatio-temporal structures such as pulse and stripes solutions. Our algorithms rely on a quadrature method for the spatial discretization and the method of lines using a second-order Adams-Bashforth for the time marching. We focus on studying the impact of the type of boundary constraints, e.g. nonlocal Dirichlet/Neumann or local periodic, and the type of nonlocal diffusion, i.e. integral operator with thin- or fat-tailed kernels, on the generation of pulse solutions. Our numerical investigations show that when the spread of the kernel is large, i.e. when the model is nonlocal, both the type of kernels and type of boundary constraints have a strong impact on the solutions profiles.</description>

      <title>Multiharmonic algorithms for contrast-enhanced ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic generation plays a crucial role in contrast-enhanced ultrasound, both for imaging and therapeutic applications. However, accurately capturing these nonlinear effects is computationally very demanding when using traditional time-domain approaches. To address this issue, in this work, we develop algorithms based on a time discretization that uses a multiharmonic Ansatz applied to a model that couples the Westervelt equation for acoustic pressure with a volume-based approximation of the Rayleigh--Plesset equation for the dynamics of microbubble contrast agents. We first rigorously establish the existence of time-periodic solutions for this Westervelt-ODE system. We then derive a multiharmonic representation of the system under time-periodic excitation and develop iterative algorithms that rely on the successive computation of higher harmonics under the assumption of real-valued or complex solution fields. In the real-valued setting, we characterize the approximation error in terms of the number of harmonics and a contribution owing to the fixed-point iteration. Finally, we investigate these algorithms numerically and illustrate how the number of harmonics and presence of microbubbles influence the propagation of acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Geometric adaptive smoothed aggregation multigrid for discontinuous Galerkin discretisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric multigrid solver based on adaptive smoothed aggregation suitable for Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations. Mesh hierarchies are formed via domain decomposition techniques, and the method is applicable to fully unstructured meshes using arbitrary element shapes. Furthermore, the method can be employed for a wide range of commonly used DG numerical fluxes for first- and second-order PDEs including the Interior Penalty and the Local Discontinuous Galerkin methods. We demonstrate excellent and mesh-independent convergence for a range of problems including the Poisson equation, and convection-diffusion for a range of P\'eclet numbers.</description>

      <title>The generalized scalar auxiliary variable applied to the incompressible Boussinesq Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a second-order time discretization for solving the incompressible Boussinesq equation. It uses the generalized scalar auxiliary variable (GSAV) and a backward differentiation formula (BDF), based on a Taylor expansion around $t^{n+k}$ for $k\geq3$. An exponential time integrator is used for the auxiliary variable to ensure stability independent of the time step size. We give rigorous asymptotic error estimates of the time-stepping scheme, thereby justifying its accuracy and stability. The scheme is reformulated into one amenable to a $H^1$-conforming finite element discretization. Finally, we validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments using a Taylor--Hood-based finite element discretization and show its applicability to large-scale 3-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.</description>

      <title>A global structure-preserving kernel method for the learning of Poisson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A structure-preserving kernel ridge regression method is presented that allows the recovery of globally defined, potentially high-dimensional, and nonlinear Hamiltonian functions on Poisson manifolds out of datasets made of noisy observations of Hamiltonian vector fields. The proposed method is based on finding the solution of a non-standard kernel ridge regression where the observed data is generated as the noisy image by a vector bundle map of the differential of the function that one is trying to estimate. Additionally, it is shown how a suitable regularization solves the intrinsic non-identifiability of the learning problem due to the degeneracy of the Poisson tensor and the presence of Casimir functions. A full error analysis is conducted that provides convergence rates using fixed and adaptive regularization parameters. The good performance of the proposed estimator is illustrated with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite difference schemes for Hamilton--Jacobi equation on Wasserstein space on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes and studies numerical schemes for initial value problems of Hamilton--Jacobi equations (HJEs) with a graph individual noise on the Wasserstein space on graphs. Numerically solving such equations is particularly challenging due to the structural complexity caused by discrete geometric derivatives and logarithmic geometry. Our numerical schemes are constructed using finite difference approximations that are adapted to both the discrete geometry of graphs and the differential structure of Wasserstein spaces. To ensure numerical stability and accuracy of numerical behavior, we use extrapolation-type techniques to simulate the numerical solution on the boundary of density space. By analyzing approximation error of Wasserstein gradient of the viscosity solution, we prove the uniform convergence of the schemes to the original initial value problem, and establish an $L^{\infty}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-error estimate of order one-half. Several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical findings and to study the effect of individual noise and Hamiltonians on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on numerical schemes for HJEs on the Wasserstein space with a graph structure.</description>

      <title>Adaptive time-stepping and maximum-principle preserving Lagrangian schemes for gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop in this paper an adaptive time-stepping approach for gradient flows with distinct treatments for conservative and non-conservative dynamics. For the non-conservative gradient flows in Lagrangian coordinates, we propose a modified formulation augmented by auxiliary terms to guarantee positivity of the determinant, and prove that the corresponding adaptive second-order Backward Difference Formulas (BDF2) scheme preserves energy stability and the maximum principle under the time-step ratio constraint $0&lt;r_n\le r_{\max}\le\frac{3}{2}$. On the other hand, for the conservative Wasserstein gradient flows in Lagrangian coordinates, we propose an adaptive BDF2 scheme which is shown to be energy dissipative, and positivity preserving under the time-step ratio constraint $0&lt;r_n\le r_{\max}\le\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}$ in 1D and $0&lt;r_n\le r_{\max}\le \frac{5}{4}$ in 2D, respectively. We also present ample numerical simulations in 1D and 2D to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Gevrey class regularity for steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in parametric domains and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parameteric Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous, incompressible flow in bounded domains. The coefficients of the equations are perturbed by high-dimensional random parameters, this fits in particular for modelling flows in domains with uncertain perturbations. Our focus is on deriving bounds for arbitrary high-order derivatives of the pressure and the velocity fields with respect to the random parameters in the context of incompressible Navier-Stokes equation under a small-data assumption. To achieve this, we analyze mixed and saddle-point problems and employ the alternative-to-factorial technique to establish generalized Gevrey-class regularity for the solution pair. Thereby the analytic regularity follows as a special case. In the numerical experiments, we validate and illustrate our theoretical findings using Gauss-Legendre quadrature and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>A Fast Direct Solver for Boundary Integral Equations Using Quadrature By Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a hierarchical direct solver for linear systems arising from the discretization of boundary integral equations using the Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) method. Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning FEM discretisations of the high-frequency Maxwell equations by either perturbing the coefficients or adding absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove bounds on $\mathsf{I} - \mathsf{A}_2^{-1}\mathsf{A}_1$ where $\mathsf{A}_\ell$, $\ell=1,2$, are the Galerkin matrices corresponding to finite-element discretisations of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations $k^{-2}{\rm curl} (\mu_\ell^{-1}{\rm curl} E_\ell) - \epsilon_\ell E_\ell =f$; i.e., we consider the situation where the Maxwell FEM matrix is preconditioned by the FEM matrix arising from the same Maxwell problem but with different coefficients. An important special case is when the perturbation consists of adding absorption (in the spirit of "shifted Laplacian preconditioning" for the Helmholtz equation). The results of this paper are the Maxwell analogues of the Helmholtz results in [Gander, Graham, Spence, 2015] and [Graham, Pembery, Spence, 2021], and confirm a conjecture in the recent preprint [Li, Hu, arXiv 2501.18305]. These results are obtained by putting the Maxwell problem in an abstract framework that also includes the Helmholtz problem; as a byproduct we weaken the assumptions required to obtain the Helmholtz results in [Gander, Graham, Spence, 2015] and [Graham, Pembery, Spence, 2021].</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design via Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving scheme for the quantum Liouville-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in this work in the numerical resolution of the Quantum Liouville-BGK equation, which arises in the derivation of quantum hydrodynamical models from first principles. Such models are often obtained in some asymptotic limits, for instance a diffusion or a fluid limit, and as a consequence the original Liouville equation contains small parameters. A standard method such as a split-step algorithm is then accurate provided the time step is sufficiently small compared to the asymptotic parameter, which is a severe limitation. In the case of the diffusion limit, we propose a numerical method that is accurate for time steps independent of the small parameter, and which captures well both the microscopic dynamics and the diffusion limit. Our approach is substantiated by an informal theoretical error analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JKO scheme provides the discrete-in-time approximation for the solutions of evolutionary equations with Wasserstein gradient structure. We study a natural space-discretization of this scheme by restricting the minimization to the measures supported on the nodes of a regular grid. The study of the fully discrete JKO scheme is motivated by the applications to developing numerical schemes for the nonlinear diffusion equation with drift and the crowd motion model. The main result of this paper is the convergence of the scheme as both the time and space discretization parameters tend to zero in a suitable regime.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Irregular Sampling in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the convergence of sampling algorithms for functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). To this end, we discuss approximation properties of kernel regression under minimalistic assumptions on both the kernel and the input data. We first prove error estimates in the kernel's RKHS norm. This leads us to new results concerning uniform convergence of kernel regression on compact domains. For Lipschitz continuous and H\"older continuous kernels, we prove convergence rates.</description>

      <title>A note on the growth factor in Gaussian elimination for Higham matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5211</link>
      <description>arXiv:1305.5211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higham matrix is a complex symmetric matrix A=B+iC, where both B and C are real, symmetric and positive definite and $\mathrm{i}=\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit. For any Higham matrix A, Ikramov et al. showed that the growth factor in Gaussian elimination is less than 3. In this paper, based on the previous results, a new bound of the growth factor is obtained by using the maximum of the condition numbers of matrixes B and C for the generalized Higham matrix A, which strengthens this bound to 2 and proves the Higham's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Algorithms for Neural Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greedy algorithms have been successfully analyzed and applied in training neural networks for solving variational problems, ensuring guaranteed convergence orders. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA) to convex optimization problems, establishing its optimal convergence rate. This result broadens the applicability of OGA by generalizing its optimal convergence rate from function approximation to convex optimization problems. In addition, we also address the issue regarding practical applicability of greedy algorithms, which is due to significant computational costs from the subproblems that involve an exhaustive search over a discrete dictionary. We propose to use a more practical approach of randomly discretizing the dictionary at each iteration of the greedy algorithm. We quantify the required size of the randomized discrete dictionary and prove that, with high probability, the proposed algorithm realizes a weak greedy algorithm, achieving optimal convergence orders. Through numerous numerical experiments on function approximation, linear and nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations, we validate our analysis on the optimal convergence rate and demonstrate the advantage of using randomized discrete dictionaries over a deterministic one by showing orders of magnitude reductions in the size of the discrete dictionary, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixed-Precision Real Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating real-valued expressions to high precision is a key building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. A typical implementation evaluates the whole expression in a uniform precision, doubling that precision until a sufficiently-accurate result is achieved. This is wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could be computed much faster. However, such non-uniform precision assignments have, to date, been impractical to compute. We propose a fast new algorithm for deriving such precision assignments. The algorithm leverages results computed at lower precisions to analytically determine a mixed-precision assignment that will result in a sufficiently-accurate result. Our implementation, Reval, achieves an average speed-up of 1.72x compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya tool, with the speed-up increasing to 5.21x on the most difficult input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without precision tuning shows that the speed-up results from assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations, though additional optimizations enabled by the non-uniform precision assignments also play a role.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with Domain Transformation for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in quantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the integrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that typically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing Fourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor product (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to $[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at the corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation procedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The proposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original integrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs, and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain for options with up to 15 assets.</description>
