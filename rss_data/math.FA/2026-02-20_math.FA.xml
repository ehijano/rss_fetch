      <title>Perturbation analysis of tensor $(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{C})$-inverse via Einstein product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a relatively small perturbation on various generalized inverses functions or quantities derived from a tensor $\mathcal{A}$.When a small tensor perturbation \(\mathcal{E}\) is introduced, it becomes challenging to analyze generalized inverses of the perturbed tensor \( \mathcal{D} =\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{E}\) and to determine how this perturbation affects a generalized inverse of $\mathcal{A}$.Our main goal is to understand the relationship between $\mathcal{D}^\Game$ and \( \mathcal{A}^\Game \), where $(\cdot)^\Game$ denotes a specific generalized inverse or a class of generalized inverses.In particular, classes of tensor inner, outer, and $(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{C})$ inverses are considered.</description>

      <title>Product Hardy Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type: Discrete Product Calder\'on-Type Reproducing Formula, Atomic Characterization, and Product Calder\'on--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $i\in\{1,2\}$ and $X_i$ be a space of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss with the upper dimension $\omega_i$. Also let $\eta_i$ be the smoothness index of the Auscher--Hyt\"onen wavelet function $\psi^{k_i}_{\alpha_i}$ on $X_i$. In this article, for any $p\in(\max\{\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_1+\eta_1},\frac{\omega_2}{\omega_2+\eta_2}\}, 1]$, by regarding the product Carleson measure space $\mathrm{CMO}^p_{L^2}(X_1\times X_2)$ as the test function space and its dual space $(\mathrm{CMO}^p_{L^2}(X_1\times X_2))'$ as the corresponding distribution space, we introduce the product Hardy space $H^p(X_1\times X_2)$ in terms of wavelet coefficients. Moreover, we establish an atomic characterization of this product Hardy space and, as an application, obtain a criterion for the boundedness of linear operators from product Hardy spaces to corresponding Lebesgue spaces. To escape the wavelet reproducing formula, which is not useful for this atomic characterization because the wavelets have no bounded support, we establish a new discrete product Calder\'on-type reproducing formula, which holds in the product Hardy space and has bounded support. This reproducing formula also leads to the boundedness of product Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on the product Hardy space.</description>

      <title>Smoothing on $L^1$ for ground state transformed semigroups in non-local settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^1$-smoothing properties for a broad class of semigroups arising from the ground state transformation of Schr\"odinger semigroups with confining potentials associated with non-local L\'evy operators, for which (asymptotic) ultracontractivity and hypercontractivity fail. Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the L\'evy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \uparrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>The optimal hypercontractive constants for $\mathbb{Z}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a folklore problem for the optimal hypercontractive constant of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_3$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; \infty$. Precisely, the optimal hypercontractive constant is given by \[ r_{p,q}(\mathbb{Z}_3) = \frac{(1 + 2x)(1 - y)}{(1 + 2y)(1 - x)}, \] where $(x,y)$ is the $\textit{unique}$ solution in the open unit square $(0,1)\times (0,1)$ to the system of equations \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\frac{1}{1+2x}\Big(\frac{1+2x^p}{3}\Big)^{\frac{1}{p}}=\frac{1}{1+2y}\Big(\frac{1+2y^q}{3}\Big)^{\frac{1}{q}},\\ &amp;\frac{(1-x)(1-x^{p-1})}{1+2x^p}=\frac{(1-y)(1-y^{q-1})}{1+2y^q}. \end{aligned} \right. \end{align*} One feature of our formalism is that the system simultaneously determines the optimal hypercontractive constant and a nontrivial extremizer. As a consequence of our main result, for rational $p, q\in \mathbb{Q}$, the constants $r_{p,q}(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ are algebraic numbers whose minimal polynomials are generally rather complicated, with non-solvable Galois groups and therefore no explicit radical expressions.</description>

      <title>Localised Operator Valued Kernels Invariant under Actions of $*$-Semigroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider positive semidefinite kernels which have values given by bounded linear operators on certain bundles of Hilbert spaces and which are invariant under actions of $*$-semigroupoids. For these kernels, we prove that there exist generalised $*$-representations of the $*$-semigroupoids on the underlying reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces or, equivalently, on the underlying minimal linearisations, we characterise when the $*$-representations are performed by means of bounded operators and show that this always happens for inverse semigroupoids. Then, we consider Hermitian kernels which have values given by bounded linear operators on certain bundles of Hilbert spaces and which are invariant under actions of $*$-semigroupoids. Only those Hermitian kernels having certain boundedness properties can produce reproducing kernel Krein spaces but uniqueness is more complicated. However, for these kernels, generalised $*$-representations can be obtained. If $*$-representations with bounded linear operators are requested, then stronger boundedness conditions on the kernels are needed.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures featuring graph dimensions, H\"older regularity, and fractional differentiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the algebraic genericity of various families of continuous functions exhibiting extreme irregularity, focusing on fractal dimensions, H\"older regularity, and fractional differentiability. Our first main result shows that for every $s \in (1,s]$, the set of continuous functions on $[0, 1]$ whose graph has Hausdorff and box dimensions equal to s is strongly $\mathfrak{c}$-algebrable, thereby tackling an open question by Bonilla et al., and complementing recent findings by Liu et. al and Carmona et al. We then extend the analysis to H\"older spaces: although the pointwise H\"older exponent of a generic function in $C^{\alpha}[0, 1]$ is constant, we prove that the collection of functions realizing this behavior is $\mathfrak{c}$-lineable but cannot form an algebra. Nevertheless, we construct strongly $\mathfrak{c}$-algebrable families of functions that exhibit H\"older exponent $\alpha$ outside a set of Hausdorff dimension zero. Finally, as a consequence of the relation between strongly monoH\"older functions and fractional differentiability, we analyze the strong $\mathfrak{c}$-algebrability of nowhere (Riemann-Liouville) fractional differentiable functions.</description>

      <title>The behaviour of quasi-linear maps on $C(K)$-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we combine topological and functional analysis methods to prove that a non-locally trivial quasi-linear map defined on a $C(K)$ must be nontrivial on a subspace isomorphic to $c_0$. We conclude the paper with a few examples showing that the result is optimal, and providing an application to the existence of nontrivial twisted sums of $\ell_1$ and $c_0$.</description>

      <title>Invertibility of the Fourier Diffraction Relation in Raster Scan Diffraction Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography aims to recover an object's scattering potential from measured wave fields. In the classical setting, the object is illuminated by plane waves from many directions, and the Fourier diffraction theorem gives a direct relation between the Fourier transform of the scattering potential of the object and the Fourier transformed measurements.
  In many practical imaging systems, however, focused beams are used instead of plane waves. These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential.
  This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations. We show that in dimensions higher than two, all coefficients appearing in the equations are typically uniquely determined. In two dimensions, however, only part of the Fourier coverage is uniquely recoverable, while on the remaining subset, distinct coefficients can produce identical data.</description>

      <title>Raster Scan Diffraction Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography is a widely used inverse scattering technique for quantitative imaging of weakly scattering media. In its conventional formulation, diffraction tomography assumes monochromatic plane wave illumination. This assumption, however, represents a simplification that often fails to reflect practical imaging systems such as medical ultrasound, where focused beams are used to scan a region of interest of the human body. Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory. Within this setting, we derive a new Fourier diffraction relation, which forms the basis for quantitative tomographic reconstruction from scanning data. Using this result, we systematically analyze how different scan geometries influence the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium functional inequalities for finite Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional inequalities such as the Poincar\'e and log-Sobolev inequalities quantify convergence to equilibrium in continuous-time Markov chains by linking generator properties to variance and entropy decay. However, many applications, including multiscale and non-reversible dynamics, require analysing probability measures that are not at equilibrium, where the classical theory tied to steady states no longer applies. We introduce generalised versions of these inequalities for arbitrary positive measures on a finite state space, retaining key structural properties of their classical counterparts. In particular, we prove continuity of the associated constants with respect to the reference measure and establish explicit positive lower bounds. As an application, we derive quantitative coarse-graining error estimates for non-reversible Markov chains, both with and without explicit scale separation, and propose a quantitative criterion for assessing the quality of coarse-graining maps.</description>

Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants for spaces of bihomogeneous harmonic and bihomogeneous polynomials on the unit sphere in finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. Using averaging techniques, we demonstrate that the minimal norm projection aligns with the natural orthogonal projection. This result enables us to establish a connection between these constants and weighted \linebreak $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. Consequently, we derive explicit bounds, provide practical expressions for computation, and present asymptotically sharp estimates for these constants. Our findings extend the classical Ryll and Wojtaszczyk formula for the projection constant of homogeneous polynomials in finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces to the bihomogeneous setting.</description>

Abstract: Using elementary techniques from Geometric Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, and Abelian $C^*$ Algebras, we uncover a novel, yet familiar, global geometric invariant -- namely the indexed set of integrals of triple products of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, to precisely characterize which isospectral closed Riemannian manifolds are isometric.</description>

      <title>C*-submodule preserving module mappings on Hilbert C*-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a (non-unital, in general) C*-algebra with center $Z(M(A))$ of its multiplier algebra, and let $\{ X, \langle .,. \rangle \}$ be a full Hilbert $A$-module. Then any bijective bounded module morphism $T$, for which every norm-closed $A$-submodule of $X$ is invariant, is of the form $T=d \cdot {\rm id}_X$ where $d \in Z(M(A))$ is invertible. As an example of a merely injective bounded module operator with that preserver property serves $T =d \cdot {\rm id}_X$ where $|d| \in Z(M(A))$ has a positive spectrum, but not bounded away from zero. The same assertions are true if the restriction on the C*-submodules to be norm-closed is dropped. From a different point of view, for two given strongly Morita equivalent C*-algebras $A$ and $B$ and a Hilbert $B$-$A$ bimodule $\{ X, \langle .,. \rangle \}$ with faithful compact right action of $B$, for any two two-sided norm-closed ideals $I \in A$, $J \in B$, any full compatible norm-closed Hilbert $J$-$I$ subbimodule of $X$ is invariant for any left bounded $B$-module operator and any right bounded $A$-module operator. So these subsets of submodules of $X$ cannot rule out any bounded module operator as a non-preserver of that subset collection, however any single element of this subset collection is preserved by any bounded module operator on $X$. For any $B$-$A$ imprimitivity bimodule both the C*-valued inner product values are always preserved by bijective bounded module operators $T$ on $X$ iff $T= u \cdot {\rm id}_X$ for a unitary element $u\in Z(M(A))$.</description>
