      <title>What is Metaheuristics? A Primer for the Epidemiologists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization plays an important role in tackling public health problems. Animal instincts can be used effectively to solve complex public health management issues by providing optimal or approximately optimal solutions to complicated optimization problems common in public health. BAT algorithm is an exemplary member of a class of nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms and designed to outperform existing metaheuristic algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It's inspiration comes from the foraging behavior of group of microbats that use echolocation to find their target in the surrounding environment. In recent years, BAT algorithm has been extensively used by researchers in the area of optimization, and various variants of BAT algorithm have been developed to improve its performance and extend its application to diverse disciplines. This paper first reviews the basic BAT algorithm and its variants, including their applications in various fields. As a specific application, we apply the BAT algorithm to a biostatistical estimation problem and show it has some clear advantages over existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Capacity Fixed-Charge Flow Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Capacity Fixed-Charge Network Flow (MC-FCNF) problem, a generalization of the Fixed-Charge Network Flow problem, aims to assign capacities to edges in a flow network such that a target amount of flow can be hosted at minimum cost. The cost model for both problems dictates that the fixed cost of an edge is incurred for any non-zero amount of flow hosted by that edge. This problem naturally arises in many areas including infrastructure design, transportation, telecommunications, and supply chain management. The MC-FCNF problem is NP-Hard, so solving large instances using exact techniques is impractical. This paper presents a genetic algorithm designed to quickly find high-quality flow solutions to the MC-FCNF problem. The genetic algorithm uses a novel solution representation scheme that eliminates the need to repair invalid flow solutions, which is an issue common to many other genetic algorithms for the MC-FCNF problem. The genetic algorithm's efficiency is displayed with an evaluation using real-world CO2 capture and storage infrastructure design data. The evaluation results highlight the genetic algorithm's potential for solving large-scale network design problems.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based context aware continual learning for spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological brains have the capability to adaptively coordinate relevant neuronal populations based on the task context to learn continuously changing tasks in real-world environments. However, existing spiking neural network-based continual learning algorithms treat each task equally, ignoring the guiding role of different task similarity associations for network learning, which limits knowledge utilization efficiency. Inspired by the context-dependent plasticity mechanism of the brain, we propose a Similarity-based Context Aware Spiking Neural Network (SCA-SNN) continual learning algorithm to efficiently accomplish task incremental learning and class incremental learning. Based on contextual similarity across tasks, the SCA-SNN model can adaptively reuse neurons from previous tasks that are beneficial for new tasks (the more similar, the more neurons are reused) and flexibly expand new neurons for the new task (the more similar, the fewer neurons are expanded). Selective reuse and discriminative expansion significantly improve the utilization of previous knowledge and reduce energy consumption. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR100, ImageNet generalized datasets, and FMNIST-MNIST, SVHN-CIFAR100 mixed datasets show that our SCA-SNN model achieves superior performance compared to both SNN-based and DNN-based continual learning algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm has the capability to adaptively select similar groups of neurons for related tasks, offering a promising approach to enhancing the biological interpretability of efficient continual learning.</description>

      <title>SkipSNN: Efficiently Classifying Spike Trains with Event-attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike train classification has recently become an important topic in the machine learning community, where each spike train is a binary event sequence with \emph{temporal-sparsity of signals of interest} and \emph{temporal-noise} properties. A promising model for it should follow the design principle of performing intensive computation only when signals of interest appear. So such tasks use mainly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to their consideration of temporal-sparsity of spike trains. However, the basic mechanism of SNNs ignore the temporal-noise issue, which makes them computationally expensive and thus high power consumption for analyzing spike trains on resource-constrained platforms. As an event-driven model, an SNN neuron makes a reaction given any input signals, making it difficult to quickly find signals of interest. In this paper, we introduce an event-attention mechanism that enables SNNs to dynamically highlight useful signals of the original spike trains. To this end, we propose SkipSNN, which extends existing SNN models by learning to mask out noise by skipping membrane potential updates and shortening the effective size of the computational graph. This process is analogous to how people choose to open and close their eyes to filter the information they see. We evaluate SkipSNN on various neuromorphic tasks and demonstrate that it achieves significantly better computational efficiency and classification accuracy than other state-of-the-art SNNs.</description>

      <title>Learning Characteristics of Reverse Quaternion Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural network model architecture, Reverse Quaternion Neural Network which utilizes the non-commutative nature of quaternion products, and to clarify its learning characteristics. While quaternion neural networks have been used in various fields, there has been no research report on the characteristics of multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural networks where weights are applied in the reverse direction. This paper investigates the learning characteristics of the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network from two perspectives: the learning speed and the generalization on rotation. As a result, it is found that the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network has a learning speed comparable to existing models and can obtain a different rotation representation from the existing models.</description>

      <title>Guiding Genetic Programming with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary computation, it is commonly assumed that a search algorithm acquires knowledge about a problem instance by sampling solutions from the search space and evaluating them with a fitness function. This is necessarily inefficient because fitness reveals very little about solutions -- yet they contain more information that can be potentially exploited. To address this observation in genetic programming, we propose EvoNUDGE, which uses a graph neural network to elicit additional knowledge from symbolic regression problems. The network is queried on the problem before an evolutionary run to produce a library of subprograms, which is subsequently used to seed the initial population and bias the actions of search operators. In an extensive experiment on a large number of problem instances, EvoNUDGE is shown to significantly outperform multiple baselines, including the conventional tree-based genetic programming and the purely neural variant of the method.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Deep Learning: Non-backpropagation and Non-optimization Machine Learning Approach Using Hebbian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing strong AI could provide a powerful tool for addressing social and scientific challenges. Neural networks (NNs), inspired by biological systems, have the potential to achieve this. However, weight optimization techniques using error backpropagation are not observed in biological systems, raising doubts about current NNs approaches. In this context, Itoh (2024) solved the MNIST classification problem without using objective functions or backpropagation. However, weight updates were not used, so it does not qualify as machine learning AI. In this study, I develop a machine learning method that mimics biological neural systems by implementing Hebbian learning in NNs without backpropagation and optimization method to solve the MNIST classification problem and analyze its output. Development proceeded in three stages. In the first stage, I applied the Hebbian learning rule to the MNIST character recognition algorithm by Itoh (2024), resulting in lower accuracy than non-Hebbian NNs, highlighting the limitations of conventional training procedures for Hebbian learning. In the second stage, I examined the properties of individually trained NNs using norm-based cognition, showing that NNs trained on a specific label respond powerfully to that label. In the third stage, I created an MNIST character recognition program using vector norm magnitude as the criterion, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75%. This demonstrates that the Hebbian learning NNs can recognize handwritten characters without objective functions, backpropagation, or optimization processes. Based on these results, developing a mechanism based on norm-based cognition as a fundamental unit and then increasing complexity to achieve indirect similarity cognition should help mimic biological neural systems and contribute to realizing strong AI.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Metaheuristics Through Opposition-Based Learning in Optimum Locating of Control Systems in Tall Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opposition-based learning (OBL) is an effective approach to improve the performance of metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which are commonly used for solving complex engineering problems. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of opposition strategies in metaheuristic optimization algorithms, discussing the benefits and limitations of this approach. An overview of the opposition strategy concept, its various implementations, and its impact on the performance of metaheuristic algorithms are presented. Furthermore, case studies on the application of opposition strategies in engineering problems are provided, including the optimum locating of control systems in tall building. A shear frame with Magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper is considered as a case study. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of opposition strategies in metaheuristic algorithms significantly enhances the quality and speed of the optimization process. This chapter aims to provide a clear understanding of the opposition strategy in metaheuristic optimization algorithms and its engineering applications, with the ultimate goal of facilitating its adoption in real-world engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm and Its Application on the Optimum Design of Steel Structures with Semi-rigid Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An improved bilinear fuzzy genetic algorithm (BFGA) is introduced in this chapter for the design optimization of steel structures with semi-rigid connections. Semi-rigid connections provide a compromise between the stiffness of fully rigid connections and the flexibility of fully pinned connections. However, designing such structures is challenging due to the nonlinear behavior of semi-rigid connections. The BFGA is a robust optimization method that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm to handle the complexity and uncertainties of structural design problems. The BFGA, compared to standard GA, demonstrated to generate high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. The application of the BFGA is demonstrated through the optimization of steel structures with semirigid connections, considering the weight and performance criteria. The results show that the proposed BFGA is capable of finding optimal designs that satisfy all the design requirements and constraints. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for the optimization of complex structures with nonlinear behavior.</description>

      <title>MBL-CPDP: A Multi-objective Bilevel Method for Cross-Project Defect Prediction via Automated Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to proactively identify software defects, especially where project-specific data is scarce. However, developing a robust ML pipeline with optimal hyperparameters that effectively use cross-project information and yield satisfactory performance remains challenging. In this paper, we resolve this bottleneck by formulating CPDP as a multi-objective bilevel optimization (MBLO) method, dubbed MBL-CPDP. It comprises two nested problems: the upper-level, a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, enhances robustness and efficiency in optimizing ML pipelines, while the lower-level problem is an expensive optimization problem that focuses on tuning their optimal hyperparameters. Due to the high-dimensional search space characterized by feature redundancy and inconsistent data distributions, the upper-level problem combines feature selection, transfer learning, and classification to leverage limited and heterogeneous historical data. Meanwhile, an ensemble learning method is proposed to capture differences in cross-project distribution and generalize across diverse datasets. Finally, a MBLO algorithm is presented to solve this problem while achieving high adaptability effectively. To evaluate the performance of MBL-CPDP, we compare it with five automated ML tools and $50$ CPDP techniques across $20$ projects. Extensive empirical results show that MBL-CPDPoutperforms the comparison methods, demonstrating its superior adaptability and comprehensive performance evaluation capability.</description>

      <title>Evolving Efficient Genetic Encoding for Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exploiting discrete signal processing and simulating brain neuron communication, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a low-energy alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNN models, still face high computational costs due to the numerous time steps as well as network depth and scale. The tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses in the human brain are developed from only 20,000 genes, which inspires us to design an efficient genetic encoding strategy that dynamic evolves to regulate large-scale deep SNNs at low cost. Therefore, we first propose a genetically scaled SNN encoding scheme that incorporates globally shared genetic interactions to indirectly optimize neuronal encoding instead of weight, which obviously brings about reductions in parameters and energy consumption. Then, a spatio-temporal evolutionary framework is designed to optimize the inherently initial wiring rules. Two dynamic regularization operators in the fitness function evolve the neuronal encoding to a suitable distribution and enhance information quality of the genetic interaction respectively, substantially accelerating evolutionary speed and improving efficiency. Experiments show that our approach compresses parameters by approximately 50\% to 80\%, while outperforming models on the same architectures by 0.21\% to 4.38\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. In summary, the consistent trends of the proposed genetically encoded spatio-temporal evolution across different datasets and architectures highlight its significant enhancements in terms of efficiency, broad scalability and robustness, demonstrating the advantages of the brain-inspired evolutionary genetic coding for SNN optimization.</description>

      <title>Randomized Forward Mode Gradient for Spiking Neural Networks in Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a promising approach in machine learning, combining the hierarchical learning capabilities of deep neural networks with the energy efficiency of spike-based computations. Traditional end-to-end training of SNNs is often based on back-propagation, where weight updates are derived from gradients computed through the chain rule. However, this method encounters challenges due to its limited biological plausibility and inefficiencies on neuromorphic hardware. In this study, we introduce an alternative training approach for SNNs. Instead of using back-propagation, we leverage weight perturbation methods within a forward-mode gradient framework. Specifically, we perturb the weight matrix with a small noise term and estimate gradients by observing the changes in the network output. Experimental results on regression tasks, including solving various PDEs, show that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, suggesting its suitability for neuromorphic systems and potential hardware compatibility.</description>

      <title>Learning Morphisms with Gauss-Newton Approximation for Growing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular method for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is based on growing networks via small local changes to the network's architecture called network morphisms. These methods start with a small seed network and progressively grow the network by adding new neurons in an automated way. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently determine which parts of the network are best to grow. Here we propose a NAS method for growing a network by using a Gauss-Newton approximation of the loss function to efficiently learn and evaluate candidate network morphisms. We compare our method with state of the art NAS methods for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks, and conclude our method learns similar quality or better architectures at a smaller computational cost.</description>

      <title>Poor Man's Training on MCUs: A Memory-Efficient Quantized Back-Propagation-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Back propagation (BP) is the default solution for gradient computation in neural network training. However, implementing BP-based training on various edge devices such as FPGA, microcontrollers (MCUs), and analog computing platforms face multiple major challenges, such as the lack of hardware resources, long time-to-market, and dramatic errors in a low-precision setting. This paper presents a simple BP-free training scheme on an MCU, which makes edge training hardware design as easy as inference hardware design. We adopt a quantized zeroth-order method to estimate the gradients of quantized model parameters, which can overcome the error of a straight-through estimator in a low-precision BP scheme. We further employ a few dimension reduction methods (e.g., node perturbation, sparse training) to improve the convergence of zeroth-order training. Experiment results show that our BP-free training achieves comparable performance as BP-based training on adapting a pre-trained image classifier to various corrupted data on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., an MCU with 1024-KB SRAM for dense full-model training, or an MCU with 256-KB SRAM for sparse training). This method is most suitable for application scenarios where memory cost and time-to-market are the major concerns, but longer latency can be tolerated.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Reflexivity Theory and Cognitive Social Structures on the Dynamics of Doctor-Patient Social System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional economic and socio-behavioural models assume perfect symmetric access to information and rational behaviour among interacting agents in a social system. However, real-world events and observations appear to contradict such assumptions, leading to the possibility of other, more complex interaction rules existing between such agents. We investigate this possibility by creating two different models for a doctor-patient system. One retains the established assumptions, while the other incorporates principles of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures. In addition, we utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behaviour of the physician and patient agents in both models. The differences in results for the two models suggest that social systems may not always exhibit the behaviour or even accomplish the purpose for which they were designed and that modelling the social and cognitive influences in a social system may capture various ways a social agent balances complementary and competing information signals in making choices.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural Nonlinearity in Binary Polariton-Based Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network's layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network's configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</description>

      <title>NeuReg: Domain-invariant 3D Image Registration on Human and Mouse Brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical brain imaging relies heavily on image registration to accurately curate structural boundaries of brain features for various healthcare applications. Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in image registration in recent years. Still, they often struggle to handle the diversity of 3D brain volumes, challenged by their structural and contrastive variations and their imaging domains. In this work, we present NeuReg, a Neuro-inspired 3D image registration architecture with the feature of domain invariance. NeuReg generates domain-agnostic representations of imaging features and incorporates a shifting window-based Swin Transformer block as the encoder. This enables our model to capture the variations across brain imaging modalities and species. We demonstrate a new benchmark in multi-domain publicly available datasets comprising human and mouse 3D brain volumes. Extensive experiments reveal that our model (NeuReg) outperforms the existing baseline deep learning-based image registration models and provides a high-performance boost on cross-domain datasets, where models are trained on 'source-only' domain and tested on completely 'unseen' target domains. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for domain-agnostic 3D brain image registration, underpinned by Neuro-inspired Transformer-based architecture.</description>

      <title>BayesNAM: Leveraging Inconsistency for Reliable Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural additive model (NAM) is a recently proposed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method that utilizes neural network-based architectures. Given the advantages of neural networks, NAMs provide intuitive explanations for their predictions with high model performance. In this paper, we analyze a critical yet overlooked phenomenon: NAMs often produce inconsistent explanations, even when using the same architecture and dataset. Traditionally, such inconsistencies have been viewed as issues to be resolved. However, we argue instead that these inconsistencies can provide valuable explanations within the given data model. Through a simple theoretical framework, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies are not mere artifacts but emerge naturally in datasets with multiple important features. To effectively leverage this information, we introduce a novel framework, Bayesian Neural Additive Model (BayesNAM), which integrates Bayesian neural networks and feature dropout, with theoretical proof demonstrating that feature dropout effectively captures model inconsistencies. Our experiments demonstrate that BayesNAM effectively reveals potential problems such as insufficient data or structural limitations of the model, providing more reliable explanations and potential remedies.</description>

      <title>Are Neuromorphic Architectures Inherently Privacy-preserving? An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are becoming mainstream, especially in sensitive application areas, the risk of data leakage has become a growing concern. Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models can reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic architectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as promising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven processing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied; however, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs. This paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs, we assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets. We analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and evolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN privacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy preservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For instance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than ANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs' 0.88. Additionally, we explore the privacy-utility trade-off with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), finding that SNNs sustain less accuracy loss than ANNs under similar privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Principles of ReLU Networks with One Hidden Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network with one hidden layer or a two-layer network (regardless of the input layer) is the simplest feedforward neural network, whose mechanism may be the basis of more general network architectures. However, even to this type of simple architecture, it is also a ``black box''; that is, it remains unclear how to interpret the mechanism of its solutions obtained by the back-propagation algorithm and how to control the training process through a deterministic way. This paper systematically studies the first problem by constructing universal function-approximation solutions. It is shown that, both theoretically and experimentally, the training solution for the one-dimensional input could be completely understood, and that for a higher-dimensional input can also be well interpreted to some extent. Those results pave the way for thoroughly revealing the black box of two-layer ReLU networks and advance the understanding of deep ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Optimization via Subset-Norm and Subspace-Momentum: Fast, Memory-Reduced Training with Convergence Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient adaptive optimization that reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scale neural networks. The first technique, Subset-Norm adaptive step size, generalizes AdaGrad-Norm and AdaGrad(-Coordinate) by reducing the second moment term's memory footprint from $O(d)$ to $O(\sqrt{d})$ through step-size sharing, where $d$ is the model size. For non-convex smooth objectives under coordinate-wise sub-gaussian gradient noise, we prove a noise-adapted high-probability convergence guarantee showing improved dimensional dependence over existing methods. Our second technique, Subspace-Momentum, reduces the momentum state's memory footprint by operating in a low-dimensional subspace while applying standard SGD in the orthogonal complement. We establish high-probability convergence rates under similar relaxed assumptions. Empirical evaluation on LLaMA models from 60M to 1B parameters demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods, where combining subset-norm with subspace-momentum achieves Adam's validation perplexity in approximately half the training tokens (6.8B vs 13.1B) while using only 20% of the Adam's optimizer-states memory footprint and requiring minimal additional hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Delayed Memory Unit: Modelling Temporal Dependency Through Delay Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely recognized for their proficiency in modeling temporal dependencies, making them highly prevalent in sequential data processing applications. Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.</description>

Abstract: A traditional approach to assessing emerging intelligence in the theory of intelligent systems is based on the similarity, "imitation" of human-like actions and behaviors, benchmarking the performance of intelligent systems on the scale of human cognitive skills. In this work we attempt to outline the shortcomings of this line of thought, which is based on the implicit presumption of the equivalence and compatibility of the originating and emergent intelligences. We provide arguments to the point that under some natural assumptions, developing intelligent systems will be able to form their own intents and objectives. Then, the difference in the rate of progress of natural and artificial systems that was noted on multiple occasions in the discourse on artificial intelligence can lead to the scenario of a progressive divergence of the intelligences, in their cognitive abilities, functions and resources, values, ethical frameworks, worldviews, intents and existential objectives: the scenario of the AGI evolutionary gap. We discuss evolutionary processes that can guide the development of emergent intelligent systems and attempt to identify the starting point of the progressive divergence scenario.</description>

Abstract: Previous research in the scientific field has utilized statistical empirical models and machine learning to address fitting challenges. While empirical models have the advantage of numerical generalization, they often sacrifice accuracy. However, conventional machine learning methods can achieve high precision but may lack the desired generalization. The article introduces a Regression-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Reg-PINNs), which embeds physics-inspired empirical models into the neural network's loss function, thereby combining the benefits of generalization and high accuracy. The study validates the proposed method using the magnetopause boundary location as the target and explores the feasibility of methods including Shue et al. [1998], a data overfitting model, a fully-connected networks, Reg-PINNs with Shue's model, and Reg-PINNs with the overfitting model. Compared to Shue's model, this technique achieves approximately a 30% reduction in RMSE, presenting a proof-of-concept improved solution for the scientific community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.</description>

      <title>Positional Encoding Helps Recurrent Neural Networks Handle a Large Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reports an unintuitive finding that positional encoding enhances learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Positional encoding is a high-dimensional representation of time indices on input data. Most famously, positional encoding complements the capabilities of Transformer neural networks, which lack an inherent mechanism for representing the data order. By contrast, RNNs can encode the temporal information of data points on their own, rendering their use of positional encoding seemingly redundant/unnecessary. Nonetheless, investigations through synthetic benchmarks reveal an advantage of coupling positional encoding and RNNs, especially for handling a large vocabulary that yields low-frequency tokens. Further scrutinization unveils that these low-frequency tokens destabilizes the gradients of vanilla RNNs, and the positional encoding resolves this instability. These results shed a new light on the utility of positional encoding beyond its canonical role as a timekeeper for Transformers.</description>

      <title>Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is not theoretically well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these and other results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental challenge of scaling PC to deeper models.</description>

      <title>TX-Gen: Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</description>

      <title>In-Simulation Testing of Deep Learning Vision Models in Autonomous Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing autonomous robotic manipulators is challenging due to the complex software interactions between vision and control components. A crucial element of modern robotic manipulators is the deep learning based object detection model. The creation and assessment of this model requires real world data, which can be hard to label and collect, especially when the hardware setup is not available. The current techniques primarily focus on using synthetic data to train deep neural networks (DDNs) and identifying failures through offline or online simulation-based testing. However, the process of exploiting the identified failures to uncover design flaws early on, and leveraging the optimized DNN within the simulation to accelerate the engineering of the DNN for real-world tasks remains unclear. To address these challenges, we propose the MARTENS (Manipulator Robot Testing and Enhancement in Simulation) framework, which integrates a photorealistic NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulator with evolutionary search to identify critical scenarios aiming at improving the deep learning vision model and uncovering system design flaws. Evaluation of two industrial case studies demonstrated that MARTENS effectively reveals robotic manipulator system failures, detecting 25 % to 50 % more failures with greater diversity compared to random test generation. The model trained and repaired using the MARTENS approach achieved mean average precision (mAP) scores of 0.91 and 0.82 on real-world images with no prior retraining. Further fine-tuning on real-world images for a few epochs (less than 10) increased the mAP to 0.95 and 0.89 for the first and second use cases, respectively. In contrast, a model trained solely on real-world data achieved mAPs of 0.8 and 0.75 for use case 1 and use case 2 after more than 25 epochs.</description>
