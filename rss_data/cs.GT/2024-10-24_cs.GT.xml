      <title>RediSwap: MEV Redistribution Mechanism for CFMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to decentralized finance, offering continuous liquidity and enabling intermediary-free trading on blockchains. However, participants in AMMs are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation. Users face threats such as front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks, while liquidity providers (LPs) incur the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR).
  In this paper, we introduce RediSwap, a novel AMM designed to capture MEV at the application level and refund it fairly among users and liquidity providers. At its core, RediSwap features an MEV-redistribution mechanism that manages arbitrage opportunities within the AMM pool. We formalize the mechanism design problem and the desired game-theoretical properties. A central insight underpinning our mechanism is the interpretation of the maximal MEV value as the sum of LVR and individual user losses. We prove that our mechanism is incentive-compatible and Sybil-proof, and demonstrate that it is easy for arbitrageurs to participate.
  We empirically compared RediSwap with existing solutions by replaying historical AMM trades. Our results suggest that RediSwap can achieve better execution than UniswapX in 89% of trades and reduce LPs' loss to under 0.5% of the original LVR in most cases.</description>

      <title>Incentives for Early Arrival in Cost Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cooperative games, we study how values created or costs incurred by a coalition are shared among the members within it, and the players may join the coalition in a online manner such as investors invest a startup. Recently, Ge et al. [10] proposed a new property called incentives for early arrival (I4EA) in such games, which says that the online allocation of values or costs should incentivize agents to join early in order to prevent mutual strategic waiting. Ideally, the allocation should also be fair, so that agents arriving in an order uniformly at random should expect to get/pay their Shapley values. Ge et al. [10] showed that not all monotone value functions admit such mechanisms in online value sharing games. In this work, we show a sharp contrast in online cost sharing games. We construct a mechanism with all the properties mentioned above, for every monotone cost function. To achieve this, we first solve 0-1 valued cost sharing games with a novel mechanism called Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanism (SFS-CS), and then extend SFS-CS to a family called generalized Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanisms (GSFS-CS). The critical technique we invented here is a mapping from one arrival order to another order so that we can directly apply marginal cost allocation on the shuffled orders to satisfy the properties. Finally, we solve general valued cost functions, by decomposing them into 0-1 valued functions in an online fashion.</description>

      <title>Fair Diffusion Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion auction design is a new trend in mechanism design which extended the original incentive compatibility property to include buyers' private connection report. Reporting connections is equivalent to inviting their neighbors to join the auction in practice. The social welfare of a diffusion auction is collectively accumulated by all participants: reporting high valuations or inviting high-valuation neighbors. Because of this, we can measure each participant's contribution by the marginal social welfare increase due to her participation.
  Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new property called \textit{Shapley fairness} to capture their social welfare contribution and to use it as a benchmark to guide our auction design for a fairer utility allocation. Not surprisingly, none of the existing diffusion auctions has ever approximated the fairness, because Shapley fairness depends on each buyer's own valuation and this dependence can easily violate incentive compatibility. Thus, we combat this challenge by proposing a new diffusion auction called \textit{Permutation Diffusion Auction} (PDA) for selling $k$ homogeneous items, which is the first diffusion auction satisfying $\frac{1}{k+1}$-Shapley fairness, incentive compatibility and individual rationality. Furthermore, PDA can be extended to the general combinatorial auction setting where the literature did not discover meaningful diffusion auctions yet.</description>

      <title>Approximate EFX and Exact tEFX Allocations for Indivisible Chores: Improved Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fair distribution of a set of $m$ indivisible chores among $n$ agents, where each agent's costs are evaluated using a monotone cost function. Our focus lies on two fairness criteria: envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) and a relaxed notion, namely envy-freeness up to the transfer of any item (tEFX). We demonstrate that a 2-approximate EFX allocation exists and is computable in polynomial time for three agents with subadditive cost functions, improving upon the previous $(2 + \sqrt{6})$ approximation for additive cost functions. This result requires extensive case analysis. Christoforidis et al. (IJCAI'24) independently claim the same approximation for additive cost functions; however, we provide a counter-example to their algorithm. We expand the number of agents to any number to get the same approximation guarantee with the assumption of partially identical ordering (IDO) for the cost functions. Additionally, we establish that a tEFX allocation is achievable for three agents if one has an additive 2-ratio bounded cost function, while the others may have general monotone cost functions. This is an improvement from the prior requirement of two agents with additive 2-ratio bounded cost functions. This allocation can also be extended to agent groups with identical valuations. Further, we show various analyses of EFX allocations for chores, such as the relaxations for additive $\alpha$-ratio-bounded cost functions.</description>

      <title>Learning Collusion in Episodic, Inventory-Constrained Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing algorithms have demonstrated the capability to learn tacit collusion that is largely unaddressed by current regulations. Their increasing use in markets, including oligopolistic industries with a history of collusion, calls for closer examination by competition authorities. In this paper, we extend the study of tacit collusion in learning algorithms from basic pricing games to more complex markets characterized by perishable goods with fixed supply and sell-by dates, such as airline tickets, perishables, and hotel rooms. We formalize collusion within this framework and introduce a metric based on price levels under both the competitive (Nash) equilibrium and collusive (monopolistic) optimum. Since no analytical expressions for these price levels exist, we propose an efficient computational approach to derive them. Through experiments, we demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning agents can learn to collude in this more complex domain. Additionally, we analyze the underlying mechanisms and structures of the collusive strategies these agents adopt.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic collusion in a two-sided market: A rideshare example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With dynamic pricing on the rise, firms are using sophisticated algorithms for price determination. These algorithms are often non-interpretable and there has been a recent interest in their seemingly emergent ability to tacitly collude with each other without any prior communication whatsoever. Most of the previous works investigate algorithmic collusion on simple reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithms operating on a basic market model. Instead, we explore the collusive tendencies of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art continuous state/action space RL algorithm, on a complex double-sided hierarchical market model of rideshare. For this purpose, we extend a mathematical program network (MPN) based rideshare model to a temporal multi origin-destination setting and use PPO to solve for a repeated duopoly game. Our results indicate that PPO can either converge to a competitive or a collusive equilibrium depending upon the underlying market characteristics, even when the hyper-parameters are held constant.</description>

      <title>Best-of-Both-Worlds Fair Allocation of Indivisible and Mixed Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating either a set of indivisible goods or a set of mixed divisible and indivisible goods (i.e., mixed goods) to agents with additive utilities, taking the best-of-both-worlds perspective of guaranteeing fairness properties both ex ante and ex post. The ex-post fairness notions considered in this paper are relaxations of envy-freeness, specifically, EFX for indivisible-goods allocation, and EFM for mixed-goods allocation. For two agents, we show that there is a polynomial-time randomized algorithm that achieves ex-ante envy-freeness and ex-post EFX / EFM simultaneously. For $n$ agents with bi-valued utilities, we show there exist randomized allocations that are (i) ex-ante proportional and ex-post EFM, and (ii) ex-ante envy-free, ex-post EFX, and ex-post fractionally Pareto optimal.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware Compensation Design for Sustainable Data Rights in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern distributed learning systems face a critical challenge when clients request the removal of their data influence from trained models, as this process can significantly destabilize system performance and affect remaining participants. We propose an innovative mechanism that views this challenge through the lens of game theory, establishing a leader-follower framework where a central coordinator provides strategic incentives to maintain system stability during data removal operations. Our approach quantifies the ripple effects of data removal through a comprehensive analytical model that captures both system-wide and participant-specific impacts. We establish mathematical foundations for measuring participant utility and system outcomes, revealing critical insights into how data diversity influences both individual decisions and overall system stability. The framework incorporates a computationally efficient solution method that addresses the inherent complexity of optimizing participant interactions and resource allocation.</description>
