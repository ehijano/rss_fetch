      <title>Safe and Efficient Social Navigation through Explainable Safety Regions Based on Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics has driven the development of algorithms that enable autonomous systems to adapt to complex social environments. In particular, safe and efficient social navigation is a key challenge, requiring AI not only to avoid collisions and deadlocks but also to interact intuitively and predictably with its surroundings. To date, methods based on probabilistic models and the generation of conformal safety regions have shown promising results in defining safety regions with a controlled margin of error, primarily relying on classification approaches and explicit rules to describe collision-free navigation conditions.
  This work explores how topological features contribute to explainable safety regions in social navigation. Instead of using behavioral parameters, we leverage topological data analysis to classify and characterize different simulation behaviors. First, we apply global rule-based classification to distinguish between safe (collision-free) and unsafe scenarios based on topological properties. Then, we define safety regions, $S_\varepsilon$, in the topological feature space, ensuring a maximum classification error of $\varepsilon$. These regions are built with adjustable SVM classifiers and order statistics, providing robust decision boundaries. Local rules extracted from these regions enhance interpretability, keeping the decision-making process transparent.
  Our approach initially separates simulations with and without collisions, outperforming methods that not incorporate topological features. It offers a deeper understanding of robot interactions within a navigable space. We further refine safety regions to ensure deadlock-free simulations and integrate both aspects to define a compliant simulation space that guarantees safe and efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>CoIn-SafeLink: Safety-critical Control With Cost-sensitive Incremental Random Vector Functional Link Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) play a crucial role in achieving the safety-critical control of robotic systems theoretically. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which is often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. In this paper, a novel CBF construction approach, called CoIn-SafeLink, is proposed based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing an appropriate cost function, CoIn-SafeLink achieves differentiated sensitivities to safe and unsafe samples, effectively achieving zero false-negative risk in unsafe sample classification. Additionally, an incremental update theorem for CoIn-SafeLink is proposed, enabling precise adjustments in response to changes in the unsafe region. Finally, the gradient analytical expression of the CoIn-SafeLink is provided to calculate the control input. The proposed method is validated on a 3-degree-of-freedom drone attitude control system. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can effectively learn the unsafe region boundaries and rapidly adapt as these regions evolve, with an update speed approximately five times faster than comparison methods.

      <title>A Vehicle-Infrastructure Multi-layer Cooperative Decision-making Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has entered the testing phase, but due to the limited decision-making capabilities of individual vehicle algorithms, safety and efficiency issues have become more apparent in complex scenarios. With the advancement of connected communication technologies, autonomous vehicles equipped with connectivity can leverage vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, offering a potential solution to the decision-making challenges from individual vehicle's perspective. We propose a multi-level vehicle-infrastructure cooperative decision-making framework for complex conflict scenarios at unsignalized intersections. First, based on vehicle states, we define a method for quantifying vehicle impacts and their propagation relationships, using accumulated impact to group vehicles through motif-based graph clustering. Next, within and between vehicle groups, a pass order negotiation process based on Large Language Models (LLM) is employed to determine the vehicle passage order, resulting in planned vehicle actions. Simulation results from ablation experiments show that our approach reduces negotiation complexity and ensures safer, more efficient vehicle passage at intersections, aligning with natural decision-making logic.</description>

      <title>Design of Reward Function on Reinforcement Learning for Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a design scheme of reward function that constantly evaluates both driving states and actions for applying reinforcement learning to automated driving. In the field of reinforcement learning, reward functions often evaluate whether the goal is achieved by assigning values such as +1 for success and -1 for failure. This type of reward function can potentially obtain a policy that achieves the goal, but the process by which the goal is reached is not evaluated. However, process to reach a destination is important for automated driving, such as keeping velocity, avoiding risk, retaining distance from other cars, keeping comfortable for passengers. Therefore, the reward function designed by the proposed scheme is suited for automated driving by evaluating driving process. The effects of the proposed scheme are demonstrated on simulated circuit driving and highway cruising. Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic is used, and models are trained under some situations for generalization. The result shows that appropriate driving positions are obtained, such as traveling on the inside of corners, and rapid deceleration to turn along sharp curves. In highway cruising, the ego vehicle becomes able to change lane in an environment where there are other vehicles with suitable deceleration to avoid catching up to a front vehicle, and acceleration so that a rear vehicle does not catch up to the ego vehicle.</description>

      <title>AUV Acceleration Prediction Using DVL and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are essential for various applications, including oceanographic surveys, underwater mapping, and infrastructure inspections. Accurate and robust navigation are critical to completing these tasks. To this end, a Doppler velocity log (DVL) and inertial sensors are fused together. Recently, a model-based approach demonstrated the ability to extract the vehicle acceleration vector from DVL velocity measurements. Motivated by this advancement, in this paper we present an end-to-end deep learning approach to estimate the AUV acceleration vector based on past DVL velocity measurements. Based on recorded data from sea experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves acceleration vector estimation by more than 65% compared to the model-based approach by using data-driven techniques. As a result of our data-driven approach, we can enhance navigation accuracy and reliability in AUV applications, contributing to more efficient and effective underwater missions through improved accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>ContactFusion: Stochastic Poisson Surface Maps from Visual and Contact Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and precise robotic assembly entails insertion of constituent components. Insertion success is hindered when noise in scene understanding exceeds tolerance limits, especially when fabricated with tight tolerances. In this work, we propose ContactFusion which combines global mapping with local contact information, fusing point clouds with force sensing. Our method entails a Rejection Sampling based contact occupancy sensing procedure which estimates contact locations on the end-effector from Force/Torque sensing at the wrist. We demonstrate how to fuse contact with visual information into a Stochastic Poisson Surface Map (SPSMap) - a map representation that can be updated with the Stochastic Poisson Surface Reconstruction (SPSR) algorithm. We first validate the contact occupancy sensor in simulation and show its ability to detect the contact location on the robot from force sensing information. Then, we evaluate our method in a peg-in-hole task, demonstrating an improvement in the hole pose estimate with the fusion of the contact information with the SPSMap.</description>

      <title>Informative Path Planning to Explore and Map Unknown Planetary Surfaces with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many environments, such as unvisited planetary surfaces and oceanic regions, remain unexplored due to a lack of prior knowledge. Autonomous vehicles must sample upon arrival, process data, and either transmit findings to a teleoperator or decide where to explore next. Teleoperation is suboptimal, as human intuition lacks mathematical guarantees for optimality. This study evaluates an informative path planning algorithm for mapping a scalar variable distribution while minimizing travel distance and ensuring model convergence. We compare traditional open loop coverage methods (e.g., Boustrophedon, Spiral) with information-theoretic approaches using Gaussian processes, which update models iteratively with confidence metrics. The algorithm's performance is tested on three surfaces, a parabola, Townsend function, and lunar crater hydration map, to assess noise, convexity, and function behavior. Results demonstrate that information-driven methods significantly outperform naive exploration in reducing model error and travel distance while improving convergence potential.</description>

      <title>A Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping-based Framework for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Autonomous Robot Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable acceleration of robotic development through advanced simulation technology, robotic applications are often subject to performance reductions in real-world deployment due to the inherent discrepancy between simulation and reality, often referred to as the "sim-to-real gap". This gap arises from factors like model inaccuracies, environmental variations, and unexpected disturbances. Similarly, model discrepancies caused by system degradation over time or minor changes in the system's configuration also hinder the effectiveness of the developed methodologies. Effectively closing these gaps is critical and remains an open challenge. This work proposes a lightweight conformal mapping framework to transfer control and planning policies from an expert teacher to a degraded less capable learner. The method leverages Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (SCM) to geometrically map teacher control inputs into the learner's command space, ensuring maneuver consistency. To demonstrate its generality, the framework is applied to two representative types of control and planning methods in a path-tracking task: 1) a discretized motion primitives command transfer and 2) a continuous Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based command transfer. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the sim-to-real gap by closely transferring teacher commands to the learner robot.</description>

      <title>Depth Matters: Multimodal RGB-D Perception for Robust Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that rely purely on perception to make real-time control decisions require efficient and robust architectures. In this work, we demonstrate that augmenting RGB input with depth information significantly enhances our agents' ability to predict steering commands compared to using RGB alone. We benchmark lightweight recurrent controllers that leverage the fused RGB-D features for sequential decision-making. To train our models, we collect high-quality data using a small-scale autonomous car controlled by an expert driver via a physical steering wheel, capturing varying levels of steering difficulty. Our models, trained under diverse configurations, were successfully deployed on real hardware. Specifically, our findings reveal that the early fusion of depth data results in a highly robust controller, which remains effective even with frame drops and increased noise levels, without compromising the network's focus on the task.</description>

      <title>Ground and Flight Locomotion for Two-Wheeled Drones via Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning for two-wheeled drones that can drive on the ground and fly in the air. Conventional methods for two-wheeled drone motion planning typically rely on gradient-based optimization and assume that obstacle shapes can be approximated by a differentiable form. To overcome this limitation, we propose a motion planning method based on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, enabling navigation through arbitrarily shaped obstacles by switching between driving and flight modes. To handle the instability and rapid solution changes caused by mode switching, our proposed method switches the control space and utilizes the auxiliary controller for MPPI. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enables navigation in unstructured environments and achieves effective obstacle avoidance through mode switching.</description>

Abstract: The displacement-actuated continuum robot as an abstraction has been shown as a key abstraction to significantly simplify and improve approaches due to its relation to the Clarke transform. To highlight further potentials, we revisit and extend this abstraction that features an increasingly popular length extension and an underutilized twisting. For each extension, the corresponding mapping from the joint values to the local coordinates of the manifold embedded in the joint spaces is provided. Each mapping is characterized by its compactness and linearity.</description>

      <title>BEAC: Imitating Complex Exploration and Task-oriented Behaviors for Invisible Object Nonprehensile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying imitation learning (IL) is challenging to nonprehensile manipulation tasks of invisible objects with partial observations, such as excavating buried rocks. The demonstrator must make such complex action decisions as exploring to find the object and task-oriented actions to complete the task while estimating its hidden state, perhaps causing inconsistent action demonstration and high cognitive load problems. For these problems, work in human cognitive science suggests that promoting the use of pre-designed, simple exploration rules for the demonstrator may alleviate the problems of action inconsistency and high cognitive load. Therefore, when performing imitation learning from demonstrations using such exploration rules, it is important to accurately imitate not only the demonstrator's task-oriented behavior but also his/her mode-switching behavior (exploratory or task-oriented behavior) under partial observation. Based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a novel imitation learning framework called Belief Exploration-Action Cloning (BEAC), which has a switching policy structure between a pre-designed exploration policy and a task-oriented action policy trained on the estimated belief states based on past history. In simulation and real robot experiments, we confirmed that our proposed method achieved the best task performance, higher mode and action prediction accuracies, while reducing the cognitive load in the demonstration indicated by a user study.</description>

      <title>DyWA: Dynamics-adaptive World Action Model for Generalizable Non-prehensile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation is crucial for handling objects that are too thin, large, or otherwise ungraspable in unstructured environments. While conventional planning-based approaches struggle with complex contact modeling, learning-based methods have recently emerged as a promising alternative. However, existing learning-based approaches face two major limitations: they heavily rely on multi-view cameras and precise pose tracking, and they fail to generalize across varying physical conditions, such as changes in object mass and table friction. To address these challenges, we propose the Dynamics-Adaptive World Action Model (DyWA), a novel framework that enhances action learning by jointly predicting future states while adapting to dynamics variations based on historical trajectories. By unifying the modeling of geometry, state, physics, and robot actions, DyWA enables more robust policy learning under partial observability. Compared to baselines, our method improves the success rate by 31.5% using only single-view point cloud observations in the simulation. Furthermore, DyWA achieves an average success rate of 68% in real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse object geometries, adapt to varying table friction, and robustness in challenging scenarios such as half-filled water bottles and slippery surfaces.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Human Locomotion Analysis in Lower-Limb Exoskeletons: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable robotics for lower-limb assistance have become a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance mobility for individuals with physical impairments or augment the performance of able-bodied users. Accurate and adaptive control systems are essential to ensure seamless interaction between the wearer and the robotic device, particularly when navigating diverse and dynamic terrains. Despite the recent advances in neural networks for time series analysis, no attempts have been directed towards the classification of ground conditions, categorized into five classes and subsequently determining the ramp's slope and stair's height. In this respect, this paper presents an experimental comparison between eight deep neural network backbones to predict high-level locomotion parameters across diverse terrains.
  All the models are trained on the publicly available CAMARGO 2021 dataset. IMU-only data equally or outperformed IMU+EMG inputs, promoting a cost-effective and efficient design. Indeeds, using three IMU sensors, the LSTM achieved high terrain classification accuracy (0.94 +- 0.04) and precise ramp slope (1.95 +- 0.58{\deg}) and the CNN-LSTM a stair height (15.65 +- 7.40 mm) estimations. As a further contribution, SHAP analysis justified sensor reduction without performance loss, ensuring a lightweight setup. The system operates with ~2 ms inference time, supporting real-time applications. The code is code available at https://github.com/cosbidev/Human-Locomotion-Identification.</description>

Extant research has primarily sought to understand social interactions and expectations in personal rather than professional settings, and none of these studies have examined negative outcomes arising from violations of social expectations. This paper reports the results of a 2x3 online experiment that used a unique first-person perspective video to immerse participants in a collaborative workplace setting. The results are nuanced and reveal that while robots are expected to act in accordance with social expectations despite human behavior, there are benefits for robots perceived as being the bigger person in the face of human rudeness. Theoretical and practical implications are provided which discuss the import of these findings for the design of social robots.</description>

      <title>Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control for the Interception of Dynamic Targets under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercepting dynamic objects in uncertain environments involves a significant unresolved challenge in modern robotic systems. Current control approaches rely solely on estimated information, and results lack guarantees of robustness and feasibility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to tackle the interception of targets whose motion is affected by known and bounded uncertainty. Our approach introduces new techniques of reachability analysis for rigid bodies, leveraged to guarantee feasibility of interception under uncertain conditions. We then propose a Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control Problem, ensuring robustness and guaranteed reachability to a target set of configurations. We demonstrate the methodology in the case study of an interception maneuver of a tumbling target in space.</description>

      <title>Targetless 6DoF Calibration of LiDAR and 2D Scanning Radar Based on Cylindrical Occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the capability for reliable and all-weather long-range sensing, the fusion of LiDAR and Radar has been widely applied to autonomous vehicles for robust perception. In practical operation, well manually calibrated extrinsic parameters, which are crucial for the fusion of multi-modal sensors, may drift due to the vibration. To address this issue, we present a novel targetless calibration approach, termed LiRaCo, for the extrinsic 6DoF calibration of LiDAR and Radar sensors. Although both types of sensors can obtain geometric information, bridging the geometric correspondences between multi-modal data without any clues of explicit artificial markers is nontrivial, mainly due to the low vertical resolution of scanning Radar. To achieve the targetless calibration, LiRaCo leverages a spatial occupancy consistency between LiDAR point clouds and Radar scans in a common cylindrical representation, considering the increasing data sparsity with distance for both sensors. Specifically, LiRaCo expands the valid Radar scanned pixels into 3D occupancy grids to constrain LiDAR point clouds based on spatial consistency. Consequently, a cost function involving extrinsic calibration parameters is formulated based on the spatial overlap of 3D grids and LiDAR points. Extrinsic parameters are finally estimated by optimizing the cost function. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two real outdoor datasets with different LiDAR sensors demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Conflict Avoidance Between Humans and Quadruped Robots in Shared Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, robots are increasingly operated in environments shared with humans, where conflicts between human and robot behaviors may compromise safety. This paper presents a proactive behavioral conflict avoidance framework based on the principle of adaptation to trends for quadruped robots that not only ensures the robot's safety but also minimizes interference with human activities. It can proactively avoid potential conflicts with approaching humans or other dynamic objects, whether the robot is stationary or in motion, then swiftly resume its tasks once the conflict subsides. An enhanced approach is proposed to achieve precise human detection and tracking on vibratory robot platform equipped with low-cost hybrid solid-state LiDAR. When potential conflict detected, the robot selects an avoidance point and executes an evasion maneuver before resuming its task. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that remain goal-driven, often resulting in aggressive behaviors, such as forcibly bypassing obstacles and causing conflicts or becoming stuck in deadlock scenarios. The selection of avoidance points is achieved by integrating static and dynamic obstacle to generate a potential field map. The robot then searches for feasible regions within this map and determines the optimal avoidance point using an evaluation function. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces interference with human activities, enhances the safety of both robots and persons.</description>

      <title>HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</description>

      <title>Exploring psychophysiological methods for human-robot collaboration in construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychophysiological methods present a promising approach to fostering enhanced mutual communication and collaboration between human workers and robots. Despite their potential, there is still limited understanding of how to effectively integrate psychophysiological methods to improve human-robot collaboration (HRC) in construction. This paper addresses this gap by critically reviewing the use of psychophysiological methods for HRC within construction environments, employing a concept-methodology-value philosophical framework. The analysis reveals that measuring brain activity using electroencephalography is the most widely used method, while most of the works are still at the proof of concept stage and lack empirical evidence. Three potential research directions were proposed: the integration of multi-modal psychophysiological signals, enriching the existing experimental settings for better generalizability, and leveraging advanced biocompatible or contactless technologies for effective signal detection. The findings should benefit subsequent exploration and practical applications of psychophysiological methods to enable better implementation of robots and support HRC in construction.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

      <title>Control the Soft Robot Arm with its Physical Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exploit the compliant capabilities of soft robot arms we require controller which can exploit their physical capabilities. Teleoperation, leveraging a human in the loop, is a key step towards achieving more complex control strategies. Whilst teleoperation is widely used for rigid robots, for soft robots we require teleoperation methods where the configuration of the whole body is considered. We propose a method of using an identical 'physical twin', or demonstrator of the robot. This tendon robot can be back-driven, with the tendon lengths providing configuration perception, and enabling a direct mapping of tendon lengths for the execture. We demonstrate how this teleoperation across the entire configuration of the robot enables complex interactions with exploit the envrionment, such as squeezing into gaps. We also show how this method can generalize to robots which are a larger scale that the physical twin, and how, tuneability of the stiffness properties of the physical twin simplify its use.</description>

      <title>LLM+MAP: Bimanual Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models and Planning Domain Definition Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation provides significant versatility, but also presents an inherent challenge due to the complexity involved in the spatial and temporal coordination between two hands. Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By analyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and planning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

      <title>Enhancing Human-Robot Collaboration through Existing Guidelines: A Case Study Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become more prevalent, concerns about their development, operation, and societal impact intensify. Establishing ethical, social, and safety standards amidst evolving AI capabilities poses significant challenges. Global initiatives are underway to establish guidelines for AI system development and operation. With the increasing use of collaborative human-AI task execution, it's vital to continuously adapt AI systems to meet user and environmental needs. Failure to synchronize AI evolution with changes in users and the environment could result in ethical and safety issues. This paper evaluates the applicability of existing guidelines in human-robot collaborative systems, assesses their effectiveness, and discusses limitations. Through a case study, we examine whether our target system meets requirements outlined in existing guidelines and propose improvements to enhance human-robot interactions. Our contributions provide insights into interpreting and applying guidelines, offer concrete examples of system enhancement, and highlight their applicability and limitations. We believe these contributions will stimulate discussions and influence system assurance and certification in future AI-infused critical systems.</description>

      <title>SHIFT: An Interdisciplinary Framework for Scaffolding Human Attention and Understanding in Explanatory Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a domain-independent approach for adaptive scaffolding in robotic explanation generation to guide tasks in human-robot interaction. We present a method for incorporating interdisciplinary research results into a computational model as a pre-configured scoring system implemented in a framework called SHIFT. This involves outlining a procedure for integrating concepts from disciplines outside traditional computer science into a robotics computational framework. Our approach allows us to model the human cognitive state into six observable states within the human partner model. To study the pre-configuration of the system, we implement a reinforcement learning approach on top of our model. This approach allows adaptation to individuals who deviate from the configuration of the scoring system. Therefore, in our proof-of-concept evaluation, the model's adaptability on four different user types shows that the models' adaptation performs better, i.e., recouped faster after exploration and has a higher accumulated reward with our pre-configured scoring system than without it. We discuss further strategies of speeding up the learning phase to enable a realistic adaptation behavior to real users. The system is accessible through docker and supports querying via ROS.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Uncanny Valley Effect in Hyper-Realistic Robots: A Student-Centered Study on LLM-Driven Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncanny valley effect poses a significant challenge in the development and acceptance of hyper-realistic social robots. This study investigates whether advanced conversational capabilities powered by large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this effect in highly anthropomorphic robots. We conducted a user study with 80 participants interacting with Nadine, a hyper-realistic humanoid robot equipped with LLM-driven communication skills. Through pre- and post-interaction surveys, we assessed changes in perceptions of uncanniness, conversational quality, and overall user experience. Our findings reveal that LLM-enhanced interactions significantly reduce feelings of eeriness while fostering more natural and engaging conversations. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing user acceptance, including conversational naturalness, human-likeness, and interestingness. Based on these insights, we propose design recommendations to enhance the appeal and acceptability of hyper-realistic robots in social contexts. This research contributes to the growing field of human-robot interaction by offering empirical evidence on the potential of LLMs to bridge the uncanny valley, with implications for the future development of social robots.</description>

      <title>Do Looks Matter? Exploring Functional and Aesthetic Design Preferences for a Robotic Guide Dog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dog guides offer an effective mobility solution for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, but conventional dog guides have limitations including the need for care, potential distractions, societal prejudice, high costs, and limited availability. To address these challenges, we seek to develop a robot dog guide capable of performing the tasks of a conventional dog guide, enhanced with additional features. In this work, we focus on design research to identify functional and aesthetic design concepts to implement into a quadrupedal robot. The aesthetic design remains relevant even for BVI users due to their sensitivity toward societal perceptions and the need for smooth integration into society. We collected data through interviews and surveys to answer specific design questions pertaining to the appearance, texture, features, and method of controlling and communicating with the robot. Our study identified essential and preferred features for a future robot dog guide, which are supported by relevant statistics aligning with each suggestion. These findings will inform the future development of user-centered designs to effectively meet the needs of BVI individuals.</description>

      <title>Think-Then-React: Towards Unconstrained Human Action-to-Reaction Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling human-like action-to-reaction generation has significant real-world applications, like human-robot interaction and games. Despite recent advancements in single-person motion generation, it is still challenging to well handle action-to-reaction generation, due to the difficulty of directly predicting reaction from action sequence without prompts, and the absence of a unified representation that effectively encodes multi-person motion. To address these challenges, we introduce Think-Then-React (TTR), a large language-model-based framework designed to generate human-like reactions. First, with our fine-grained multimodal training strategy, TTR is capable to unify two processes during inference: a thinking process that explicitly infers action intentions and reasons corresponding reaction description, which serve as semantic prompts, and a reacting process that predicts reactions based on input action and the inferred semantic prompts. Second, to effectively represent multi-person motion in language models, we propose a unified motion tokenizer by decoupling egocentric pose and absolute space features, which effectively represents action and reaction motion with same encoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TTR outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements in evaluation metrics, such as reducing FID from 3.988 to 1.942.</description>

      <title>The Realization of Virtual Environments in the Lower Limb Exoskeletal Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes the realization of various virtual environments using a lower limb exoskeletal robot for futuristic gait rehabilitation. The proposed method allows the user to feel virtual gravity, buoyancy, and drag while actively walking. The virtual environments include four fluidic conditions: Water, Olive oil, Honey, and Peanut Butter, and four gravitational conditions consisting of the Earth's, Moon's, Mars', and Jupiter's gravity. The control method of the lower limb exoskeletal robot is as follows. First, torque feedback is applied to control the interaction force between the exoskeletal robot and its user. Second, the reference torque is computed in real time with the dynamic equations of the human body and the kinematic data. The eight environments were implemented via the EXOWheel, a wheelchair-integrated lower limb exoskeletal robot. While attaching electromyography sensors and wearing the EXOWheel, eight healthy subjects walked actively under the virtual conditions. Experimental results show that muscular force signals adequately change depending on gravitational, buoyant, and drag effects. Blind tests confirmed that subjects could reliably distinguish all eight virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Explainability with Multimodal Context Representations for Smarter Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced in recent years, driving innovation across various fields, especially in robotics. Even though robots can perform complex tasks with increasing autonomy, challenges remain in ensuring explainability and user-centered design for effective interaction. A key issue in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is enabling robots to effectively perceive and reason over multimodal inputs, such as audio and vision, to foster trust and seamless collaboration. In this paper, we propose a generalized and explainable multimodal framework for context representation, designed to improve the fusion of speech and vision modalities. We introduce a use case on assessing 'Relevance' between verbal utterances from the user and visual scene perception of the robot. We present our methodology with a Multimodal Joint Representation module and a Temporal Alignment module, which can allow robots to evaluate relevance by temporally aligning multimodal inputs. Finally, we discuss how the proposed framework for context representation can help with various aspects of explainability in HRI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction in Healthcare: A Study on Nonverbal Communication Cues and Trust Dynamics with NAO Robot Caregivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the population of older adults increases, so will the need for both human and robot care providers. While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions. Despite limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of humanoid robots to improve health monitoring and caregiving for older adults.</description>

      <title>PERCY: Personal Emotional Robotic Conversational System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional rule-based conversational robots, constrained by predefined scripts and static response mappings, fundamentally lack adaptability for personalized, long-term human interaction. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized conversational AI through open-domain capabilities, current social robots implementing LLMs still lack emotional awareness and continuous personalization. This dual limitation hinders their ability to sustain engagement across multiple interaction sessions. We bridge this gap with PERCY (Personal Emotional Robotic Conversational sYstem), a system designed to enable open-domain, multi-turn dialogues by dynamically analyzing users' real-time facial expressions and vocabulary to tailor responses based on their emotional state. Built on a ROS-based multimodal framework, PERCY integrates a fine-tuned GPT-4 reasoning engine, combining textual sentiment analysis with visual emotional cues to accurately assess and respond to user emotions. We evaluated PERCY's performance through various dialogue quality metrics, showing strong coherence, relevance, and diversity. Human evaluations revealed PERCY's superior personalization and comparable naturalness to other models. This work highlights the potential for integrating advanced multimodal perception and personalization in social robot dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Glasses: GenAI-driven Glasses with Haptic Feedback for Navigation of Visually Impaired People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LLM-Glasses, a wearable navigation system designed to assist visually impaired individuals by combining haptic feedback, YOLO-World object detection, and GPT-4o-driven reasoning. The system delivers real-time tactile guidance via temple-mounted actuators, enabling intuitive and independent navigation. Three user studies were conducted to evaluate its effectiveness: (1) a haptic pattern recognition study achieving an 81.3% average recognition rate across 13 distinct patterns, (2) a VICON-based navigation study in which participants successfully followed predefined paths in open spaces, and (3) an LLM-guided video evaluation demonstrating 91.8% accuracy in open scenarios, 84.6% with static obstacles, and 81.5% with dynamic obstacles. These results demonstrate the system's reliability in controlled environments, with ongoing work focusing on refining its responsiveness and adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios. LLM-Glasses showcases the potential of combining generative AI with haptic interfaces to empower visually impaired individuals with intuitive and effective mobility solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of conflict situations for autonomous driving research is crucial for understanding and managing interactions between Automated Vehicles (AVs) and human drivers. This paper presents a set of exemplary conflict scenarios in CARLA that arise in shared autonomy settings, where both AVs and human drivers must navigate complex traffic environments. We explore various conflict situations, focusing on the impact of driver behavior and decision-making processes on overall traffic safety and efficiency. We build a simple extendable toolkit for situation awareness research, in which the implemented conflicts can be demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Testing of Foreseeable Misuse by the Driver applicable for Highly Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With Highly Automated Driving (HAD), the driver can engage in non-driving-related tasks. In the event of a system failure, the driver is expected to reasonably regain control of the Automated Vehicle (AV). Incorrect system understanding may provoke misuse by the driver and can lead to vehicle-level hazards. ISO 21448, referred to as the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), defines misuse as usage of the system by the driver in a way not intended by the system manufacturer. Foreseeable Misuse (FM) implies anticipated system misuse based on the best knowledge about the system design and the driver behaviour. This is the underlying motivation to propose simulation-based testing of FM. The vital challenge is to perform a simulation-based testing for a SOTIF-related misuse scenario. Transverse Guidance Assist System (TGAS) is modelled for HAD. In the context of this publication, TGAS is referred to as the "system," and the driver is the human operator of the system. This publication focuses on implementing the Driver-Vehicle Interface (DVI) that permits the interactions between the driver and the system. The implementation and testing of a derived misuse scenario using the driving simulator ensure reasonable usage of the system by supporting the driver with unambiguous information on system functions and states so that the driver can conveniently perceive, comprehend, and act upon the information.</description>

      <title>Pedestrians and Robots: A Novel Dataset for Learning Distinct Social Navigation Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of robots in human-centric public spaces such as shopping malls, sidewalks, and hospitals, requires understanding of how pedestrians respond to their presence. However, existing research lacks comprehensive datasets that capture the full range of pedestrian behaviors, e.g., including avoidance, neutrality, and attraction in the presence of robots. Such datasets can be used to effectively learn models capable of accurately predicting diverse responses of pedestrians to robot presence, which are crucial for advancing robot navigation strategies and optimizing pedestrian-aware motion planning. In this paper, we address these challenges by collecting a novel dataset of pedestrian motion in two outdoor locations under three distinct conditions, i.e., no robot presence, a stationary robot, and a moving robot. Thus, unlike existing datasets, ours explicitly encapsulates variations in pedestrian behavior across the different robot conditions. Using our dataset, we propose a novel Neural Social Robot Force Model (NSRFM), an extension of the traditional Social Force Model that integrates neural networks and robot-induced forces to better predict pedestrian behavior in the presence of robots. We validate the NSRFM by comparing its generated trajectories on different real-world datasets. Furthermore, we implemented it in simulation to enable the learning and benchmarking of robot navigation strategies based on their impact on pedestrian movement. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in replicating real-world pedestrian reactions and its its utility in developing, evaluating, and benchmarking social robot navigation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Inclusive STEAM Education: A Framework for Teaching Cod-2 ing and Robotics to Students with Visually Impairment Using 3 Advanced Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STEAM education integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics to foster creativity and problem-solving. However, students with visual impairments (VI) encounter significant challenges in programming and robotics, particularly in tracking robot movements and developing spatial awareness. This paper presents a framework that leverages pre-constructed robots and algorithms, such as maze-solving techniques, within an accessible learning environment. The proposed system employs Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to process global camera-captured maze layouts, converting visual data into textual descriptions that generate spatial audio prompts in an Audio Virtual Reality (AVR) system. Students issue verbal commands, which are refined through CLIP, while robot-mounted stereo cameras provide real-time data processed via Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for continuous feedback. By integrating these technologies, the framework empowers VI students to develop coding skills and engage in complex problem-solving tasks. Beyond maze-solving applications, this approach demonstrates the broader potential of computer vision in special education, contributing to improved accessibility and learning experiences in STEAM disciplines.</description>

      <title>FAM-HRI: Foundation-Model Assisted Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction Combining Gaze and Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for enhancing accessibility and usability in real-world robotics applications. However, existing solutions often rely on gestures or language commands, making interaction inefficient and ambiguous, particularly for users with physical impairments. In this paper, we introduce FAM-HRI, an efficient multi-modal framework for human-robot interaction that integrates language and gaze inputs via foundation models. By leveraging lightweight Meta ARIA glasses, our system captures real-time multi-modal signals and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to fuse user intention with scene context, enabling intuitive and precise robot manipulation. Our method accurately determines gaze fixation time interval, reducing noise caused by the gaze dynamic nature. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FAM-HRI achieves a high success rate in task execution while maintaining a low interaction time, providing a practical solution for individuals with limited physical mobility or motor impairments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Expression for Human-Robot Task Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An underlying assumption of many existing approaches to human-robot task communication is that the robot possesses a sufficient amount of environmental domain knowledge, including the locations of task-critical objects. This assumption is unrealistic if the locations of known objects change or have not yet been discovered by the robot. In this work, our key insight is that in many scenarios, robot end users possess more scene insight than the robot and need ways to express it. Presently, there is a lack of research on how solutions for collecting end-user scene insight should be designed. We thereby created an Uncertainty Expression System (UES) to investigate how best to elicit end-user scene insight. The UES allows end users to convey their knowledge of object uncertainty using either: (1) a precision interface that allows meticulous expression of scene insight; (2) a painting interface by which users create a heat map of possible object locations; and (3) a ranking interface by which end users express object locations via an ordered list. We then conducted a user study to compare the effectiveness of these approaches based on the accuracy of scene insight conveyed to the robot, the efficiency at which end users are able to express this scene insight, and both usability and task load. Results indicate that the rank interface is more user friendly and efficient than the precision interface, and that the paint interface is the least accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an iterative, participatory, empirical study that examines the potential of using artificial intelligence, such as social robots and large language models, to support mediation and advocacy for students with disabilities in higher education. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and focus groups conducted with various stakeholders, including disabled students, disabled student representatives, and disability practitioners at the University of Cambridge, this study reports findings relating to understanding the problem space, ideating robotic support and participatory co-design of advocacy support robots. The findings highlight the potential of these technologies in providing signposting and acting as a sounding board or study companion, while also addressing limitations in empathic understanding, trust, equity, and accessibility. We discuss ethical considerations, including intersectional biases, the double empathy problem, and the implications of deploying social robots in contexts shaped by structural inequalities. Finally, we offer a set of recommendations and suggestions for future research, rethinking the notion of corrective technological interventions to tools that empower and amplify self-advocacy.</description>

      <title>The Impact of VR and 2D Interfaces on Human Feedback in Preference-Based Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning robot navigation with human preferences is essential for ensuring comfortable and predictable robot movement in shared spaces, facilitating seamless human-robot coexistence. While preference-based learning methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), enable this alignment, the choice of the preference collection interface may influence the process. Traditional 2D interfaces provide structured views but lack spatial depth, whereas immersive VR offers richer perception, potentially affecting preference articulation. This study systematically examines how the interface modality impacts human preference collection and navigation policy alignment. We introduce a novel dataset of 2,325 human preference queries collected through both VR and 2D interfaces, revealing significant differences in user experience, preference consistency, and policy outcomes. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between immersion, perception, and preference reliability, emphasizing the importance of interface selection in preference-based robot learning. The dataset will be publicly released to support future research.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sensing and Machine Learning to Compare Printed and Verbal Assembly Instructions Delivered by a Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare a manual assembly task communicated to workers using both printed and robot-delivered instructions. The comparison was made using physiological signals (blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA)) collected from individuals during an experimental study. In addition, we also collected responses of individuals using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) survey. Furthermore, we mapped the collected physiological signals to the responses of participants for NASA TLX to predict their workload. For both the classification problems, we compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Results show that for our CNN-based approach using multimodal data (both BVP and EDA) gave better results than using just BVP (approx. 8.38% more) and EDA (approx 20.49% more). Our LSTM-based model too had better results when we used multimodal data (approx 8.38% more than just BVP and 6.70% more than just EDA). Overall, CNNs performed better than LSTMs for classifying physiologies for paper vs robot-based instruction by 7.72%. The CNN-based model was able to give better classification results (approximately 17.83% more on an average across all responses of the NASA TLX) within a few minutes of training compared to the LSTM-based models.</description>

      <title>Second-order Theory of Mind for Human Teachers and Robot Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confusing or otherwise unhelpful learner feedback creates or perpetuates erroneous beliefs that the teacher and learner have of each other, thereby increasing the cognitive burden placed upon the human teacher. For example, the robot's feedback might cause the human to misunderstand what the learner knows about the learning objective or how the learner learns. At the same time -- and in addition to the learning objective -- the learner might misunderstand how the teacher perceives the learner's task knowledge and learning processes. To ease the teaching burden, the learner should provide feedback that accounts for these misunderstandings and elicits efficient teaching from the human. This work endows an AI learner with a Second-order Theory of Mind that models perceived rationality as a source for the erroneous beliefs a teacher and learner may have of one another. It also explores how a learner can ease the teaching burden and improve teacher efficacy if it selects feedback which accounts for its model of the teacher's beliefs about the learner and its learning objective.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) by integrating them with established approaches for open-vocabulary detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing precise segmentation masks and tracking capabilities. Once initialized, this model can then directly extract segmentation masks, allowing processing of image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and corresponding open-vocabulary detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Simulator of a Pastillation Process with Applications to Automatic Control based on Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a digital-twin simulator for a pastillation process. The simulation framework produces realistic thermal image data of the process that is used to train computer vision-based soft sensors based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs); the soft sensors produce output signals for temperature and product flow rate that enable real-time monitoring and feedback control. Pastillation technologies are high-throughput devices that are used in a broad range of industries; these processes face operational challenges such as real-time identification of clog locations (faults) in the rotating shell and the automatic, real-time adjustment of conveyor belt speed and operating conditions to stabilize output. The proposed simulator is able to capture this behavior and generates realistic data that can be used to benchmark different algorithms for image processing and different control architectures. We present a case study to illustrate the capabilities; the study explores behavior over a range of equipment sizes, clog locations, and clog duration. A feedback controller (tuned using Bayesian optimization) is used to adjust the conveyor belt speed based on the CNN output signal to achieve the desired process outputs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Drift Compensation for Soft Sensorized Finger Using Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain sensors are gaining popularity in soft robotics for acquiring tactile data due to their flexibility and ease of integration. Tactile sensing plays a critical role in soft grippers, enabling them to safely interact with unstructured environments and precisely detect object properties. However, a significant challenge with these systems is their high non-linearity, time-varying behavior, and long-term signal drift. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning (CL) approach to model a soft finger equipped with piezoelectric-based strain sensors for proprioception. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose an adaptive CL algorithm that integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a memory buffer for rehearsal and includes a regularization term to keep the model's decision boundary close to the base signal while adapting to time-varying drift. We conduct nine different experiments, resetting the entire setup each time to demonstrate signal drift. We also benchmark our algorithm against two other methods and conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of different components on the overall performance.</description>

      <title>SemanticScanpath: Combining Gaze and Speech for Situated Human-Robot Interaction Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved the conversational capabilities of social robots. Nevertheless, for an intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction, robots should be able to ground the conversation by relating ambiguous or underspecified spoken utterances to the current physical situation and to the intents expressed non verbally by the user, for example by using referential gaze. Here we propose a representation integrating speech and gaze to enable LLMs to obtain higher situated awareness and correctly resolve ambiguous requests. Our approach relies on a text-based semantic translation of the scanpath produced by the user along with the verbal requests and demonstrates LLM's capabilities to reason about gaze behavior, robustly ignoring spurious glances or irrelevant objects. We validate the system across multiple tasks and two scenarios, showing its generality and accuracy, and demonstrate its implementation on a robotic platform, closing the loop from request interpretation to execution.</description>

      <title>World Knowledge from AI Image Generation for Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When interacting with the world robots face a number of difficult questions, having to make decisions when given under-specified tasks where they need to make choices, often without clearly defined right and wrong answers. Humans, on the other hand, can often rely on their knowledge and experience to fill in the gaps. For example, the simple task of organizing newly bought produce into the fridge involves deciding where to put each thing individually, how to arrange them together meaningfully, e.g. putting related things together, all while there is no clear right and wrong way to accomplish this task. We could encode all this information on how to do such things explicitly into the robots' knowledge base, but this can quickly become overwhelming, considering the number of potential tasks and circumstances the robot could encounter. However, images of the real world often implicitly encode answers to such questions and can show which configurations of objects are meaningful or are usually used by humans. An image of a full fridge can give a lot of information about how things are usually arranged in relation to each other and the full fridge at large. Modern generative systems are capable of generating plausible images of the real world and can be conditioned on the environment in which the robot operates. Here we investigate the idea of using the implicit knowledge about the world of modern generative AI systems given by their ability to generate convincing images of the real world to solve under-specified tasks.</description>

      <title>SGFormer: Satellite-Ground Fusion for 3D Semantic Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, camera-based solutions have been extensively explored for scene semantic completion (SSC). Despite their success in visible areas, existing methods struggle to capture complete scene semantics due to frequent visual occlusions. To address this limitation, this paper presents the first satellite-ground cooperative SSC framework, i.e., SGFormer, exploring the potential of satellite-ground image pairs in the SSC task. Specifically, we propose a dual-branch architecture that encodes orthogonal satellite and ground views in parallel, unifying them into a common domain. Additionally, we design a ground-view guidance strategy that corrects satellite image biases during feature encoding, addressing misalignment between satellite and ground views. Moreover, we develop an adaptive weighting strategy that balances contributions from satellite and ground views. Experiments demonstrate that SGFormer outperforms the state of the art on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Our code is available on https://github.com/gxytcrc/SGFormer.</description>

      <title>Safe On-Orbit Dislodging of Deployable Structures via Robust Adaptive MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust adaptive model predictive controller for on-orbit dislodging. We consider the scenario where a servicer, equipped with a robot arm, must dislodge a client, a time-varying system composed of an underpowered jammed solar panel with a hybrid hinge system on a space station. Our approach leverages online set-membership identification to reduce the uncertainty to provide robust safety guarantees during dislodging despite bounded disturbances while balancing exploration and exploitation effectively in the parameter space. The feasibility of the developed robust adaptive MPC method is also examined through dislodging simulations and hardware experiments in zero-gravity and gravity environments, respectively. In addition, the advantages of our method are shown through comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art control schemes for both accuracy of parameter estimation and control performance.</description>

Abstract: As robots enter the messy human world so the vital matter of safety takes on a fresh complexion with physical contact becoming inevitable and even desirable. We report on an artistic-exploration of how dancers, working as part of a multidisciplinary team, engaged in contact improvisation exercises to explore the opportunities and challenges of dancing with cobots. We reveal how they employed their honed bodily senses and physical skills to engage with the robots aesthetically and yet safely, interleaving improvised physical manipulations with reflections to grow their knowledge of how the robots behaved and felt. We introduce somatic safety, a holistic mind-body approach in which safety is learned, felt and enacted through bodily contact with robots in addition to being reasoned about. We conclude that robots need to be better designed for people to hold them and might recognise tacit safety cues among people.We propose that safety should be learned through iterative bodily experience interleaved with reflection.</description>

      <title>Extending Behavior Trees for Robotic Missions with Quality Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context and motivation: In recent years, behavior trees have gained growing interest within the robotics community as a specification and control switching mechanism for the different tasks that form a robotics mission. Problem: Given the rising complexity and prevalence of robotic systems, it is increasingly challenging and important for practitioners to design high-quality missions that meet certain qualities, for instance, to consider potential failures or mitigate safety risks. In software requirements engineering, quality or non-functional requirements have long been recognized as a key factor in system success. Currently, qualities are not represented in behavior tree models, which capture a robotic mission, making it difficult to assess the extent to which different mission components comply with those qualities. Principal ideas: In this paper, we propose an extension for behavior trees to have qualities and quality requirements explicitly represented in robotics missions. We provide a meta-model for the extension, develop a domain-specific language (DSL), and describe how we integrated our DSL in one of the most used languages in robotics for developing behavior trees, BehaviorTree.CPP. A preliminary evaluation of the implemented DSL shows promising results for the feasibility of our approach and the need for similar DSLs. Contribution: Our approach paves the way for incorporating qualities into the behavior model of robotics missions. This promotes early expression of qualities in robotics missions, and a better overview of missions components and their contribution to the satisfaction of quality concerns.</description>

      <title>GAA-TSO: Geometry-Aware Assisted Depth Completion for Transparent and Specular Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent and specular objects are frequently encountered in daily life, factories, and laboratories. However, due to the unique optical properties, the depth information on these objects is usually incomplete and inaccurate, which poses significant challenges for downstream robotics tasks. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately restore the depth information of transparent and specular objects. Previous depth completion methods for these objects usually use RGB information as an additional channel of the depth image to perform depth prediction. Due to the poor-texture characteristics of transparent and specular objects, these methods that rely heavily on color information tend to generate structure-less depth predictions. Moreover, these 2D methods cannot effectively explore the 3D structure hidden in the depth channel, resulting in depth ambiguity. To this end, we propose a geometry-aware assisted depth completion method for transparent and specular objects, which focuses on exploring the 3D structural cues of the scene. Specifically, besides extracting 2D features from RGB-D input, we back-project the input depth to a point cloud and build the 3D branch to extract hierarchical scene-level 3D structural features. To exploit 3D geometric information, we design several gated cross-modal fusion modules to effectively propagate multi-level 3D geometric features to the image branch. In addition, we propose an adaptive correlation aggregation strategy to appropriately assign 3D features to the corresponding 2D features. Extensive experiments on ClearGrasp, OOD, TransCG, and STD datasets show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of downstream robotic grasping tasks.</description>

      <title>Strategic Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Domains: A Weighted Constrained Potential Dynamic Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interactive multi-agent settings, decision-making and planning are challenging mainly due to the agents' interconnected objectives. Dynamic game theory offers a formal framework for analyzing such intricacies. Yet, solving constrained dynamic games and determining the interaction outcome in the form of generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE) pose computational challenges due to the need for solving constrained coupled optimal control problems. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing to leverage the special structure of many real-world multi-agent interactions. More specifically, our key idea is to leverage constrained dynamic potential games, which are games for which GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem associated with minimizing the potential function. We argue that constrained dynamic potential games can effectively facilitate interactive decision-making in many multi-agent interactions. We will identify structures in realistic multi-agent interactive scenarios that can be transformed into weighted constrained potential dynamic games (WCPDGs). We will show that the GNE of the resulting WCPDG can be obtained by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through various simulation studies and show that we achieve significant improvements in solve time compared to state-of-the-art game solvers. We further provide experimental validation of our proposed method in a navigation setup involving two quadrotors carrying a rigid object while avoiding collisions with two humans.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-object grasping is a challenging task. It is important for energy and cost-efficient operation of industrial crane manipulators, such as those used to collect tree logs from the forest floor and on forest machines. In this work, we used synthetic data from physics simulations to explore how data-driven modeling can be used to infer multi-object grasp poses from images. We showed that convolutional neural networks can be trained specifically for synthesizing multi-object grasps. Using RGB-Depth images and instance segmentation masks as input, a U-Net model outputs grasp maps with the corresponding grapple orientation and opening width. Given an observation of a pile of logs, the model can be used to synthesize and rate the possible grasp poses and select the most suitable one, with the possibility to respect changing operational constraints such as lift capacity and reach. When tested on previously unseen data, the proposed model found successful grasp poses with an accuracy up to 96%.</description>

      <title>AlignBot: Aligning VLM-powered Customized Task Planning with User Reminders Through Fine-Tuning for Household Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents AlignBot, a novel framework designed to optimize VLM-powered customized task planning for household robots by effectively aligning with user reminders. In domestic settings, aligning task planning with user reminders poses significant challenges due to the limited quantity, diversity, and multimodal nature of the reminders. To address these challenges, AlignBot employs a fine-tuned LLaVA-7B model, functioning as an adapter for GPT-4o. This adapter model internalizes diverse forms of user reminders-such as personalized preferences, corrective guidance, and contextual assistance-into structured instruction-formatted cues that prompt GPT-4o in generating customized task plans. Additionally, AlignBot integrates a dynamic retrieval mechanism that selects task-relevant historical successes as prompts for GPT-4o, further enhancing task planning accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of AlignBot, experiments are conducted in real-world household environments, which are constructed within the laboratory to replicate typical household settings. A multimodal dataset with over 1,500 entries derived from volunteer reminders is used for training and evaluation. The results demonstrate that AlignBot significantly improves customized task planning, outperforming existing LLM- and VLM-powered planners by interpreting and aligning with user reminders, achieving 86.8% success rate compared to the vanilla GPT-4o baseline at 21.6%, reflecting a 65% improvement and over four times greater effectiveness.

      <title>Bootstrapping Object-level Planning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method that extracts knowledge from a large language model (LLM) to produce object-level plans, which describe high-level changes to object state, and uses them to bootstrap task and motion planning (TAMP). Existing work uses LLMs to directly output task plans or generate goals in representations like PDDL. However, these methods fall short because they rely on the LLM to do the actual planning or output a hard-to-satisfy goal. Our approach instead extracts knowledge from an LLM in the form of plan schemas as an object-level representation called functional object-oriented networks (FOON), from which we automatically generate PDDL subgoals. Our method markedly outperforms alternative planning strategies in completing several pick-and-place tasks in simulation.</description>

      <title>KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908</link>

Abstract: Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

      <title>Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose \textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5\%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.</description>

      <title>SPINE: Online Semantic Planning for Missions with Incomplete Natural Language Specifications in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots infer the relevant details. Because pre-built maps are difficult to obtain in many realistic settings, accomplishing such missions will require the robot to map and plan online. While many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified missions such as object search or exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning abilities over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. However, existing LLM-enabled planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks and semantics are provided by a pre-built map or a user. We address these limitations via SPINE, an online planner for missions with incomplete mission specifications provided in natural language. The planner uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission specification and then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. Tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new map observations. We evaluate SPINE in simulation and real-world settings with missions that require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000m$^2$. Compared to baselines that use existing LLM-enabled planning approaches, our method is over twice as efficient in terms of time and distance, requires less user interactions, and does not require a full map.

      <title>MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, meaning they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We leverage a game-theoretic planner to model interaction outcomes as equilibria where \emph{each equilibrium} corresponds to a distinct interaction \emph{mode}. We then develop an efficient algorithm to identify all the equilibria, allowing robots to reason about multiple interaction modes. More specifically, we formulate interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs) and model interaction outcomes by local Generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of the game. CPTGs are a class of games for which a local GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem where a potential function is minimized. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</description>

      <title>Incremental Learning for Robot Shared Autonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared autonomy holds promise for improving the usability and accessibility of assistive robotic arms, but current methods often rely on costly expert demonstrations and remain static after pretraining, limiting their ability to handle real-world variations. Even with extensive training data, unforeseen challenges--especially those that fundamentally alter task dynamics, such as unexpected obstacles or spatial constraints--can cause assistive policies to break down, leading to ineffective or unreliable assistance. To address this, we propose ILSA, an Incrementally Learned Shared Autonomy framework that continuously refines its assistive policy through user interactions, adapting to real-world challenges beyond the scope of pre-collected data. At the core of ILSA is a structured fine-tuning mechanism that enables continual improvement with each interaction by effectively integrating limited new interaction data while preserving prior knowledge, ensuring a balance between adaptation and generalization. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates ILSA's effectiveness, showing faster task completion and improved user experience compared to static alternatives.

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Recovery with Object-Centric Keypoint Inverse Policy for Visuomotor Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an object-centric recovery (OCR) framework to address the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in visuomotor policy learning. Previous behavior cloning (BC) methods rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data coverage, failing in unfamiliar spatial states. Without relying on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by an inverse policy inferred from the object keypoint manifold gradient in the original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7\% over the base policy in OOD. Furthermore, we show OCR's capacity to autonomously collect demonstrations for continual learning. Overall, we believe this framework represents a step toward improving the robustness of visuomotor policies in real-world settings.

      <title>Robust Nonprehensile Object Transportation with Uncertain Inertial Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonprehensile object transportation task known as the waiter's problem - in which a robot must move an object on a tray from one location to another - when the transported object has uncertain inertial parameters. In contrast to existing approaches that completely ignore uncertainty in the inertia matrix or which only consider small parameter errors, we are interested in pushing the limits of the amount of inertial parameter uncertainty that can be handled. We first show how constraints that are robust to inertial parameter uncertainty can be incorporated into an optimization-based motion planning framework to transport objects while moving quickly. Next, we develop necessary conditions for the inertial parameters to be realizable on a bounding shape based on moment relaxations, allowing us to verify whether a trajectory will violate the constraints for any realizable inertial parameters. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a mobile manipulator in simulations and real hardware experiments: our proposed robust constraints consistently successfully transport a 56 cm tall object with substantial inertial parameter uncertainty in the real world, while the baseline approaches drop the object while transporting it.</description>

Abstract: In response to the growing challenges of manual labor and efficiency in warehouse operations, Amazon has embarked on a significant transformation by incorporating robotics to assist with various tasks. While a substantial number of robots have been successfully deployed for tasks such as item transportation within warehouses, the complex process of object picking from shelves remains a significant challenge. This project addresses the issue by developing an innovative robotic system capable of autonomously fulfilling a simulated order by efficiently selecting specific items from shelves. A distinguishing feature of the proposed robotic system is its capacity to navigate the challenge of uncertain object positions within each bin of the shelf. The system is engineered to autonomously adapt its approach, employing strategies that enable it to efficiently locate and retrieve the desired items, even in the absence of pre-established knowledge about their placements.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Attitude Estimation and Control</title>

Abstract: The real-world application of small drones is mostly hampered by energy limitations. Neuromorphic computing promises extremely energy-efficient AI for autonomous flight but is still challenging to train and deploy on real robots. To reap the maximal benefits from neuromorphic computing, it is necessary to perform all autonomy functions end-to-end on a single neuromorphic chip, from low-level attitude control to high-level navigation. This research presents the first neuromorphic control system using a spiking neural network (SNN) to effectively map a drone's raw sensory input directly to motor commands. We apply this method to low-level attitude estimation and control for a quadrotor, deploying the SNN on a tiny Crazyflie. We propose a modular SNN, separately training and then merging estimation and control sub-networks. The SNN is trained with imitation learning, using a flight dataset of sensory-motor pairs. Post-training, the network is deployed on the Crazyflie, issuing control commands from sensor inputs at 500Hz. Furthermore, for the training procedure we augmented training data by flying a controller with additional excitation and time-shifting the target data to enhance the predictive capabilities of the SNN. On the real drone, the perception-to-control SNN tracks attitude commands with an average error of 3.0 degrees, compared to 2.7 degrees for the regular flight stack. We also show the benefits of the proposed learning modifications for reducing the average tracking error and reducing oscillations. Our work shows the feasibility of performing neuromorphic end-to-end control, laying the basis for highly energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic autopilots.</description>

      <title>GAPartManip: A Large-scale Part-centric Dataset for Material-Agnostic Articulated Object Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively manipulating articulated objects in household scenarios is a crucial step toward achieving general embodied artificial intelligence. Mainstream research in 3D vision has primarily focused on manipulation through depth perception and pose detection. However, in real-world environments, these methods often face challenges due to imperfect depth perception, such as with transparent lids and reflective handles. Moreover, they generally lack the diversity in part-based interactions required for flexible and adaptable manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduced a large-scale part-centric dataset for articulated object manipulation that features both photo-realistic material randomization and detailed annotations of part-oriented, scene-level actionable interaction poses. We evaluated the effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Learning Robot Manipulation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</description>

      <title>iKap: Kinematics-aware Planning with Imperative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems have gained increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly works with various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex environments.</description>

      <title>Global SLAM Using 5G ToA Integration: Performance Analysis with Unknown Base Stations and Loop Closure Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12406v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates 5G Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements into ORB-SLAM3 to enable global localization and enhance mapping capabilities for indoor drone navigation. We extend ORB-SLAM3's optimization pipeline to jointly process ToA data from 5G base stations alongside visual and inertial measurements while estimating system biases. This integration transforms the inherently local SLAM estimates into globally referenced trajectories and effectively resolves scale ambiguity in monocular configurations. Our method is evaluated using both Aerolab indoor datasets with RGB-D cameras and the EuRoC MAV benchmark, complemented by simulated 5G ToA measurements at 28 GHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa. Extensive experiments across multiple SLAM configurations demonstrate that ToA integration enables consistent global positioning across all modes while maintaining local accuracy. For monocular configurations, ToA integration successfully resolves scale ambiguity and improves consistency. We further investigate scenarios with unknown base station positions and demonstrate that ToA measurements can effectively serve as an alternative to loop closure for drift correction. We also analyze how different geometric arrangements of base stations impact SLAM performance. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods, including UWB-VO, confirms our approach's robustness even with lower measurement frequencies and sequential base station operation. The results validate that 5G ToA integration provides substantial benefits for global SLAM applications, particularly in challenging indoor environments where accurate positioning is critical.</description>

      <title>SOUS VIDE: Cooking Visual Drone Navigation Policies in a Gaussian Splatting Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new simulator, training approach, and policy architecture, collectively called SOUS VIDE, for end-to-end visual drone navigation. Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only onboard perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k image/state-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level thrust and body rate commands at 20 Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a learned module for low-level control that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field. Code, data, and experiment videos can be found on our project page: https://stanfordmsl.github.io/SousVide/.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Modeling Framework for Estimation and Ground Segmentation of Cluttered Staircases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation in complex environments requires robust perception as well as high-level scene understanding due to perceptual challenges, such as occlusions, and uncertainty introduced by robot movement. For example, a robot climbing a cluttered staircase can misinterpret clutter as a step, misrepresenting the state and compromising safety. This requires robust state estimation methods capable of inferring the underlying structure of the environment even from incomplete sensor data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for robust state estimation of staircases. To address the challenge of perceiving occluded staircases extending beyond the robot's field-of-view, our approach combines an infinite-width staircase representation with a finite endpoint state to capture the overall staircase structure. This representation is integrated into a Bayesian inference framework to fuse noisy measurements enabling accurate estimation of staircase location even with partial observations and occlusions. Additionally, we present a segmentation algorithm that works in conjunction with the staircase estimation pipeline to accurately identify clutter-free regions on a staircase. Our method is extensively evaluated on real robot across diverse staircases, demonstrating significant improvements in estimation accuracy and segmentation performance compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Robotic In-Hand Manipulation for Large-Range Precise Object Movement: The RGMC Champion Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation using multiple dexterous fingers is a critical robotic skill that can reduce the reliance on large arm motions, thereby saving space and energy. This letter focuses on in-grasp object movement, which refers to manipulating an object to a desired pose through only finger motions within a stable grasp. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision and large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp. To address this problem, we propose a simple and practical approach based on kinematic trajectory optimization with no need for pretraining or object geometries, which can be easily applied to novel objects in real-world scenarios. Adopting this approach, we won the championship for the in-hand manipulation track at the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024. Implementation details, discussion, and further quantitative experimental results are presented in this letter, which aims to comprehensively evaluate our approach and share our key takeaways from the competition.

Abstract: Humans are able to convey different messages using only touch. Equipping robots with the ability to understand social touch adds another modality in which humans and robots can communicate. In this paper, we present a social gesture recognition system using a fabric-based, large-scale tactile sensor placed onto the arms of a humanoid robot. We built a social gesture dataset using multiple participants and extracted temporal features for classification. By collecting tactile data on a humanoid robot, our system provides insights into human-robot social touch, and displays that the use of fabric based sensors could be a potential way of advancing the development of spHRI systems for more natural and effective communication.</description>

      <title>Fish Mouth Inspired Origami Gripper for Robust Multi-Type Underwater Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic grasping and manipulation in underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic hands traditionally used on land. These challenges stem from dynamic water conditions, a wide range of object properties from soft to stiff, irregular object shapes, and varying surface frictions. One common approach involves developing finger-based hands with embedded compliance using underactuation and soft actuators. This study introduces an effective alternative solution that does not rely on finger-based hand designs. We present a fish mouth inspired origami gripper that utilizes a single degree of freedom to perform a variety of robust grasping tasks underwater. The innovative structure transforms a simple uniaxial pulling motion into a grasping action based on the Yoshimura crease pattern folding. The origami gripper offers distinct advantages, including scalable and optimizable design, grasping compliance, and robustness, with four grasping types: pinch, power grasp, simultaneous grasping of multiple objects, and scooping from the seabed. In this work, we detail the design, modeling, fabrication, and validation of a specialized underwater gripper capable of handling various marine creatures, including jellyfish, crabs, and abalone. By leveraging an origami and bio-inspired approach, the presented gripper demonstrates promising potential for robotic grasping and manipulation in underwater environments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles, sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.</description>

      <title>Contraction Theory for Nonlinear Stability Analysis and Learning-based Control: A Tutorial Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit the systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Camera and Lidar Simulation Models for Autonomous Driving: A Review from Generative Models to Volume Renderers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception sensors, particularly camera and Lidar, are key elements of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) that enable them to comprehend their surroundings to informed driving and control decisions. Therefore, developing realistic simulation models for these sensors is essential for conducting effective simulation-based testing of ADS. Moreover, the rise of deep learning-based perception models has increased the utility of sensor simulation models for synthesising diverse training datasets. The traditional sensor simulation models rely on computationally expensive physics-based algorithms, specifically in complex systems such as ADS. Hence, the current potential resides in data-driven approaches, fuelled by the exceptional performance of deep generative models in capturing high-dimensional data distribution and volume renderers in accurately representing scenes. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art data-driven camera and Lidar simulation models and their evaluation methods. It explores a spectrum of models from the novel perspective of generative models and volume renderers. Generative models are discussed in terms of their input-output types, while volume renderers are categorised based on their input encoding. Finally, the paper illustrates commonly used evaluation techniques for assessing sensor simulation models and highlights the existing research gaps in the area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of target search and tracking using a fleet of cooperating UAVs evolving in some unknown region of interest containing an a priori unknown number of moving ground targets. Each drone is equipped with an embedded Computer Vision System (CVS), providing an image with labeled pixels and a depth map of the observed part of its environment. Moreover, a box containing the corresponding pixels in the image frame is available when a UAV identifies a target. Hypotheses regarding information provided by the pixel classification, depth map construction, and target identification algorithms are proposed to allow its exploitation by set-membership approaches. A set-membership target location estimator is developed using the information provided by the CVS. Each UAV evaluates sets guaranteed to contain the location of the identified targets and a set possibly containing the locations of targets still to be identified. Then, each UAV uses these sets to search and track targets cooperatively.</description>

      <title>3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</description>

      <title>HOTFormerLoc: Hierarchical Octree Transformer for Versatile Lidar Place Recognition Across Ground and Aerial Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HOTFormerLoc, a novel and versatile Hierarchical Octree-based TransFormer, for large-scale 3D place recognition in both ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial scenarios across urban and forest environments. We propose an octree-based multi-scale attention mechanism that captures spatial and semantic features across granularities. To address the variable density of point distributions from spinning lidar, we present cylindrical octree attention windows to reflect the underlying distribution during attention. We introduce relay tokens to enable efficient global-local interactions and multi-scale representation learning at reduced computational cost. Our pyramid attentional pooling then synthesises a robust global descriptor for end-to-end place recognition in challenging environments. In addition, we introduce CS-Wild-Places, a novel 3D cross-source dataset featuring point cloud data from aerial and ground lidar scans captured in dense forests. Point clouds in CS-Wild-Places contain representational gaps and distinctive attributes such as varying point densities and noise patterns, making it a challenging benchmark for cross-view localisation in the wild. HOTFormerLoc achieves a top-1 average recall improvement of 5.5% - 11.5% on the CS-Wild-Places benchmark. Furthermore, it consistently outperforms SOTA 3D place recognition methods, with an average performance gain of 4.9% on well-established urban and forest datasets.

      <title>SuperPC: A Single Diffusion Model for Point Cloud Completion, Upsampling, Denoising, and Colorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point cloud (PC) processing tasks-such as completion, upsampling, denoising, and colorization-are crucial in applications like autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. Despite substantial advancements, prior approaches often address each of these tasks independently, with separate models focused on individual issues. However, this isolated approach fails to account for the fact that defects like incompleteness, low resolution, noise, and lack of color frequently coexist, with each defect influencing and correlating with the others. Simply applying these models sequentially can lead to error accumulation from each model, along with increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we introduce SuperPC, the first unified diffusion model capable of concurrently handling all four tasks. Our approach employs a three-level-conditioned diffusion framework, enhanced by a novel spatial-mix-fusion strategy, to leverage the correlations among these four defects for simultaneous, efficient processing. We show that SuperPC outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models as well as their combination on all four individual tasks.</description>

      <title>These Magic Moments: Differentiable Uncertainty Quantification of Radiance Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to uncertainty quantification for radiance fields by leveraging higher-order moments of the rendering equation. Uncertainty quantification is crucial for downstream tasks including view planning and scene understanding, where safety and robustness are paramount. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of radiance fields pose significant challenges for uncertainty quantification, limiting the use of these uncertainty quantification methods in high-speed decision-making. We demonstrate that the probabilistic nature of the rendering process enables efficient and differentiable computation of higher-order moments for radiance field outputs, including color, depth, and semantic predictions. Our method outperforms existing radiance field uncertainty estimation techniques while offering a more direct, computationally efficient, and differentiable formulation without the need for post-processing. Beyond uncertainty quantification, we also illustrate the utility of our approach in downstream applications such as next-best-view (NBV) selection and active ray sampling for neural radiance field training. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes confirm the efficacy of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining simplicity.</description>
