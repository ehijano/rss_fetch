      <title>Reducing dislocation defect levels via sub-melt nanosecond pulsed-laser induced densification of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations and polishing-induced defect networks in synthetic diamond generate local strain fields that broaden Raman features and limit optical, thermal, and electronic performance. Sub-melt laser annealing has emerged as a route to repair near-surface defects without graphitization, yet quantitative evidence of densification, defect depletion, and property recovery remains limited. Here, we show that nanosecond pulsed-laser annealing (PLA) can relax dislocation-associated strain in single-crystal CVD diamond by compacting and reorganizing the damaged near-surface region. Single- and two-pulse PLA were applied, and structural evolution was quantified using co-registered ISO 25178 white-light interferometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and cross-sectional STEM with geometric phase analysis (GPA). Across a 5x6 grid(n = 30), responsive regions show large reductions in local slope (Sdq 45-65%), developed area (Sdr 60-90%), height spread (Sp, Sz 30-65%), void volume (Vv 57-60%), and roughness amplitude (Sa, Sq 48-57%), consistent with densification of ~4-6.5 nm. Raman profiling reveals narrowing of the diamond line and improved spectral uniformity to depths of ~2-3 {\mu}m, indicating relaxation of dislocation-mediated strain beyond the compaction layer. STEM-GPA strain maps confirm smoother strain fields, reduced hotspots, and redistribution of localized strain concentrations after PLA. These results show that sub-melt PLA reduces dislocation-driven strain by compacting surface-connected free volume and reorganizing defect networks. The approach provides a scalable path to upgrade industrial-grade diamond including homoepitaxial, heteroepitaxial, and polycrystalline CVD to low-defect, device-ready surfaces relevant to high-power electronics, photonics, and quantum substrates.</description>

      <title>Injection dynamics in spin-wave active ring oscillator (SWARO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated injection locking in spin-wave active ring oscillators (SWAROs) operating in the multi-mode regime. By applying external RF signals with varying frequency and power, we identified the locking behavior of individual modes and extracted the total locking ranges from spectral measurements. The results show asymmetric evolution of the lower and upper locking boundaries with drive power for the lower-frequency SWARO modes, while the highest-frequency mode exhibits nearly symmetric behavior. A maxi- mum locking range of over 11 MHz is observed at a drive power of -10 dBm. To interpret these results, we develop an Adler-like model that captures the dependence of the locking range on drive power, showing good agreement for the higher-frequency modes. For the lowest-frequency mode, however, the model underestimates the locking range at low drive and saturates at high drive power levels, while the experimental range increases mono- tonically, indicating the influence of multi-mode interactions. These findings establish SWARO as a useful platform for exploring injection phenomena in spin-wave ring systems with delayed feedback and motivate the development of extended injection models that account for multi-mode dynamics.</description>

      <title>Normal form computation of nonlinear dispersion relationship for locally resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the application of the parametrisation method for invariant manifold with a complex normal form style (CNF), for the derivation of high-order approximations of underdamped nonlinear dispersion relationships for periodic structures, more specifically by considering the case of a locally resonant metamaterial chain incorporating damping and various nonlinear stiffnesses. Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures.</description>

      <title>SATMO: a Multi-Planet Thermal Analysis Tool for CubeSat Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of commercial launch capabilities has significantly increased opportunities for interplanetary small satellite (SmallSat) missions. As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\circ$C for a 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users. SATMO offers increased accessibility to satellite thermal modeling for the research community, enabling quick thermal trade studies and interplanetary mission plans.</description>

      <title>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hole Mobility in Monolayer $WSe_{2}$ p-FETs via Process-Induced Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between strain, interfacial mechanics, and electrical performance is critical for designing beyond silicon electronics based on hetero-integrated 2D materials. Through combined experiment and simulation, we demonstrated and analyzed the enhancement of hole mobility in p-type monolayer $WSe_{2}$ field effect transistors (FETs) under biaxial compression. We tracked FET performance versus strain by incrementing compressive strain to $WSe_{2}$ channels via sequential AlOx deposition and performing intermediate photoluminescence and transport measurements. The hole mobility factor increased at a rate of 340 $\pm$ 95 %/%$\epsilon$, and the on-current factor increased at a rate of 460 $\pm$ 340 %/%$\epsilon$. Simulation revealed that the enhancement under compression arises primarily from a reduction in inter-valley scattering between the $\Gamma$--K valence bands, and the rate is robust against variations in carrier density, impurity density, or dielectric environment. These findings show that compressive strain is a powerful technique for enhancing performance in 2D p-FETs and that it is multiplicative with defect and doping engineering.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An extended low-frequency noise compact model for single-layer graphene FETs including correlated mobility fluctuations effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated mobility fluctuations are considered in the physics-based carrier number fluctuation deltaN low-frequency noise (LFN) compact model of single-layer graphene field effect transistors (GFET) in the present study. Trapped charge density and Coulomb scattering coefficient deltaN LFN parameters are obtained after applying a parameter extraction methodology, adapted from conventional silicon technologies, to the linear ambipolar regions of GFETs. Appropriate adjustments are considered in the method according to GFETs physical characteristics. Afterwards, Hooge mobility as well as series resistance fluctuations LFN parameters can be extracted. The updated LFN model is validated with experimental data from various long and short-channel GFETs at an extended range of gate and drain bias conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Recently, chaotic phenomena in laser dynamics have attracted much attention to its applied aspects, and a synchronization phenomenon, leader-laggard relationship, in time-delay coupled lasers has been used in reinforcement learning. In the present paper, we discuss the possibility of capturing the essential stochasticity of the leader-laggard relationship; in nonlinear science, it is known that coarse-graining allows one to derive stochastic models from deterministic systems. We derive stochastic models with the aid of the Koopman operator approach, and we clarify that the low-pass filtered data is enough to recover the essential features of the original deterministic chaos, such as peak shifts in the distribution of being the leader and a power-law behavior in the distribution of switching-time intervals. We also confirm that the derived stochastic model works well in reinforcement learning tasks, i.e., multi-armed bandit problems, as with the original laser chaos system.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Predicting Spatiotemporal Intensity and Variability of Outdoor Thermal Comfort</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal conditions in the urban canopy exhibit stochastic variability driven by varied radiative fluxes and turbulent wind fields, requiring probabilistic rather than deterministic prediction methods. This study presents a probabilistic framework for predicting the spatial and temporal intensity and variability of outdoor thermal comfort in tropical urban environments. The framework integrates ground-measured meteorological data and remote sensing urban morphological data to calculate Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), and applies K-means, XGBoost, and Monte Carlo simulations on PET training and inference. The prediction model achieved strong performance, with R2, RMSE, and SMAPE values of 0.93, 0.81 degC, and 1.34% for PET_mean, and 0.85, 0.38 degC, and 10.44% for PET_std, respectively. A case study showed clear spatial heterogeneity of outdoor thermal comfort. Locations with dense tree canopies and vegetated surfaces displayed a normalized percentage of acceptable thermal comfort (NATC) up to 65%, whereas built-up zones dominated by impervious surfaces, such as industrial estates and high-density residential areas, recorded NATC below 30%. Greenery was found to mitigate both the intensity of heat stress and its variability, producing a stable and comfortable microclimate. Daytime PET_std ranged from 4.0-4.5 degC in built-up areas to 1.5-2.0 degC in greenery-covered zones, while nighttime PET_std decreased to 2.2-2.4 degC and 1.2-1.4 degC, respectively. These findings emphasize the critical role of greenery in mitigating thermal variability and enhancing outdoor thermal comfort, while revealing the stochastic nature of thermal comfort across different urban morphologies.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic waves to monitor active THz metagrating based on VO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new approach to in-situ monitor the altered states of pixels in VO2 based active THz amplitude metagrating by using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated in LiNbO3 substrate. A single broadband RF response of the SAW device consists of N narrowband frequency channels which code the feedback information on the current pixels states. This way the resistance alteration due to metal-to-insulator transition of all VO2 based pixels of the active THz grating is monitored in advance even without incident radiation. The method provides important new options of monitoring a metasurface aging as well as incorrect switching related to technological defects. Using of the SAW device in all-electrically addressed VO2 based binary grating with tunable period as well as advanced gradient type gratings are modeled.</description>

Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
