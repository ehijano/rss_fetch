      <title>A short proof of confinement in three-dimensional lattice gauge theories with a central $\mathrm{U}(1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure lattice gauge theories in three dimensions are widely expected to confine. A rigorous proof of confinement for three-dimensional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with Villain action was given by G\"opfert and Mack. Beyond the abelian case, rigorous confinement results are comparatively scarce; one general mechanism applies when the gauge group has a central copy of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. Indeed, combining a comparison inequality of Fr{\"o}hlich with earlier work of Glimm and Jaffe yields confinement with a logarithmically growing quark-antiquark potential for this class of theories. The purpose of this note is to give a short, self-contained proof of this classical result for three-dimensional Wilson lattice gauge theory: when $G\subseteq \mathrm{U}(n)$ contains the full circle of scalar matrices $\{zI:\ |z|=1\}$, rectangular Wilson loops obey an explicit upper bound of the form $\lvert\langle W_\ell\rangle\rvert \le n\exp\{-c(1+n\beta)^{-1}T\log(R+1)\}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral moments of Bures-Hall ensemble and applications to entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectral moments of the Bures-Hall random matrices ensemble. The main result establishes a recurrence relation for the $k$-th spectral moment valid for a real-valued $k$, in contrast to prevailing results in the literature of different ensembles of assuming an integer $k$. The key to establish the recurrence relation is the obtained Christoffel-Darboux formulas of correlation kernels of the ensemble that avoid tedious summations. As an application of our spectral moment results, we re-derive the formulas of average von Neumann entropy and quantum purity of Bures-Hall ensemble conjectured by Ayana Sarkar and Santosh Kumar. This work is dedicated to the memory of Santosh Kumar.</description>

      <title>General teleparallel geometric theory of defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization for the random XXZ spin chain in fixed energy intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key signature of MBL (many-body localization) is the slow rate at which information spreads. It is shown that the infinite random Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain exhibits slow propagation of information (logarithmic light cone) in any arbitrary but fixed energy interval. The relevant parameter regime, which covers both weak interaction and strong disorder, is determined solely by the energy interval.</description>

      <title>Special values of spectral zeta functions of one-, two-photon quantum Rabi models and non-commutative harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find explicit expressions of the special values of the Hurwitz-type spectral zeta function $\zeta(\mathrm{H};n,\lambda)$ for the Hamiltonians $\mathrm{H}$ of the one-photon quantum Rabi model (1pQRM), the two-photon quantum Rabi model (2pQRM), and the non-commutative harmonic oscillator (NCHO), at positive integers $n$. Then the 1st term of the spectral zeta function of 1pQRM gives a generalization of Beukers' integral used for the proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(2)$ after Ap\'ery's work. A similar expression of the 1st term of that of 2pQRM is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Relative Rota-Baxter operators and crossed homomorphisms on Lie 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relative Rota-Baxter operator on Lie 2-groups is introduced as a pair of relative Rota-Baxter operators on the underlying Lie groups which is also a Lie groupoid morphism. Such an operator induces a factorization theorem for Lie 2-groups and gives rise to a categorical solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We further define relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie group crossed modules. The well-known one-to-one correspondence between Lie 2-groups and crossed modules is extended to an equivalence between the respective relative Rota-Baxter operators on these two structures. Finally, as the formal inverse of relative Rota-Baxter operators, crossed homomorphisms on Lie 2-groups are also studied.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Brownian Motion with its Rheological Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the Brownian motion of probe microparticles with mass m and radius R immersed in a viscoelastic material reveals valuable information about repetitive patterns and correlation structures that manifest in the frequency domain. In this paper, we employ a viscous viscoelastic correspondence principle for Brownian motion and we show that the power spectrum of Brownian motion in any linear, isotropic viscoelastic material is proportional to the real part of the complex dynamic fluidity of a linear rheological network that is a parallel connection of the linear viscoelastic material within which the Brownian particles are immersed and an inerter, with distributed intrance with mass mR. The synthesis of this rheological analogue simplifies appreciably the calculation of the power spectrum for Brownian motion within viscoelastic materials such as Maxwell fluids, Jeffreys fluids, subdiffusive materials, or in dense viscous fluids that give rise to hydrodynamic memory.</description>

      <title>Discrete holography and density of states in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tight-binding models in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices, realized through the successive insertion of Euclidean defects into hyperbolic lattices. We analyze how the holographic two-point boundary correlation function and bulk density of states evolve as defects are gradually introduced. We find that bulk properties are strongly affected by the presence of Euclidean defects, whereas boundary observables remain remarkably robust even at high defect fractions. This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>

      <title>Three self-similar solutions of Yang-Mills equations in high odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric Yang-Mills equations with gauge group $SO(d)$ in $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. For any given odd $d\geq 11$, we establish existence and uniqueness (modulo reflection symmetry) of exactly $N$ smooth self-similar solutions, where $N$ is the number of zeros of an explicit polynomial $P_m(z)$ of degree $m=(d-5)/2$ in the interval $0&lt;z&lt;1$. The number $N$ can be determined algorithmically by an explicit computation. We find that $N=3$ for all integer $m$ from $3$ to $15$, the upper bound being merely limited by the extent of our computations. A proof that $N=3$ for all odd $d\ge 11$ remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Path integrals and deformation quantization:the fermionic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis addresses a fundamental problem in deformation quantization: the difficulty of calculating the star-exponential, the symbol of the evolution operator, due to convergence issues. Inspired by the formalism that connects the star-exponential with the quantum propagator for bosonic systems, this work develops the analogous extension for the fermionic case. A rigorous method, based on Grassmann variables and coherent states, is constructed to obtain a closed-form expression for the fermionic star-exponential from its associated propagator. As a primary application, a fermionic version of the Feynman-Kac formula is derived within this formalism, allowing for the calculation of the ground state energy directly in phase space. Finally, the method is validated by successfully applying it to the simple and driven harmonic oscillators, where it is demonstrated that a simplified ("naive") approach (with an ad-hoc "remediation") is a valid weak-coupling limit of the rigorous ("meticulous") formalism, thereby providing a new and powerful computational tool for the study of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Gauged Courant sigma models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of sigma models based on Courant sigma models. We refer to these models as gauged Courant sigma models (GCSMs). By introducing additional gauge symmetries, such as those associated with a Lie group, a Lie groupoid (or Lie algebroid), and a Courant algebroid on the target space, Courant sigma models are extended to gauged sigma models of AKSZ type. The consistency of the theory is ensured by identities among geometric quantities on Lie algebroids and Courant algebroids, such as curvatures and torsions, which can be interpreted as flatness conditions on the target space. We also analyze geometric structures of GCSMs in the presence of fluxes and boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We study the joint distribution of SYK Hamiltonians for different systems with specified overlaps. We show that, in the large-system limit, their joint distribution converges in distribution to a mixed $q$-Gaussian system. We explain that the graph product of diffusive abelian von Neumann algebras is isomorphic to a $W^*$-probability space generated by the corresponding $\varepsilon$-freely independent random variables with semicircular laws which form a special case of mixed $q$-Gaussian systems that can be approximated by our SYK Hamiltonian models. Thus, we obtain a random model for asymptotic $\varepsilon$-freeness.</description>

      <title>Higher-order transformations of bidirectional quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bidirectional devices are devices for which the roles of the input and output ports can be exchanged. Mathematically, these devices are described by bistochastic quantum channels, namely completely positive linear maps that are both trace-preserving and identity-preserving. Recently, it has been shown that bidirectional quantum devices can, in principle, be used in ways that are incompatible with a definite input-output direction, giving rise to a new phenomenon called input-output indefiniteness. Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes. On the foundational side, the hierarchy of higher-order transformations characterized here can be regarded as the largest set of physical processes compatible with a time-symmetric variant of quantum theory, where the possible state transformations are restricted to bistochastic channels.</description>

      <title>Learning Heat-based Equations in Self-similar variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solution learning for heat-based equations in self-similar variables (SSV). We develop an SSV training framework compatible with standard neural-operator training. We instantiate this framework on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, and perform controlled comparisons between models trained in physical coordinates and in the corresponding self-similar coordinates using two simple fully connected architectures (standard multilayer perceptrons and a factorized fully connected network). Across both systems and both architectures, SSV-trained networks consistently deliver substantially more accurate and stable extrapolation beyond the training window and better capture qualitative long-time trends. These results suggest that self-similar coordinates provide a mathematically motivated inductive bias for learning the long-time dynamics of heat-based equations.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to explain the structure, general strategy, and main ideas of the proof in the work of Huang, McKenzie, and Yau (2024) on the Ramanujan property and edge universality of random regular graphs. The core of the argument is the derivation of self-consistent equations and a microscopic version of the loop equations for random $d$-regular graphs. We first recall the local law for random $d$-regular graphs, and then illustrate the main ideas behind the derivation of the self-consistent equations and the first loop equation.</description>

      <title>Superconcentration and chaos in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chemical distance of supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Recently, Dembin [Dem22] showed that the chemical distance exhibits sublinear variance, a phenomenon now referred to as superconcentration. In this article, we establish an equivalence between this phenomenon and chaotic behavior of geodesics under small perturbations of the configuration, thereby confirming Chatterjee's general principle relating anomalous fluctuations to chaos in the context of Bernoulli percolation. Our methods rely on a dynamical version of the effective radius, refining the notion first proposed in [CN25], in order to measure the co-influence of a given edge whose weight may be infinite. Together with techniques from the theory of lattice animals, this approach allows us to quantify the total co-influence of edges in terms of the overlap between original and perturbed geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the work of Gal'perin (Comm. Math. Phys. 154: 63-84, 1993), we investigate generalizations of the concepts of centroids and static equilibrium points of a convex body in spherical, hyperbolic and normed spaces. In addition, we examine the minimum number of equilibrium points a $2$- or $3$-dimensional convex body can have in these spaces. In particular, we show that every plane convex body in any of these spaces has at least four equilibrium points, and that there are mono-monostatic convex bodies in $3$-dimensional spherical, hyperbolic, and certain normed spaces. Our results are generalizations of results of Domokos, Papadopoulos and Ruina (J. Elasticity 36: 59-66, 1994), and V\'arkonyi and Domokos (J. Nonlinear Sci. 16: 255-281, 2006) for convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work we were able to define a non-additive measure that can be used to represent both classical and quantum states in physics. We further extended this idea to work on a generic space of statistical ensembles (i.e. an ensemble space) in a way that connects to Choquet theory. The question of which non-additive integral is suitable to generalize the notion of expectation value remains open. In this paper we show that the Sugeno and Choquet integrals are not suitable.</description>

      <title>Regularization for Multi-Phase 2D Euler Equations via Competing Transport Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization framework for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation that exactly preserves the transport structure of multi-phase vorticity fields. The key step is a reformulation of multi-phase vortex patch data in terms of a finite family of passively advected scalar marker functions: at each point, the local vorticity is determined by a smooth, pointwise selection rule arising from competition among these markers. The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $\beta\to\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$\beta$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gradient Existence and Energy Finiteness of Local Minimizers in the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ Topology for Binary-Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we refine and complement McCann's results on binary-star systems \cite{McC06}, a compressible fluid model governed by the Euler-Poisson equations. We consider a general form of the equation of state that includes polytropic gaseous stars indexed by $\gamma$ as a special case. Beyond revisiting McCann's framework and conclusions -- where solutions to the Euler-Poisson equations are obtained as local energy minimizers via variational methods under the topology induced by the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ distance -- we focus on a detailed exploration of the properties of local energy minimizers in this topology, addressing three key aspects: (1) the feasibility of transitioning from the Euler-Lagrange equation to the Euler-Poisson equation by demonstrating gradient existence; (2) the existence of $L^\infty$ functions within neighborhoods in this topology; and (3) the finiteness of the energy of local minimizers in this topology, contrasted with the non-existence of finite-energy local minimizers and the existence of infinite-energy weak local minimizers in the topology inherited from topological vector spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb-Sturmian functions are complete, orthonormal, and include the full spectrum of continuum states. They are restricted to integer values of quantum numbers, as imposed by boundary and orthonormality conditions. Bagci-Hoggan exponential-type orbitals remove this restriction through a generalization to quantum number with fractional order. The differential equations for N-dimensional Bagci-Hoggan orbitals are derived. It is demonstrated that Coulomb-Sturmian functions satisfy a particular case of these equations. Additionally, Guseinov's Psi-alpha-ETOs are identified as N-dimensional Coulomb-Sturmians with a shifted dimensional parameter alpha, rather than representing an independent complete orthonormal sets of basis in a weighted Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming for understanding limitations of Lindblad equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these proceedings we will review recent progress in applying ideas from the mathematical framework of twisted cohomology to the study of canonical differential equations for Feynman integrals. Firstly, we will show how the intersection matrix can shed some light on the nature of the canonical basis of a Feynman integral family, a concept still not fully understood in the general case. In particular we will show how the intersection matrix can detect hidden linear dependencies of the iterated integrals resulting from an $\eps$-factorized differential equation, which are difficult to find otherwise. Furthermore, we will explain how the intersection matrix can help in deriving (polynomial) relations between the transcendental functions occurring in the rotation to the canonical basis. This allows us to simplify the rotation, and furthermore leads to simplifications in the final result. The discussion we be kept as light as possible, focusing on a simple running example and deferring the technical details to the original publications.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The soliton nature of the super-Klein tunneling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the Davey--Stewartson II (DS II) integrable system in $(2{+}1)$ dimensions and quasi-exactly solvable planar interacting Dirac Hamiltonians that exhibit the super-Klein tunneling (SKT) effect. The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum clock and Newtonian time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extension of standard quantum mechanics is proposed in which the Newtonian time parameter appearing in the unitary evolution operator is replaced with the time shown by a `quantum clock'. A quantum clock is defined by the following properties: (a) the time that the clock shows is non-decreasing, (b) the clock ticks at random with random tick sizes, and (c) on average the clock shows the Newtonian time. We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation. Modifications to the von Neumann equation are worked out in detail in a parametric family of examples for which the tick sizes have a gamma distribution. The leading correction to the von Neumann equation is given by the Lindblad equation generated by the Hamiltonian, but there are higher-order terms that generalize the von Neumann equation and the Lindblad equation. Lower bounds on the parameters of these quantum clock models are derived by use of the precision limit of an atomic clock.</description>

      <title>A Schwinger-Keldysh Formulation of Semiclassical Operator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate domains in Minkowski space that are Gromov hyperbolic with respect to a Kobayashi-like metric introduced by Markowitz in the 1980s. For convex, future complete domains, Gromov hyperbolicity is shown to be equivalent to the stable acausality of the boundary. An analogous characterization is obtained for bounded, convex, causally convex domains in terms of the stable acausality of their Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose causal boundaries. Our approach is based on explicit comparisons between the Markowitz metric, the Sormani--Vega null distance and the quasi-hyperbolic metric. We also make use of dynamical arguments similar to those of Benoist and Zimmer in projective and complex geometry. Finally, we compare the Markowitz metric to the Hilbert metric.</description>

Abstract: Collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids at long wavelengths are thought to be of a generally covariant geometric nature, governed by area-preserving diffeomorphisms ($\mathrm{SDiff}$). But current analyses rely solely on the corresponding perturbative $w_\infty$ Lie algebra. We argue this is insufficient: We identify a non-perturbative construction of the effective Maxwell-Chern-Simons quantum field theory which carries unitary $\mathrm{SDiff}$ equivariance. But this turns out to be non-differentiable, suggesting FQH excitation phenomenology beyond the $w_\infty$ algebra.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>

      <title>On the discrete spectrum of non-selfadjoint operators with applications to Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For relatively form-compact perturbations of non-negative selfadjoint operators, we obtain an upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues in half-planes separated from the positive real axis. The bound is given in terms of a partial trace of the real part of the Birman--Schwinger operator, or an appropriate rotation thereof. As an application to Schr\"odinger operators, we generalise the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum inequality to complex potentials and derive new Lieb--Thirring type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Complete asymptotics in the formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three categories of mathematical results concerning quiescent big bang singularities: the derivation of asymptotics in a symmetry class; the construction of spacetimes given initial data on the singularity; and the proof of big bang formation in the absence of symmetries, including the proof of stable big bang formation. In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity. However, the results are more general and can potentially be used to derive similar conclusions in other gauges.</description>

      <title>Resolving problems with the continuum limit in coherent-state path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper solves the problem of continuum limit in bosonic thermal coherent-state path integrals. For this purpose, exact discrete versions of the path integral are constructed for three different orderings of the Hamiltonian: normal, anti-normal and symmetric (Weyl order). Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators).</description>

      <title>Mellin-type Functional Integrals with Applications to Quantum Field Theory and Number Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1501.01889v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional functional/path integrals used in physics are most often defined and understood, either explicitly or implicitly, as the infinite-dimensional analog of Fourier transform. In this paper, the infinite-dimensional analog of Mellin transform is defined and developed. The associated functional integrals are useful tools for probing non-commutative function spaces in general and $C^\ast$-algebras in particular. Functional Mellin transforms are used to define the functional analogs of resolvents, complex powers, traces, logarithms, and determinants. Several aspects of these objects are examined and applied to various constructs in mathematical physics. As substantial applications, we construct Mellin-based QFT generating functionals for bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, explore connections between functional complex powers and scattering amplitudes, interpret renormalization from a functional Mellin perspective, define a parameter-dependent entropy that formally justifies the replica trick, and explore $L$-functions associated with functional traces and determinants.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Solutions of the Haydys-Witten Equations and Symplectic Khovanov Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An influential conjecture by Witten states that there is an instanton Floer homology of four-manifolds with corners that in certain situations is isomorphic to Khovanov homology of a given knot $K$. The Floer chain complex is generated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular behaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$. The Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an additional flow direction $\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions of a decoupled version of the Haydys-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}_s \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to the full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed as a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five dimensions. Inspired by Gaiotto-Witten's approach of adiabatically braiding EBE-solutions to obtain generators of the Floer homology, we propose that there is an equivalence between adiabatic solutions of the decoupled Haydys-Witten equations and non-vertical paths in the moduli space of EBE-solutions fibered over the space of monopole positions. Moreover, we argue that the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the Lie algebra of the gauge group provides a finite-dimensional model of this moduli space of monopole solutions. These considerations suggest an intriguing similarity between Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology and symplectic Khovanov homology and provide a novel approach towards a proof of Witten's gauge-theoretic interpretations of Khovanov homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</description>

Abstract: The rigorous tools of convex analysis are used to examine various serial and parallel combinations of linear viscosity and perfect plasticity. Nonlinear viscosities are also considered. The general aim is to synthesize a single convex ``viscoplastic'' dissipation potential from the potentials of particular viscous or plastic elements. Rigorous serial-viscosity models are then compared with empirical models based on harmonic means, which are commonly used for various geomaterials.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a compactification construction for abstract quasi-local C*-algebras over countable metric spaces equipped with an isometric group action which is functorial with respect to bounded spread isomorphisms. In $1$D, the construction recovers Ocneanu's Tube algebra for fusion spin chains, and provides a canonical bridge between infinite-volume observables and observables with periodic boundary conditions. We exploit this connection to derive an obstruction for the implementability of such topological symmetries as Kramers-Wannier type dualities on symmetric subalgebras.</description>

Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

Abstract: For simple Lie algebras we construct characteristic identities for split (polarized) Casimir operators in representations $T \otimes Y_n$ and $T \otimes Y_n'$, where $T$ -- defining (minimal fundamental for exceptional Lie algebras) representation, $Y_n$ -- n-Cartan powers of the adjoint representations $ad = Y_1$ and Y_n' -- special representations appeared in the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of symmetric part of $ad^{\otimes n}$. By means of these characteristic identities, we derive (for all simple Lie algebras, except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) explicit formulae for invariant projectors onto irreducible subrepresentations arose in the decomposition of $T \otimes Y_n$. These projectors and characteristic identities are written in the universal form for all simple Lie algebras (except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) in terms of Vogel parameters. Universal formulas for the dimensions of the Casimir subrepresentations appeared in the decompositions of $T \otimes Y_n$ where found.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: M.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N.~Nadirashvili [Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48] and T.~Hoff\-mann-Ostenhof, P.~Michor, and N.~Nadirashvili [Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188]. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In the first paper, $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the second, $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in these papers are not very detailed. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. We provide a survey of previous results (Chap.~1), as well as proofs of prerequisite theorems (Chap.~2). When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof of the upper bound, $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some eigenfunctions (Chap.~3). When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider the three boundary conditions, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains. More precisely, we prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$ (Chap.~4). We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected (Chap.~5). These chapters rely on Euler's inequality applied to the nodal graph and a careful analysis of eigenfunctions which optimize Euler's inequality. Chap.~6 contains related results (nodal line conjecture; Courant-sharp eigenvalues).</description>

      <title>Stability of the expanding region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Energy from topology and chiral spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the existence of a massless spinor with respect to the total connection in a spacetime modeled as a Lorentzian manifold with internal boundaries, such as finite volume semi-classical Black Holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as General Relativity with dark energy. This may alleviate the problems of dark energy. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.</description>

      <title>A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>A 3D lattice defect and efficient computations in topological MBQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of self-dual $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb T^4$ of topological charge $Q = r/N$, $1 \leq r \leq N-1$, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$, the agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned $\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs, their tensor products, and their strongly-rational cosets. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that $U$ is strongly local. Let $\mathcal A_V,\mathcal A_U$ be the conformal nets associated to $V,U$ in the sense of Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner (CKLW). We prove that $\mathcal A_U$ is canonically isomorphic to the conformal net extension of $\mathcal A_V$ defined by the Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that all unitary $U$-modules are strongly integrable in the sense of Carpi-Weiner-Xu (CWX). We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$-category of unitary $U$-modules to the $C^*$-category of finite-index $\mathcal A_U$-modules is naturally isomorphic to $*$-functor defined by $Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum field theory for a scalar model of the electromagnetic field interacting with a system of two-level atoms. In this setting, we show that it is possible to uniquely determine the density of atoms from measurements of the source to solution map for a system of nonlocal partial differential equations, which describe the scattering of a two-photon state from the atoms. The required measurements involve correlating the outputs of a point detector with an integrating detector, thereby exploiting information about the entanglement of the photons.</description>

      <title>Retraction Dynamics of a Highly Viscous Liquid Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional capillary-driven retraction of a finite, planar liquid sheet in the asymptotic regime where both the Ohnesorge number $\mathrm{Oh}$ and the initial length-to-thickness ratio $l_0/h_0$ are large. In this regime, the fluid domain decomposes into two regions: a thin-film region governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum equations, and a small tip region near the free edge described by a self-similar Stokes flow. Asymptotic matching between these regions yields an effective boundary condition for the thin-film region, representing a balance between viscous and capillary forces at the free edge. Surface tension drives the thin-film flow only through this boundary condition, while the local momentum balance is dominated by viscous and inertial stresses. We show that the thin-film flow possesses a conserved quantity, reducing the equation of thickness to heat equation with time-dependent boundary conditions. The reduced problem depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{L} = l_0 / (4 h_0 \mathrm{Oh})$. Numerical solutions of the reduced model agree well with previous studies and reveal that the sheet undergoes distinct retraction regimes depending on $\mathcal{L}$ and a dimensionless time after rupture $T$. We derive asymptotic approximations for the thickness profile, velocity profile, and retraction speed during the early and late stages of retraction. At early times, the retraction speed grows as $T^{1/2}$, while at late times it decays as $1/T^2$. An intermediate regime arises for very long sheets ($\mathcal{L} \gg 1$). During this phase, the retraction speed approaches the Taylor-Culick value. When $T \approx \mathcal{L}$, the speed undergoes fast deceleration from the Taylor-Culick speed to late-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Approximation of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta$-interactions supported on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the approximation of a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a singular $\delta$-potential that is formally given by $(i \nabla + A)^2 + Q + \alpha \delta_\Sigma$ by Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials in the norm resolvent sense. This is done for $\Sigma$ being the finite union of $C^2$-hypersurfaces, for coefficients $A$, $Q$, and $\alpha$ under almost minimal assumptions such that the associated quadratic forms are closed and sectorial, and $Q$ and $\alpha$ are allowed to be complex-valued functions. In particular, $\Sigma$ can be a graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the boundary of a piecewise $C^2$-domain. Moreover, spectral implications of the mentioned convergence result are discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a single conservation law in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for translationally invariant quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Blowup driven by critical balance in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a phase-parametrized differential approximation kinetic model (N-DAM), inspired by the physics of deep water surface gravity waves and recently obtained using large-$N$ summation techniques under a local approximation in wavenumber space. Previous work showed that the model admits steady-state solutions interpolating between the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-4}$ and either a strong-turbulence regime $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-2}$ or the Phillips critical-balance spectrum $E(\omega) \propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales. These solutions reproduce scaling regimes expected in gravity-wave kinetics, suggesting that the N-DAM may serve as an effective augmented version of an earlier differential approximation model introduced by Hasselmann. Here we investigate finite-time blowup in the N-DAM and show that it is generically governed by the critical-balance regime. This leads to a non-Kolmogorov finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of the parameter $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup dynamics from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above a critical value $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a discretely self-similar blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <title>Backbone probability of planar Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by critical planar percolation, we investigate a ``backbone'' event of planar Brownian motion, i.e.~the existence of two disjoint subpaths on the Brownian trajectory connecting the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the starting point to a macroscopic distance. We show that the probability of this event is $C(\log|\log\varepsilon|)^{-1}(1+o(1))$ as $\varepsilon\to0$ for some constant $C\in(0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on the Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) in its left-, right-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under the corresponding class of diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behaviour under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other well-known setups, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. In particular, physical vacuum, characterized by a moving boundary with nontrivial finite normal acceleration, naturally arises in the motion of shallow water. The corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows remain open, due to the combined difficulties of coordinate singularity at the origin and degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. For a general class of spherically symmetric initial densities: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent), vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. We note that, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, $\rho_0$ contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$, precluding the use of the BD entropy estimate to handle the degeneracy of the shallow water equations ({\it i.e.}, the case $\gamma=2$) on the physical vacuum boundary. Our analysis relies on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, leading to flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; near the boundary, to handle the physical vacuum singularity, we introduce novel $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which are fundamentally different from the classical BD entropy estimate. Together, these estimates yield the desired global regularities.</description>

      <title>The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.</description>
