      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order in an axion insulator candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$ investigated by NMR measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators exhibit unique electronic states due to the interplay between the electronic topology and the spin structure. The antiferromagnetic metal $\rm{EuIn_2As_2}$ is a prominent candidate material in which exotic topological phases, including an axion insulating state, are theoretically predicted depending on the magnetic structure of the $\rm{Eu}^{2+}$ moments. Here, we report experimental results of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of all the nuclei in $\rm{EuIn_2As_2}$ to investigate the coupling between the magnetic moments in the Eu ions and the conduction electrons in $\rm{In_2As_2}$ layers and the magnetic structure. The $^{75}\rm{As}$ and $^{115}\rm{In}$ NMR spectra observed at zero external magnetic field reveal the appearance of internal fields of $4.9$ and $3.6\ \rm{T}$ respectively at the lowest temperature, suggesting a strong coupling between the conduction electrons in the $\rm{In_2As_2}$ layer and the ordered magnetic moments in the Eu ions. The $^{75}\rm{As}$ NMR spectra under in-plane external magnetic fields show broad distributions of the internal fields produced by an incommensurate fan-like spin structure which turns into a forced ferromagnetic state above $0.7\ \rm{T}$. We propose a spin reorientation process that an incommensurate helical state at zero external magnetic field quickly changes into a fan state by applying a slight magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Structural transition, spontaneous formation of strong singlet dimers and metamagnetism in $S=3/2$ magnetoelastic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic-elastic model with magnetic ions having spin $S=3/2$. By extensive DMRG computations and complementary analytical methods, we uncover a first-order transition from a homogeneous or weakly-dimerized phase (a situation that could be similar to the well known $S=1/2$ spin-Peierls effect) to a highly distorted phase, driven by the spin-phonon coupling $\lambda$. The striking characteristic of the second phase, present at large $\lambda$, is the appearance of weakly ferromagnetic (FM) couplings alternating with strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones (we dub it FM-AFM phase) with a ground state close to a direct-product state of singlet dimers sitting on the AFM bonds. The behavior of the spin gap in both phases is studied by DMRG computation and contrasted with bosonization predictions and perturbation theory around the direct product of dimers. In the FM-AFM phase robust magnetization plateaus and metamagnetic jumps show under magnetic fields.
  The novel phase could be realized in 5d oxides of current interest, with giant spin-phonon coupling. Potential applications of the transition would be associated to the possibility of tuning the transition by external parameters such as striction, magnetic or electric fields, or alloying.</description>

      <title>Observation of Phonon Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum (AM), a fundamental concept describing the rotation of an object about an axis, profoundly influences all branches of physics. In condensed matter, AM is intimately related to the emergence of topological quantum states, including chiral superconductivity and quantum spin liquids, and various chiral quasiparticles. Recently, it has been predicted that microscopic lattice excitations, known as phonons, can carry finite AM with remarkable macroscopic physical consequences. However, the direct observation of phonon-AM has not been achieved. In this letter, we report the experimental discovery of phonon-AM in the chiral crystal Tellurium. We show that due to AM conservation, applying a time-reversal symmetry breaking thermal gradient along the chiral axis of single crystal Te results in a macroscopic mechanical torque, $\tau$, that can be observed using a cantilever-based device. We establish that the mechanical torques change sign by flipping the thermal gradient and disappear in polycrystalline samples that lack a preferred chirality. Based on our experimental settings, we estimate $\tau\sim10^{-11}$N$\cdot$m, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our results uncover phonon-AM and pave the way for phonon-AM enabled quantum states for microelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Energy Driven Ferromagnetic Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a minimal model of interacting fermions establishing a ferromagnetic insulating phase. It is based on the Hubbard model on a trimerized triangular lattice in the regime of $U\gg t\gg |t^\prime|$ with $t&gt;0$ and $t^\prime$ the intra- and inter-trimer hopping amplitudes, respectively. At the $\frac{1}{3}$-filling, each trimer becomes a triplet spin-1 moment, and the inter-trimer superexchange is ferromagnetic with $J =- \frac{2}{27}\frac{t^{\prime 2}}{t}$ in the limit of $U/t=+\infty$. As $U/t$ becomes finite, the antiferromagnetic superexchange competes with the ferromagnetic one. The system enters into a frustrated antiferromagnetic insulator when $\lambda&gt;U/t\gg 1$ where $\lambda \sim 10$. In contrast, a similar analysis performed on the trimerized Kagome lattice shows that only antiferromagnetic superchange exits at 1/3-filling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic and transport properties of GdSbSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detailed investigation of the magnetic, transport, and magnetocaloric effects of GdSbSe by magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$, isothermal magnetization $M(H)$, resistivity $\rho(T, H)$, and heat capacity $C_p(T)$ measurements, crystallizing in the ZrSiS-type tetragonal crystal system with space group $P4/nmm$. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed long-range antiferromagnetic ordering with two additional magnetic anomalies below N\'eel temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 8.6 K), corroborated through magnetocaloric and specific heat studies. Isothermal magnetization measurements unveil hidden metamagnetic signatures through a clear deviation from linearity. In addition, the enhanced value of the Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma$ = 152(5) mJ/ mol K$^2$) suggests strong electronic correlations in GdSbSe. The entropy of magnetization derived from magnetic isotherms unfolds the field-induced transition from Inverse magnetocaloric Effect (IMCE) to Conventional MCE. The detailed transport properties indicate a semimetallic behavior, strongly coupled with magnetic order. Deviations from Kohler's rule and non-linear Hall resistivity anticipate the possibility of Dirac-like dispersion with non-trivial characteristics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of Phonon Instabilities in Symmetry Group 191 Kagome MT$_6$Z$_6$ Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials manifest rich physical properties due to the emergence of abundant electronic phases. Here, we carry out a high-throughput first-principles study of the kagome 1:6:6 family MT$_6$Z$_6$ materials in space group 191, focusing on their phonon instability and electronic flat bands. Different MT$_6$Z$_6$ kagome candidates reveal a remarkable variety of kagome flat bands ranging from unfilled, partially filled, to fully filled. Notably, the Mn/Fe-166 compounds exhibit partially filled flat bands with a pronounced sharp peak in the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to magnetic orders that polarize the bands and stabilize the otherwise unstable phonon. When the flat bands are located away from the Fermi level, we find a large number of phonon instabilities, which can be classified into three types, based on the phonon dispersion and vibrational modes. Type-I instabilities involve the in-plane distortion of kagome nets, while type-II and type-III present out-of-plane distortion of trigonal M and Z atoms. We take MgNi$_6$Ge$_6$ and HfNi$_6$In$_6$ as examples to illustrate the possible CDW structures derived from the emergent type-I and type-II instabilities. The type-I instability in MgNi$_6$Ge$_6$ suggests a nematic phase transition, governed by the local twisting of kagome nets. The type-II instability in HfNi$_6$In$_6$ may result in a hexagonal-to-orthorhombic transition, offering insight into the formation of MT$_6$Z$_6$ in other space groups. Additionally, the predicted ScNb$_6$Sn$_6$ is analyzed as an example of the type-III instability. Our predictions suggest a vast kagome family with rich properties induced by the flat bands, possible CDW transitions, and their interplay with magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated accomplishments of modern physics is the description of fundamental principles of nature in the language of geometry. As the motion of celestial bodies is governed by the geometry of spacetime, the motion of electrons in condensed matter can be characterized by the geometry of the Hilbert space of their wave functions. Such quantum geometry, comprising of Berry curvature and quantum metric, can thus exert profound influences on various properties of materials. The dipoles of both Berry curvature and quantum metric produce nonlinear transport. The quantum metric plays an important role in flat-band superconductors by enhancing the transition temperature. The uniformly distributed momentum-space quantum geometry stabilizes the fractional Chern insulators and results in the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. We here review in detail quantum geometry in condensed matter, paying close attention to its effects on nonlinear transport, superconductivity, and topological properties. Possible future research directions in this field are also envisaged.</description>

      <title>Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model of Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_4$ transitions in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nature of quantum phase transitions out of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ ordered phases in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder. We report very rich critical behavior that includes a pair of Ising transitions, a multi-critical Ashkin-Teller point and a remarkably extended interval of a chiral transition. Although plaquette states turn out to be essential to realize chiral transitions, we demonstrate that critical regimes can be manipulated by deforming the model as to increase the presence of leg-dimerized states. This can be done to the point where the chiral transition turns into first order, we argue that this is associated with the emergence of a critical end point.</description>

      <title>Orbital antiferromagnetic currents in a frustrated fermionic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spinless $t$-$t'$ ionic Hubbard chain at 1/2 filling and large hopping ratio $t'/t$. In this limit the model adequately maps onto a weakly coupled triangular ladder with a potential interchain bias. The low-energy properties of the system are formed due to the interplay of geometrical frustration, correlations and charge imbalance. We derive the effective field-theoretical model to study universal properties of the model in the scaling limit. We show that at full dynamical frustration the ground state of the ladder represents a repulsive version of the Luther-Emery liquid with dominant orbital antiferromagnetic correlations exhibiting the slowest power-law decay in the ground state. Pairing correlations also display algebraic order but are subdominant. At an incomplete dynamical frustration a finite commensurability gap is dynamically generated, and the fluctuating OAF transforms to a long-range ordered state with a spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry. The mass gap in the spectrum of relative density fluctuations gets suppressed upon increasing the potential bias.</description>

      <title>Krylov Delocalization/Localization across Ergodicity Breaking</title>

Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the phenomenology of inverse localization length on the Krylov chain that undergoes delocalization/localization transition on the Krylov chain while the physical system undergoes ergodicity breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different operators in the ergodic regime. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <title>Electronic Excitations in the Bulk of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze electronic excitations (excitations generated by adding or removing one electron) in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall states in Jain sequence states, using composite fermion Chern-Simons field theory. Starting from meanfield approximation in which gauge field fluctuations are neglected, we use symmetry to constrain the possible composite fermion states contributing to electronic Green's function and expect discrete infinitely-sharp peaks in the electronic spectral function. We further consider the electronic excitations in particle-hole conjugate fractional quantum hall states. Gauge field fluctuations play an increasingly important role in the electron spectral function as the filling factor approaches 1/2, and evolve the discrete coherent peaks into a broad continuum even in the absence of impurities. At that limit, we switch to the electron perspective and calculate the electron spectral function via linked cluster approximation from the low to intermediate energy range. Finally, we compare our results with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Excitons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb-driven bound states of electrons and holes, are typically composed of integer charges. However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge fractionalization, a more exotic form of interlayer exciton can emerge, where pairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite numerous theoretical predictions for such fractional excitons, their experimental observation has remained elusive. Here, we report transport signatures of excitonic pairing within fractional quantum Hall effect states. By probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying wavefunction, we uncover two novel quantum phases of matter. One of these orders can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at a total filling of one, while the other involves a more unusual type of exciton that obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard paradigm of bosonic excitons.</description>

      <title>Accurate DFT Simulation of Complex Functional Materials: Synergistic Enhancements Achieved by SCAN meta-GGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex functional materials are characterized by intricate and competing bond orders, making them an excellent platform for evaluating the newly developed Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of SCAN in simulating the electronic properties of displacive ferroelectrics (BaTiO3 and PbTiO3) and magnetoelectric multiferroics (BiFeO3 and YMnO3), which encompass a broad spectrum of bonding characteristics. Due to a significant reduction in self-interaction error, SCAN manifests its improvements over the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method in three aspects: SCAN produces more compact orbitals, predicts more accurate ionicity, and better captures orbital anisotropy. Particularly, these synergistic enhancements lead to notable phenomena in calculating the bandgap of YMnO3: while the PBE+U simulation may suggest a strong correlation appearance attributed to high Hubbard-like U values (~5 eV), the value is dramatically lower (~1 eV) in the SCAN+U method. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive analysis of SCAN's operational principles by examining the complex electron densities involved. These insights are theoretically intriguing and have practical implications, potentially encouraging wider adoption of SCAN in the computational modeling of complex functional materials.</description>
