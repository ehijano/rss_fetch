      <title>Smartphone-integrated RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a Detection System with Microneedle Sampling for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Potato Late Blight in Early Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history. Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P. infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P. sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P. infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease detection and control in the field.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Correlated Mutation Type Probabilities for Mutational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Somatic mutations, or alterations in DNA of a somatic cell, are key markers of cancer. In recent years, mutational signature analysis has become a prominent field of study within cancer research, commonly with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Bayesian NMF. However, current methods assume independence across mutation types in the signatures matrix. This paper expands upon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account for the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the Bayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the signatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external information, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This model converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with independent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and results in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In addition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure of the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving the algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the dependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of biological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer. The code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package. Our work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency structure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable to any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Information Flow by Dual Reporter System and Its Application to Bacterial Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here, we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>Geometric deep learning assists protein engineering. Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein engineering is experiencing a paradigmatic shift through the integration of geometric deep learning into computational design workflows. While traditional strategies, such as rational design and directed evolution, have enabled relevant advances, they remain limited by the complexity of sequence space and the cost of experimental validation. Geometric deep learning addresses these limitations by operating on non-Euclidean domains, capturing spatial, topological, and physicochemical features essential to protein function. This perspective outlines the current applications of GDL across stability prediction, functional annotation, molecular interaction modeling, and de novo protein design. We highlight recent methodological advances in model generalization, interpretability, and robustness, particularly under data-scarce conditions. A unified framework is proposed that integrates GDL with explainable AI and structure-based validation to support transparent, autonomous design. As GDL converges with generative modeling and high-throughput experimentation, it is emerging as a central technology in next-generation protein engineering and synthetic biology.</description>

      <title>SHREC and PHEONA: Using Large Language Models to Advance Next-Generation Computational Phenotyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications. However, it is time-intensive because of manual data review, limited automation, and difficulties in adapting algorithms across sources. Since LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and generation, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks traditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation computational phenotyping methods, we developed SHREC, a framework for comprehensive integration of LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines. Materials and Methods: We applied and tested the ability of three lightweight LLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to classify concepts and phenotype patients using previously developed phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. Results: All models performed well on concept classification, with the best model (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of 0.896 across all relevant concepts. For phenotyping, models demonstrated near-perfect specificity for all phenotypes, and the top-performing model (Mistral) reached an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes, despite lower performance on multi-therapy phenotypes. Discussion: There are several advantages of LLMs that support their application to computational phenotyping, such as their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt engineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps to advance next-generation phenotyping methods include determining optimal strategies for integrating biomedical data, exploring how LLMs reason, and advancing generative model methods. Conclusion: Current lightweight LLMs can feasibly assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks such as manual data review.</description>

      <title>EHCube4P: Learning Epistatic Patterns Through Hypercube Graph Convolution Neural Network for Protein Fitness Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between protein sequences and their functions is fundamental to protein engineering, but this task is hindered by the combinatorially vast sequence space and the experimental noise inherent in fitness measurements. In this study, we present a novel framework that models the sequence landscape as a hypercube $H(k,2)$ and integrates wavelet-based signal denoising with a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict protein fitness across rugged fitness landscapes. Using a dataset of 419 experimentally measured mutant sequences of the Tobacco 5-Epi-Aristolochene Synthase (TEAS) enzyme, we preprocess the fitness signals using a 1-D discrete wavelet transform with a Daubechies-3 basis to suppress experimental noise while preserving local epistatic patterns. Our model comprises two GCN layers, allowing for beyond pairwise aggregation, followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We show that our approach, EHCube4P, generalizes well across different enzyme activity datasets and effectively captures higher-order mutational interactions. Performance varies with the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, with smoother signals yielding higher test set $r^2$ scores. These results demonstrate that combining wavelet preprocessing with graph-based deep learning enhances the robustness and generalization of fitness prediction, particularly for sparse and noisy biological datasets. The approach provides a scalable and interpretable framework for protein fitness estimation applicable to a broad range of combinatorial biological systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>CINNAMON: A hybrid approach to change point detection and parameter estimation in single-particle tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Change point detection has become an important part of the analysis of the single-particle tracking data, as it allows one to identify moments, in which the motion patterns of observed particles undergo significant changes. The segmentation of diffusive trajectories based on those moments may provide insight into various phenomena in soft condensed matter and biological physics. In this paper, we propose CINNAMON, a hybrid approach to classifying single-particle tracking trajectories, detecting change points within them, and estimating diffusion parameters in the segments between the change points. Our method is based on a combination of neural networks, feature-based machine learning, and statistical techniques. It has been benchmarked in the second Anomalous Diffusion Challenge. The method offers a high level of interpretability due to its analytical and feature-based components. A potential use of features from topological data analysis is also discussed.</description>

      <title>DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 14.69%, 22.52%, and 13.03% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.</description>

      <title>EchoNet-Quality: Denoising Echocardiograms via Deep Generative Modeling of Ultrasound Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Echocardiography (echo), or cardiac ultrasound, is the most widely used imaging modality for cardiac form and function due to its relatively low cost, rapid acquisition time, and non-invasive nature. However, ultrasound acquisitions are often limited by artifacts and noise that hinder diagnostic interpretation in clinical settings. Existing methodologies for denoising echos consist solely of traditional filtering-based algorithms or deep learning methods developed on radio-frequency (RF) signals which prevents clinical applicability and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce the first deep generative model capable of simulating ultrasound noise developed on B-mode data. Using this generative model, we develop a synthetic dataset of paired clean and noisy echo images to train a downstream model for real-world image denoising and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both internal and external experiments. In both held-out test sets, our method results in echo images with higher gCNR in comparison to noisy image counterparts and images derived from a comparable method which is consistent with provided visual comparisons. Our experiments showcase the potential of our method for future clinical use to improve the quality of echo acquisitions. To encourage further research into the field, we release our source code and model weights at https://github.com/echonet/image_quality.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and prediction of microglial cell dynamics in the ischemic penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the tissue surrounding the irreversibly injured infarct core, referred to as the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two distinct phenotypes; however, the dynamics between the detrimental M1 phenotype and beneficial M2 phenotype are not fully understood. Using phenotype-specific cell count data obtained from experimental studies on middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke in mice, we employ sparsity-promoting system identification techniques combined with Bayesian statistical methods for uncertainty quantification to generate continuous and discrete-time predictive models of the M1 and M2 microglial cell dynamics. The resulting data-driven models include constant and linear terms but do not include nonlinear interactions between the cells. Results emphasize an initial M2 dominance followed by a takeover of M1 cells, capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells, and suggest a persistent inflammatory response.</description>

      <title>Integrating Dynamical Systems Learning with Foundational Models: A Meta-Evolutionary AI Framework for Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.</description>
