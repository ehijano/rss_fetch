      <title>Reinforcement Learning Pair Trading: A Dynamic Scaling approach</title>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency is a cryptography-based digital asset with extremely volatile prices. Around $70 billion worth of crypto-currency is traded daily on exchanges. Trading crypto-currency is difficult due to the inherent volatility of the crypto-market. In this work, we want to test the hypothesis: "Can techniques from artificial intelligence help with algorithmically trading cryptocurrencies?". In order to address this question, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with pair trading. Pair trading is a statistical arbitrage trading technique which exploits the price difference between statistically correlated assets. We train reinforcement learners to determine when and how to trade pairs of cryptocurrencies. We develop new reward shaping and observation/action spaces for reinforcement learning. We performed experiments with the developed reinforcement learner on pairs of BTC-GBP and BTC-EUR data separated by 1-minute intervals (n = 263,520). The traditional non-RL pair trading technique achieved an annualised profit of 8.33%, while the proposed RL-based pair trading technique achieved annualised profits from 9.94% - 31.53%, depending upon the RL learner. Our results show that RL can significantly outperform manual and traditional pair trading techniques when applied to volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>The Negative Drift of a Limit Order Fill</title>

Abstract: Market making refers to a form of trading in financial markets characterized by passive orders which add liquidity to limit order books. Market makers are important for the proper functioning of financial markets worldwide. Given the importance, financial mathematics has endeavored to derive optimal strategies for placing limit orders in this context. This paper identifies a key discrepancy between popular model assumptions and the realities of real markets, specifically regarding the dynamics around limit order fills. Traditionally, market making models rely on an assumption of low-cost random fills, when in reality we observe a high-cost non-random fill behavior. Namely, limit order fills are caused by and coincide with adverse price movements, which create a drag on the market maker's profit and loss. We refer to this phenomenon as "the negative drift" associated with limit order fills. We describe a discrete market model and prove theoretically that the negative drift exists. We also provide a detailed empirical simulation using one of the most traded financial instruments in the world, the 10 Year US Treasury Bond futures, which also confirms its existence. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe and prove this phenomenon in such detail.</description>

Abstract: Volume imbalance in a limit order book is often considered as a reliable indicator for predicting future price moves. In this work, we seek to analyse the nuances of the relationship between prices and volume imbalance. To this end, we study a market-making problem which allows us to view the imbalance as an optimal response to price moves. In our model, there is an underlying efficient price driving the mid-price, which follows the model with uncertainty zones. A single market maker knows the underlying efficient price and consequently the probability of a mid-price jump in the future. She controls the volumes she quotes at the best bid and ask prices. Solving her optimization problem allows us to understand endogenously the price-imbalance connection and to confirm in particular that it is optimal to quote a predictive imbalance. Our model can also be used by a platform to select a suitable tick size, which is known to be a crucial topic in financial regulation. The value function of the market maker's control problem can be viewed as a family of functions, indexed by the level of the market maker's inventory, solving a coupled system of PDEs. We show existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to this coupled system of equations. In the case of a continuous inventory, we also prove uniqueness of the market maker's optimal control policy.</description>
