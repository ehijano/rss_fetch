      <title>Blackwell without Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully prior-free model of experimentation in which the decision maker observes the entire distribution of signals generated by a known experiment under an unknown distribution of the state of the world. One experiment is robustly more informative than another if the decision maker's maxmin expected utility after observing the output of the former is always at least her maxmin expected utility after observing the latter. We show that this ranking holds if and only if the less informative experiment is a linear transformation of the more informative experiment; equivalently, the null space of the more informative experiment is a subset of the null space of the less informative experiment. Our criterion is implied by Blackwell's order but does not imply it, and we show by example that our ranking admits strictly more comparable pairs of experiments than the classical ranking.</description>

      <title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as a Generalisation of Condorcet's Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is a seminal result of Social Choice Theory that demonstrates the impossibility of ranked-choice decision-making processes to jointly satisfy a number of intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints. The theorem is often described as a generalisation of Condorcet's Paradox, wherein pairwise majority voting may fail to jointly satisfy the same constraints due to the occurrence of elections that result in contradictory preference cycles. However, a formal proof of this relationship has been limited to D'Antoni's work, which applies only to the strict preference case, i.e., where indifference between alternatives is not allowed. In this paper, we generalise D'Antoni's methodology to prove in full (i.e., accounting for weak preferences) that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem can be equivalently stated in terms of contradictory preference cycles. This methodology involves explicitly constructing profiles that lead to preference cycles. Using this framework, we also prove a number of additional facts regarding social welfare functions. As a result, this methodology may yield further insights into the nature of preference cycles in other domains e.g., Money Pumps, Dutch Books, Intransitive Games, etc.</description>

      <title>Ranking Policies Under Loss Aversion and Inequality Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong empirical evidence from laboratory experiments, and more recently from population surveys, shows that individuals, when evaluating their situations, pay attention to whether they experience gains or losses, with losses weighing more heavily than gains. The electorate's loss aversion, in turn, influences politicians' choices. We propose a new framework for welfare analysis of policy outcomes that, in addition to the traditional focus on post-policy incomes, also accounts for individuals' gains and losses resulting from policies. We develop several bivariate stochastic dominance criteria for ranking policy outcomes that are sensitive to features of the joint distribution of individuals' income changes and absolute incomes. The main social objective assumes that individuals are loss averse with respect to income gains and losses, inequality averse with respect to absolute incomes, and hold varying preferences regarding the association between incomes and income changes. We translate these and other preferences into functional inequalities that can be tested using sample data. The concepts and methods are illustrated using data from an income support experiment conducted in Connecticut.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Charitable Donations with Leontief Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of funding public goods that are complementary in nature. Examples include charities handling different needs (e.g., protecting animals vs. providing healthcare), charitable donations to different individuals, or municipal units handling different issues (e.g., security vs. transportation). We model these complementarities by assuming Leontief preferences; that is, each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities. Decentralized funding may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination among the donors; centralized funding may be undesirable as it ignores the preferences of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods. The mechanism efficiently distributes each donor's contribution so that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, and can be implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Trade-off Between Minimal Instability and Larger Improvements over Deferred Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance mechanism (EADA) improves the efficiency of the DA algorithm via consented priority violations. Notwithstanding its many merits, we show that EADA can improve only two students when an alternative mechanism that Pareto-dominates DA could benefit all but one student. This shortfall in the number of students improved is not exclusive of EADA but extends to all setwise minimally unstable mechanisms, i.e. those that generate a set of blocking pairs that is never a strict superset of that of another mechanism. The incompatibility between number of students improved and minimal instability disappears when blocking pairs are compared cardinally rather than by set inclusion. In some problems, EADA can be doubly dominated: improving fewer students while generating more blocking pairs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Taxation under Imperfect Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal taxation when the conversion of tax revenue into public goods is uncertain. In a static Ramsey framework with a representative household, a competitive firm, and two broad instruments (a labor-income tax and a commodity/output tax), a simple measure of trust - the perceived likelihood that revenue is actually delivered as public consumption - scales the marginal value of public funds. We show: (i) a trust threshold below which any distortionary taxation reduces welfare; (ii) above that threshold, policy uniquely pins down the scale of taxation but leaves a continuum of tax mixes (an equivalence frontier) that implement the same allocation and welfare; and (iii) tiny administrative or salience wedges select a unique instrument, typically favoring a broad base collected at source. We derive a trust-adjusted Ramsey rule in sufficient-statistics form, establish robustness to mild preference non-separabilities and concave public-good utility, and provide an isoelastic specialization with transparent comparative statics.</description>

      <title>Credible Scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multidimensional cheap talk with simple language and aligned preferences. An expert communicates with a decision-maker using a score that aggregates a multidimensional state into a one-dimensional message. Expert and decision-maker share the same quadratic-loss utility function. We show that the use of simple language introduces strategic considerations. First, equilibrium payoffs may be lower than those achievable under commitment to a score. Additionally, any equilibrium score must be either linear or discrete. Finally, for normally distributed states, the set of equilibrium linear scores includes only the ex-ante best and worst linear scores.</description>

      <title>Networked Information Aggregation via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve \emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all} features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access. We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical results with a comprehensive set of experiments.</description>
