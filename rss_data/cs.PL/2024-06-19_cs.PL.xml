      <title>Data Petri Nets meet Probabilistic Programming (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming (PP) is a programming paradigm that allows for writing statistical models like ordinary programs, performing simulations by running those programs, and analyzing and refining their statistical behavior using powerful inference engines. This paper takes a step towards leveraging PP for reasoning about data-aware processes. To this end, we present a systematic translation of Data Petri Nets (DPNs) into a model written in a PP language whose features are supported by most PP systems. We show that our translation is sound and provides statistical guarantees for simulating DPNs. Furthermore, we discuss how PP can be used for process mining tasks and report on a prototype implementation of our translation. We also discuss further analysis scenarios that could be easily approached based on the proposed translation and available PP tools.</description>

      <title>Iterative or Innovative? A Problem-Oriented Perspective for Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving a wide range of programming tasks. However, LLMs have rarely been explored for code optimization. In this paper, we explore code optimization with a focus on performance enhancement, specifically aiming to optimize code for minimal execution time. The recently proposed first PIE dataset for performance optimization constructs program optimization pairs based on iterative submissions from the same programmer for the same problem. However, this approach restricts LLMs to local performance improvements, neglecting global algorithmic innovation. Therefore, we adopt a completely different perspective by reconstructing the optimization pairs into a problem-oriented approach. This allows for the integration of various ingenious ideas from different programmers tackling the same problem. Experimental results demonstrate that adapting LLMs to problem-oriented optimization pairs significantly enhances their optimization capabilities. Meanwhile, we identified performance bottlenecks within the problem-oriented perspective. By employing model merge, we further overcame bottlenecks and ultimately elevated the program optimization ratio ($51.76\%\rightarrow76.65\%$) and speedup ($2.65\times\rightarrow5.09\times$) to new levels.</description>
