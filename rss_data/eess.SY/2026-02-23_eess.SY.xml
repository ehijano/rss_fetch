      <title>Modal Energy for Power System Analysis: Definitions and Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal energy provides information complementary to and based on conventional eigenvalues and participation factors for power system modal analysis. However, modal energy definition is not unique. This letter clarifies the definitions and applicability of mainstream modal energy approaches, focusing on their mappings to eigenvalues and to the total system energy. It is shown that these mappings hold only under restrictive conditions, notably system normality, which limits their applicability in inverter-dominated power systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces enable active control of wireless propagation channels, which is crucial for future 5G and 6G networks. This work presents a scalable RIS design operating at 3.6 GHz with both 1 bit and 3 bit phase resolution, supporting wideband applications. The unit cells employ low-cost printed circuit board technology with an innovative spring-contact feeding structure, enabling efficient assembly and reduced manufacturing complexity for large-area arrays. The design achieves broadband phase control, low power consumption, and high scalability, with experimental results demonstrating phase tunability across the n78 frequency band and competitive reflection performance compared to existing solutions. This RIS architecture provides a practical platform for experimental studies of smart radio environments, beam steering, and sensing applications in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Decision Support under Prediction-Induced Censoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many data-driven online decision systems, actions determine not only operational costs but also the data availability for future learning -- a phenomenon termed Prediction-Induced Censoring (PIC). This challenge is particularly acute in large-scale resource allocation for generative AI (GenAI) serving: insufficient capacity triggers shortages but hides the true demand, leaving the system with only a "greater-than" constraint. Standard decision-making approaches that rely on uncensored data suffer from selection bias, often locking the system into a self-reinforcing low-provisioning trap. To break this loop, this paper proposes an adaptive approach named PIC-Reinforcement Learning (PIC-RL), a closed-loop framework that transforms censoring from a data quality problem into a decision signal. PIC-RL integrates (1) Uncertainty-Aware Demand Prediction to manage the information-cost trade-off, (2) Pessimistic Surrogate Inference to construct decision-aligned conservative feedback from shortage events, and (3) Dual-Timescale Adaptation to stabilize online learning against distribution drift. The analysis provides theoretical guarantees that the feedback design corrects the selection bias inherent in naive learning. Experiments on production Alibaba GenAI traces demonstrate that PIC-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing service degradation by up to 50% while maintaining cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Incremental Data Driven Transfer Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric method for online transfer identification of a deterministic linear time-invariant system. At the beginning of the identification process, we assume access to abundant data from a system that is similar, though not identical, to the true system. In the early stages of data collection from the true system, the dataset generated is still not sufficiently informative to enable precise identification. Consequently, multiple candidate models remain consistent with the observations available at that point. Our method picks, at each instant, the model closest to the similar system that is consistent with the current data. As more data are collected, the proposed model gradually moves away from the initial similar system and eventually converges to the true system when the data set grows to be informative. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the incremental transfer identification paradigm, where identified models with minimal data are used to solve the pole placement problem.</description>

      <title>Iterative McCormick Relaxation for Joint Impedance Control and Network Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), e.g., Smart Wires, and Network Topology Optimization (NTO) schemes for mitigating operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. This work aims to optimize and coordinate the operation of distributed VIDs considering fixed and optimized topologies. This problem is inherently non-linear due to power flow equations as well as bilinear terms introduced due to variable line impedance of VIDs. Furthermore, the topology optimization scheme makes it a mixed integer nonlinear problem. To tackle this, we introduce using McCormick relaxation scheme, which converts the bilinear constraints into a linear set of constraints along with the DC power flow equations. We propose an iterative correction of the McCormick relaxation to enhance its accuracy. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, and we present a performance comparison of the iterative McCormick method against the non-linear, SOS2 piecewise linear approximation, and original McCormick relaxation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control of ADT Switched Linear Systems subject to Actuator Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid output-feedback control framework for average dwell-time (ADT) switched linear systems subject to actuator saturation. The considered subsystems may be exponentially unstable, and the saturation nonlinearity is explicitly handled through a deadzone-based representation. The proposed hybrid controller combines mode-dependent full-order dynamic output-feedback controllers with a supervisory reset mechanism that updates controller states at switching instants. By incorporating the reset rule directly into the synthesis conditions, switching boundary constraints and performance requirements are addressed in a unified convex formulation. Sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee exponential stability under ADT switching and a prescribed weighted ${\cal L}_2$-gain disturbance attenuation level for energy-bounded disturbances. An explicit controller construction algorithm is provided based on feasible LMI solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational tractability of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over existing output-feedback saturation control methods.</description>

      <title>Accurate Data-Based State Estimation from Power Loads Inference in Electric Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is a crucial requirement for the reliable operation and control of electric power systems. Here, we construct a data-driven, numerical method to infer missing power load values in large-scale power grids. Given partial observations of power demands, the method estimates the operational state using a linear regression algorithm, exploiting statistical correlations within synthetic training datasets. We evaluate the performance of the method on three synthetic transmission grid test systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by the method in reconstructing missing demand values under various operating conditions. We further apply the method to real data for the transmission power grid of Switzerland. Despite the restricted number of observations in this dataset, the method infers missing power loads rather accurately. Furthermore, Newton-Raphson power flow solutions show that deviations between true and inferred values for power loads result in smaller deviations between true and inferred values for flows on power lines. This ensures that the estimated operational state correctly captures potential line contingencies. Overall, our results indicate that simple data-based regression techniques can provide an efficient and reliable alternative for state estimation in modern power grids.</description>

      <title>Koopman-BoxQP: Solving Large-Scale NMPC at kHz Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems at kilohertz (kHz) rates on standard processors remains a formidable challenge. This paper proposes a Koopman-BoxQP framework that i) learns a linear Koopman high-dimensional model, ii) eliminates the high-dimensional observables to construct a multi-step prediction model of the states and control inputs, iii) penalizes the multi-step prediction model into the objective, which results in a structured box-constrained quadratic program (BoxQP) whose decision variables include both the system states and control inputs, iv) develops a structure-exploited and warm-starting-supported variant of the feasible Mehrotra's interior-point algorithm for BoxQP. Numerical results demonstrate that Koopman-BoxQP can solve a large-scale NMPC problem with $1040$ variables and $2080$ inequalities at a kHz rate.</description>

      <title>A Marginal Reliability Impact Based Accreditation Framework for Capacity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI) based resource accreditation framework for capacity market design. Under this framework, a resource is accredited based on its marginal impact on system reliability, thus aligning the resource accreditation value with its reliability contribution. A key feature of the MRI based accreditation is that the accredited capacities supplied by different resources to the capacity market are substitutable in reliability contribution, a desired feature of homogeneous products. Moreover, with MRI based capacity demand, substitutability between supply and demand for capacity is also achieved. As a result, a capacity market with the MRI based capacity product can better characterize the underlying resource adequacy problem and lead to more efficient market outcomes.</description>

      <title>Parameter Update Laws for Adaptive Control with Affine Equality Parameter Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, constrained parameter update laws for adaptive control with convex equality constraint on the parameters are developed, one based on a gradient only update and the other incorporating concurrent learning (CL) update. The update laws are derived by solving a constrained optimization problem with affine equality constraints. This constrained problem is reformulated as an equivalent unconstrained problem in a new variable, thereby eliminating the equality constraints. The resulting update law is integrated with an adaptive trajectory tracking controller, enabling online learning of the unknown system parameters. Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system with the equality-constrained parameter update law is established. The effectiveness of the proposed equality-constrained adaptive control law is demonstrated through simulations, validating its ability to maintain constraints on the parameter estimates, achieving convergence to the true parameters for CL-based update law, and achieving asymptotic and exponential tracking performance for constrained gradient and constrained CL-based update laws, respectively.</description>

      <title>Incremental Input-to-State Stability and Equilibrium Tracking for Stochastic Contracting Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the contractivity of nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by deterministic inputs and Brownian motions. Given a weighted $\ell_2$-norm for the state space, we show that an SDE is incrementally noise- and input-to-state stable if its vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input. This result is applied to error estimation for time-varying equilibrium tracking in the presence of noise affecting both the system dynamics and the input signals. We consider both Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes modeling unbounded noise and Jacobi diffusion processes modeling bounded noise. Finally, we turn our attention to the associated Fokker-Planck equation of an SDE. For this context, we prove incremental input-to-state stability with respect to an arbitrary $p$-Wasserstein metric when the drift vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input with respect to an arbitrary norm.</description>

      <title>Convex Block-Cholesky Approach to Risk-Constrained Low-thrust Trajectory Design under Operational Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing robust trajectories under uncertainties is an emerging technology that may represent a key paradigm shift in space mission design. As we pursue more ambitious scientific goals (e.g., multi-moon tours, missions with extensive components of autonomy), it becomes more crucial that missions are designed with navigation (Nav) processes in mind. The effect of Nav processes is statistical by nature, as they consist of orbit determination (OD) and flight-path control (FPC). Thus, this mission design paradigm calls for techniques that appropriately quantify statistical effects of Nav, evaluate associated risks, and design missions that ensure sufficiently low risk while minimizing a statistical performance metric; a common metric is Delta-V99: worst-case (99%-quantile) Delta-V expenditure including statistical FPC efforts. In response to the need, this paper develops an algorithm for risk-constrained trajectory optimization under operational uncertainties due to initial state dispersion, navigation error, maneuver execution error, and imperfect dynamics modeling. We formulate it as a nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem and develop a computationally tractable algorithm that combines optimal covariance steering and sequential convex programming (SCP). Specifically, the proposed algorithm takes a block-Cholesky approach for convex formulation of optimal covariance steering, and leverages a recent SCP algorithm, SCvx*, for reliable numerical convergence. We apply the developed algorithm to risk-constrained, statistical trajectory optimization for exploration of dwarf planet Ceres with a Mars gravity assist, and demonstrate the robustness of the statistically-optimal trajectory and FPC policies via nonlinear Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-domain signal processing for holographic MIMO: Foundations, methods, and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) systems represent a paradigm shift in wireless communications by enabling quasi-continuous apertures. Unlike conventional MIMO systems, H-MIMO with subwavelength antenna spacing operates in both far-field and near-field regimes, where classical discrete Fourier transform (DFT) representations fail to sufficiently capture the channel characteristics. To address this challenge, this article provides an overview of the emerging wavenumber-domain signal processing framework. Specifically, by leveraging spatial Fourier plane-wave decomposition to model H-MIMO channels, the wavenumber domain offers a unified and physically consistent basis for characterizing subwavelength-level spatial correlation and spherical wave propagation. This article first introduces the concept of H-MIMO and the wavenumber representation of H-MIMO channels. Next, it elaborates on wavenumber-domain signal processing technologies reported in the literature, including multiplexing, channel estimation, and waveform designs. Finally, it highlights open challenges and outlines future research directions in wavenumber-domain signal processing for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Generating adversarial inputs for a graph neural network model of AC power flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work formulates and solves optimization problems to generate input points that yield high errors between a neural network's predicted AC power flow solution and solutions to the AC power flow equations. We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$\Delta$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</description>

      <title>PHAST: Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal Dynamics Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Process Predictive Iterative Learning Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repetitive motion tasks are common in robotics, but performance can degrade over time due to environmental changes and robot wear and tear. Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment. Across all cases, the proposed approach converges faster and remains robust under injected and natural disturbances while reducing computational cost. This highlights its practicality across a range of repetitive dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Methods for Initial Orbit Determination and Orbit Determination in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.</description>

      <title>TempoNet: Slack-Quantized Transformer-Guided Reinforcement Scheduler for Adaptive Deadline-Centric Real-Time Dispatchs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time schedulers must reason about tight deadlines under strict compute budgets. We present TempoNet, a reinforcement learning scheduler that pairs a permutation-invariant Transformer with a deep Q-approximation. An Urgency Tokenizer discretizes temporal slack into learnable embeddings, stabilizing value learning and capturing deadline proximity. A latency-aware sparse attention stack with blockwise top-k selection and locality-sensitive chunking enables global reasoning over unordered task sets with near-linear scaling and sub-millisecond inference. A multicore mapping layer converts contextualized Q-scores into processor assignments through masked-greedy selection or differentiable matching. Extensive evaluations on industrial mixed-criticality traces and large multiprocessor settings show consistent gains in deadline fulfillment over analytic schedulers and neural baselines, together with improved optimization stability. Diagnostics include sensitivity analyses for slack quantization, attention-driven policy interpretation, hardware-in-the-loop and kernel micro-benchmarks, and robustness under stress with simple runtime mitigations; we also report sample-efficiency benefits from behavioral-cloning pretraining and compatibility with an actor-critic variant without altering the inference pipeline. These results establish a practical framework for Transformer-based decision making in high-throughput real-time scheduling.</description>

      <title>Learning to Tune Pure Pursuit in Autonomous Racing: Joint Lookahead and Steering-Gain Control with PPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure Pursuit (PP) is widely used in autonomous racing for real-time path tracking due to its efficiency and geometric clarity, yet performance is highly sensitive to how key parameters-lookahead distance and steering gain-are chosen. Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach that jointly chooses the lookahead Ld and a steering gain g online using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy observes compact state features (speed and curvature taps) and outputs (Ld, g) at each control step. Trained in F1TENTH Gym and deployed in a ROS 2 stack, the policy drives PP directly (with light smoothing) and requires no per-map retuning. Across simulation and real-car tests, the proposed RL-PP controller that jointly selects (Ld, g) consistently outperforms fixed-lookahead PP, velocity-scheduled adaptive PP, and an RL lookahead-only variant, and it also exceeds a kinematic MPC raceline tracker under our evaluated settings in lap time, path-tracking accuracy, and steering smoothness, demonstrating that policy-guided parameter tuning can reliably improve classical geometry-based control.</description>

      <title>A Non-intrusive Decentralized Approach to Stabilizing IBR-dominated AC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09450v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a non-intrusive, decentralized approach that stabilizes AC microgrids dominated by inverter-based resources (IBRs). By "non-intrusive" we mean that the approach does not require reprogramming IBRs' controllers to stabilize the microgrids. "Decentralized" is in the sense that the approach stabilizes the microgrids without communication among IBRs. Implementing the approach only requires very minimal information of IBR dynamics, i.e., the L2 gain of an IBR, and sharing such information with the non-IBR-manufacturer parties does not cause any concerns on intellectual property privacy. The approach allows for plug-and-play operation of IBRs, while maintaining microgrid stability. The proposed approach is tested by simulating 2-IBR and 10-IBR microgrids where lines and IBRs are modeled in the electromagnetic transient time scale. Simulations show that oscillations with increasing amplitudes may occur, when two stable microgrids are networked. Simulations also suggest that the proposed approach can mitigate such a system-level symptom.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for Induced Seismicity Mitigation in Underground Reservoirs Governed by a Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust output-feedback controller for induced seismicity mitigation in geological reservoirs described by a coupled 3D PDE-ODE model. The controller is a MIMO Super-Twisting design, producing a continuous control signal and requiring minimal model information, while accommodating parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity. Two operational outputs are regulated simultaneously: regional pressures and seismicity rates computed over reservoir sub-regions. Closed-loop properties are established via explicit bounds on the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional dynamics and the nonlinear ODE system, yielding finite-time or exponential convergence of the tracking errors. The method is evaluated on a Groningen gas-field case study in two scenarios: gas production while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region, and combined production with CO$_2$ injection toward net-zero operation. Simulations demonstrate accurate tracking of pressure and seismicity targets across regions under significant parameter uncertainty, supporting safer reservoir operation without sacrificing production objectives.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Tracking of Large-Scale Systems Impacted by Time Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper focuses on tracking eigenvalue trajectories in power system models with time delays. We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation is compatible with sparse delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) formulations of the system model and allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with implementation aspects discussed in detail. The proposed approach is illustrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a real-world-scale dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.</description>

      <title>PhiBE: A PDE-based Bellman Equation for Continuous Time Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study policy evaluation in continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL), where the state follows an unknown stochastic differential equation (SDE), but only discrete-time data are available. We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new Bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations.
  We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification, together with finite-sample guarantees. In contrast to existing continuous-time RL analyses, where the model misspecification error diverges as the sampling interval $\Delta t\to 0$ and the sample complexity typically scales as $O(\Delta t^{-4})$, our misspecification error is independent of $\Delta t$ and the resulting sample complexity improves to $O(\Delta t^{-1})$ by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Moreover, we identify a fundamental trade-off between discretization error and sample error that is intrinsic to continuous-time policy evaluation: finer time discretization reduces bias but amplifies variance, so excessively frequent sampling does not necessarily improve performance. This is an insight that does not arise in classical discrete-time RL analyses. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Online Smoothed Demand Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time before a demand-specific deadline $\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to above constraints) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm for $\texttt{OSDM}$ called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting &amp; aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.</description>
