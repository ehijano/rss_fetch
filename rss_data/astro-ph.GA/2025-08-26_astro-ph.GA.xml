      <title>Energy-Space Analysis of Tidal Stripping in Stellar-Dark Matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations reveal a striking diversity in dwarf galaxy structures, spanning a wide range of masses, inner density slopes, shapes, and sizes. Tidal stripping may play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of these galaxies, yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using idealized N-body simulations, we investigate the tidal evolution of two-component systems -- stellar and dark matter -- embedded in a host potential. We find that in terms of energy distributions, both stellar and dark matter particles are stripped identically, regardless of their initial profiles. This surprising result suggests that the energy distribution of stripped stars can provide direct constraints on the underlying dark matter structure. Furthermore, we show that systems with cored dark matter and cuspy stellar profiles naturally evolve into dark matter-deficient (DMD) galaxies, supporting tidal stripping as a viable DMD formation pathway. This energy-space analysis of multi-component systems offers new insights into the dynamical evolution of tidally stripped galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the Variability Features of Active Galactic Nuclei in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-redshift ($z&gt;4$) compact sources with ``V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of $22$ LRDs in \citet{Tee2025}. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute $\lesssim30\%$ of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about $200$ LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is $\leq 0.07$ mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.</description>

      <title>Effects of Halo Anisotropy on Disc Galaxy Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical galaxy models with radially anisotropic velocity distributions merge faster than their isotropic counterparts. Here we investigate the effects of radially anisotropic haloes on the dynamics of disc galaxy encounters. We use stable galaxy models with isotropic bulges, thin rotating discs, and dark haloes which are either isotropic or radially anisotropic. Our simulations confirm that anisotropy can markedly accelerate orbit decay in galaxy interactions; in particular, radially anisotropic haloes transfer a good deal of orbital angular momentum to internal motions even before the galaxies reach their first pericentre. Consequently, for a given initial orbit, the anisotropic models undergo closer and more violent interactions, and their discs generate more massive tidal features. If real disc galaxies have radially anisotropic haloes, our findings may have implications for estimated merger time-scales and remnant morphology.</description>

      <title>Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present written notes from three lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course of the Swiss Society of Astrophysics and Astronomy in January 2025 entitled "Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years as seen by the JWST". I focused my lectures on progress in studies of cosmic reionisation, the properties of galaxies in the reionisation era, topics related to the redshift frontier and the search for Population III stars. The lectures were given to graduate students in astrophysics and cover both pedagogical material as well as observational results from the first two and half years of JWST science operations. The pace of discovery with JWST is, of course, rapid and so my lectures discuss long-term goals, analysis methods and their assumptions and limitations in the hope that the underlying material will retain value in the near future. In this written version, the visual material is that presented at Saas-Fee in January 2025 but I have provided updates on progress from the literature up to August 2025. The material is aimed at early career researchers and should not be considered as a scholarly review of the entire JWST literature on high redshift galaxies</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Star Formation History in massive galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;4.5$ with spectro-photometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of massive galaxies ($M_\star \geq 10^{10} \, M_\odot$) in the redshift range $1 &lt; z &lt; 4.5$. We analyze spectro-photometric data combining broadband photometry from HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes, BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution, significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the mass-weighted stellar age ($t_M$) and formation redshift ($z_{\mathrm{form}}$), by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50\% of their mass between $3 \leq z \leq 9$. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with elevated star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon$) at early epochs. Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at $z &lt; 2$. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older ($t_M \sim 1.1$ Gyr) and assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts. These findings support the ``downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multiphase Galactic Outflows: A Multifluid Moving Mesh Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties: stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Jetted Wandering Massive Black Hole Candidate in a Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wandering massive black holes (MBHs) are thought to form through gravitational recoil or galaxy mergers, but observational confirmation of their displacement in dwarf galaxies, critical laboratories for early-universe SMBH seeding, remains scarce. Using multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), we identify a displaced MBH in the dwarf galaxy MaNGA 12772-12704, located 0.94 kilo-parsec from its optical center. The source exhibits unambiguous signatures of an accreting MBH: a brightness temperature exceeding $10^9$K, a parsec-scale jet, and flux density variability over a 30-year baseline. This system provides the first robust evidence that dynamical black hole interactions predicted in hierarchical galaxy evolution occur even in low-mass hosts. The discovery challenges models requiring centralized gas reservoirs for MBH growth and directly informs high-redshift seeding scenarios.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET : Kinetic, Thermal and Magnetic AGN Feedback in Massive Galaxies at Halo Masses $\sim 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r&lt;15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r&lt;1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.</description>

      <title>AGNs in the extremely overdense galaxy region BOSS 1441: A Chandra observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at $z=2.32\pm0.02$ that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of $\rm 6.85\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the rest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 - 13.96)\rm\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$. Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a $&gt; 5'$ offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray detected AGNs among the LAEs to be $11.5^{+3.8}_{-4.6}\%$, approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ($6.9^{+6.9}_{-4.5}\%$), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster's massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Simplified Chemistries for H2O and CO in three-phase astrochemical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrochemical models can be greatly simplified, with obvious computational advantages, if the reaction networks for key species can be reduced to a bare minimum. In addition, if chemical equilibrium holds, then simple analytical solutions can be formulated. These have particular advantages in the application to complex models evolving over multi-point spatial grids. In this study, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO and H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of the ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain astrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to account for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice layers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption. We find that a very close match is obtained to the results from detailed three-phase models of the time-dependent astrochemistry, and the abundances are typically accurate to within a factor of two over the entire range of densities and extinction that are applicable to dense clouds and young star-forming regions. In addition, these solutions give accurate results over most of the range of conditions even for systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution. Although there are some caveats of applicability, we therefore recommend that these solutions be used in models of cold molecular environments where the rapid calculation of the abundances of CO, H2O and atomic coolants is helpful.</description>

      <title>A$^3$COSMOS: The dust content of massive quiescent galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z&gt;1$ are recently quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority of QGs observed at $z&lt;1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$) are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM, while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.</description>

      <title>Shocks and complex chemodynamics in the metal-poor starburst galaxy CGCG 007-025 revealed through high-resolution echelle spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Magellan/MIKE echelle spectroscopy to conduct an in-depth chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the wavelength range 3400-9200\AA. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O), log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s) HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426, indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks. This dataset underscores the capability of echelle spectroscopy in delivering comprehensive chemodynamical analyses of starbursts in the Local Volume.</description>

Abstract: The interstellar dust grains are swept up during the expansion of the supernova (SN) remnant, they penetrate behind the shock front, where they are heated and destroyed in the hot gas. This leads to a change in emissivity of such grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR) luminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR luminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first several thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value. Afterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas and their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show how the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of the gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the significant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity peaks at the range centered at 70$\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered as the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that during evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only slightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase, the strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their luminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\sim 10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is reached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss possibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in lines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of the medium, where the remnant is expanding.</description>

      <title>Detection of CFIRB with AKARI/FIS Deep Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:0705.1862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   The Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CFIRB) contains information about the number and distribution of contributing sources and thus gives us an important key to understand the evolution of galaxies. Using a confusion study to set a fundamental limit to the observations, we investigate the potential to explore the CFIRB with AKARI/FIS deep observations. The Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) is one of the focal-plane instruments on the AKARI (formerly known as ASTRO-F) satellite, which was launched in early 2006. Based upon source distribution models assuming three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios (no evolution, weak evolution, and strong evolution), an extensive model for diffuse emission from infrared cirrus, and instrumental noise estimates, we present a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion levels for deep far-infrared observations. We use our derived sensitivities to suggest the best observational strategy for the AKARI/FIS mission to detect the CFIRB fluctuations. If the source distribution follows the evolutionary models, observations will be mostly limited by source confusion. We find that we will be able to detect the CFIRB fluctuations and that these will in turn provide information to discriminate between the evolutionary scenarios of galaxies in most low-to-medium cirrus regions.</description>

      <title>The Far-Infrared Properties of Spatially Resolved AKARI Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:0708.0254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We present the spatially resolved observations of IRAS sources from the Japanese infrared astronomy satellite AKARI All-Sky Survey during the performance verification (PV) phase of the mission. We extracted reliable point sources matched with IRAS point source catalogue. By comparing IRAS and AKARI fluxes, we found that the flux measurements of some IRAS sources could have been over or underestimated and affected by the local background rather than the global background. We also found possible candidates for new AKARI sources and confirmed that AKARI observations resolved IRAS sources into multiple sources. All-Sky Survey observations are expected to verify the accuracies of IRAS flux measurements and to find new extragalactic point sources.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy Reveals Hidden Neutron-capture Elemental Abundance Differences among APOGEE-identified Chemical Doppelg\"angers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grouping stars by chemical similarity has the potential to reveal the Milky Way's evolutionary history. The APOGEE stellar spectroscopic survey has the resolution and sensitivity for this task. However, APOGEE lacks access to strong lines of neutron-capture elements ($Z &gt; 28$) which have nucleosynthetic origins that are distinct from those of the lighter elements. We assess whether APOGEE abundances are sufficient for selecting chemically similar disk stars by identifying 25 pairs of chemical ``doppelgangers'' in APOGEE DR17 and following them up with the Tull spectrograph, an optical, $R \sim 60{,}000$ echelle on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-m telescope. Line-by-line differential analyses of pairs' optical spectra reveals neutron-capture (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu) elemental abundance differences of $\Delta$[X/Fe] $\rm \sim 0.020 \pm 0.015$ to $0.380 \pm 0.15$ dex (4--140%), and up to 0.05 dex (12%) on average, a factor of 1--2 times higher than intra-cluster pairs. This is despite the pairs sharing nearly identical APOGEE-reported abundances and [C/N] ratios, a tracer of giant-star age. This work illustrates that even when APOGEE abundances derived from SNR $&gt; 300$ spectra are available, optically-measured neutron-capture element abundances contain critical information about composition similarity. These results hold implications for the chemical dimensionality of the disk, mixing within the interstellar medium, and chemical tagging with the neutron-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pressure Dominance Stabilizes AGN Disks Against Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic effects have long been considered a possible factor in stabilizing the outer regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks against gravitational instability (GI). However, the computational demands of testing this hypothesis have prevented comprehensive study of this problem. Here, we present results from a suite of 6 isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) shearing box simulations, 3 initialized with strong magnetization ($\beta^{\rm{mid}}_{0} = p_{\rm{gas}} / p_{\rm{mag}} = 10^{2.5}$) and 3 initialized with weak magnetization ($\beta^{\rm mid}_{0} = 10^{4}$). For each magnetization, we performed simulations with both strong ($Q_{0} = 1.0$) and weak ($Q_{0} = 10.0$) self-gravity, where $Q_{0} = \frac{c_{\rm{s}}\Omega}{\pi G \Sigma_{0}}$ is the Toomre stability parameter; we also performed pure MHD simulations for comparison. We find that our strongly magnetized disk stabilized against GI after initialization to critical stability against GI, while our corresponding weakly magnetized disk did not. We show that the strongly magnetized, strongly self-gravitating disk became dominated by magnetic pressure, which led to its stabilization.</description>

      <title>$\textit{BMAD}$-Circumbinary Magnetically Arrested Disks around Stellar or Black Hole Binaries: Hot Accretion Flows, Disk Properties, and Angular Momentum Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary accretion flow can be subject to strong magnetic fields, potentially altering the character of the accretion flow itself, the evolution of the orbital dynamics, and outflow properties from the system. Here we focus on a regime where magnetic fields become so strong that the outer circumbinary flow becomes magnetically arrested, establishing a (circum)binary magnetically arrested disk ($\textit{BMAD}$) state. Such flows feature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower outflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular momentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass binary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that of the (large-scale) magnetic field topology. Our findings are as follows: (1) A magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity can generally be achieved, so long as the initial seed field is strong enough. (2) The cavity, and magnetic flux tube properties and their subsequent propagation are subject to the choice of equation of state/cooling physics. (3) We find tentative evidence that in some regimes the BMAD state, particularly during a flux eruption cycle, can aid shrinking of the binary's orbit. The regimes we explore have implications for multi-messenger transients to stars, supermassive and stellar black hole binaries and their orbital evolution in gaseous environments.</description>

      <title>GeV-TeV Connections in Galaxies: Evolutionary Signatures from Pulsars in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant mechanisms underlying high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from galaxies vary by galaxy type. In starbursts, a major contribution comes from neutral pion decay. This is driven by interactions between interstellar gas and hadronic cosmic rays (CRs), which are accelerated in strong shocks associated star formation activity and stellar remnants. Leptonic $\gamma$-ray emission can also arise from electrons directly energized in interstellar shocks, produced via charged pion decays, or emitted by pulsars and their surrounding halos. In quiescent galaxies, pulsars and their halos can represent a major $\gamma$-ray source class, with millisecond pulsars predominantly located in globular clusters (GCs) being particularly important. Recent detections of very high-energy (VHE) emission from Galactic GCs suggests they may also contribute to the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux from evolved galaxies. We consider a scenario where this VHE emission from GCs is powered by electrons accelerated in communal stellar/pulsar wind cluster termination shocks. These electrons undergo inverse Compton scattering as they propagate into GC magnetotails. Our results show that the high-energy emission from GCs can be an important contributor to the GeV and TeV flux from massive, quiescent galaxies. The relative strength of each component depends on the global galactic properties and its evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>High-$z$ SMBHs in Cosmological Models with Enhanced Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of non-power-law spectra of matter perturbations with a bump or with a blue tilt at small scales on the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located the innermost part of galaxies. We study SMBH's mass growth rate and the epochs of their birth in four cosmological models using N-body simulations of dark matter within the box of $(100$~Mpc$/h)^3$. The simulations were populated with SMBHs using TRINITY semi-analytic model. We found that the most massive SMBHs at the redshifts $z=5-6$ are similar in all considered cosmologies, including the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. At larger $z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\Lambda$CDM model) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring super-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at $z\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\Lambda$CMD model.</description>

      <title>On the Spatial Distribution of Luminous Blue Variables, B[e] Supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spatial distributions of LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and W-R stars in the LMC, to clarify their relative ages, evolutionary states, and relationships. This survey employs a reference catalog that was not available for previous work, comprising more than 3900 of the LMC's most luminous stars. Our analysis shows that LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and WR's have spatial distributions like normal stars with the same spectral types and luminosities. Most LBV's are not isolated, nor do they require binary or multiple status to explain their spatial relationship to other populations. There are two likely exceptions: one lower-luminosity LBV and one LBV candidate are relatively isolated and may have velocities that require additional acceleration. The B[e] supergiants are spatially and kinematically more dispersed than LBV's, suggesting that they belong to an older population. The most luminous early-type WN's are most closely associated with the evolved late O-type supergiants. The high luminosity late WN's, however, are highly concentrated in the 30 Dor region which biases the analysis. The less luminous WN's and WC's are associated with a mix of evolved late B, A-type, and yellow supergiants which may be in a post-red-supergiant phase. Spatial distributions of the less luminous WN, WC, and WN3/O3 stars reinforce proposed evolutionary links among those subtypes. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using a comprehensive census, with reference populations clearly defined by spectral type and luminosity, and how small number statistics, especially combined with spatial clustering, can invalidate some commonly-cited statistical tests.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C--MetaLL) survey: VII. Metallicity dependence of Period-Wesenheit relations based on a homogeneous spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period--Wesenheit--metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</description>

      <title>The Near-Infrared Echo from SN 2023xgo: Evidence for a Massive Pre-Supernova Eruption in a Type Ibn/Icn Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations and analysis of the Type Ibn/Icn supernova (SN) 2023xgo, spanning the period from two days to 100 days past explosion. A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution with those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from 15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a combination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust temperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d. The estimated dust mass is $\sim1.2 \times10^{-4}~M_{\odot}$. Based on the SN emission of $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak luminosity, the evaporation radius is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{16}$ cm, consistent with the expectation from light travel time. The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense shell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\times10^{14}$ cm. It suggests that the observed NIR excess originates from pre-existing circumstellar (CS) dust. Considering a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio, the CS gas mass is estimated to be $\simeq10^{-2}~M_{\odot}$, implying a high mass-loss rate of $\sim0.1~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ from either a low-mass helium star progenitor with a binary interaction, or may be a massive Wolf-Rayet star that experienced a significant eruption.</description>

      <title>The Detection of Teraelectronvolt Radiation from a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very high-energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) radiation carries the signatures of the matter-energy interaction in some of the most extreme astrophysical environments. Considering broad emission line blazars, i.e., flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), the dense photon fields surrounding the relativistic jet can prohibit the particle population from accelerating to very high energies and producing VHE radiation. They can also possibly make the environment opaque for the VHE $\gamma$ rays due to $\gamma\gamma$ pair production, thus explaining the paucity of VHE-detected FSRQs and non-detection of TeV radiation ($&gt;$1 TeV) from them. Here we report, for the first time, a $&gt;$7$\sigma$ detection of an FSRQ, S5 1027+74 ($z=0.123$), in the VHE band, including the first ever detection of TeV emission from an object of this class, using the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. Its $\gamma$-ray spectrum covering the 100 MeV to 2 TeV band revealed a prominent spectral break with a flat, rising shape above $\sim$10 GeV, a feature never detected from other VHE-detected FSRQs. The radio-to-$\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of S5 1027+74 provides strong evidence of a third bump peaking at multi-TeV energies. These enigmatic findings imply that FSRQ jets can accelerate particles to extremely high energies and provide tantalizing clues about the complex radiative environment of relativistic jets.</description>

Abstract: The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Inferring Mbh-Mbulge Evolution from the Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass scaling relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background (GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 10^11 Msun at z &gt; 1). When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as alpha(z) = alpha_0 (1 + z)^(1.04 +/- 0.5).</description>

      <title>JWST detection of a carbon dioxide dominated gas coma surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 6.1-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>

      <title>Free-floating Planets Produced by Planet-Planet Scatterings: Ejection Velocity and Survival Rate of Their Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of numerous free-floating planets (FFPs) has intensified interest in their origins and dynamical histories. A leading formation mechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems, which can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally host moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain gravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both the ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the survival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining the statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection, and comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host planet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an analytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy conservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a minimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems with finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to determine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial semi-major axis. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer insights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for exomoons around them.</description>

      <title>ASTRO-F/FIS Observing Simulation: Detection Limits for Point Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/0204377v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We describe the observing simulation software FISVI (FIS Virtual Instrument), which was developed for the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) that will be on the Japanese infrared astronomy mission ASTRO-F. The FISVI has two purposes: one is to check the specifications and performances of the ASTRO-F/FIS as a whole; the other is to prepare input data sets for the data analysis softwares prior to launch. In the FISVI, special care was taken by introducing the "Compiled PSF (Point Spread Function)" to optimise inevitable, but time-consuming, convolution processes. With the Compiled PSF, we reduce the computation time by an order of magnitude. The photon and readout noises are included in the simulations. We estimate the detection limits for point sources from the simulation of virtual patches of the sky mostly consisting of distant galaxies. We studied the importance of source confusion for simple power-law models for N(&gt;S), the number of sources brighter than S. We found that source confusion plays a dominant role in the detection limits only for models with rapid luminosity evolution for the galaxy counts, the evolution of which is suggested by recent observations.</description>

      <title>Far-IR Detection Limits I: Sky Confusion Due to Galactic Cirrus</title>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/0411431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Fluctuations in the brightness of the background radiation can lead to confusion with real point sources. Such background emission confusion will be important for infrared observations with relatively large beam sizes since the amount of fluctuation tends to increase with angular scale. In order to quantitively assess the effect of the background emission on the detection of point sources for current and future far-infrared observations by space-borne missions such as Spitzer, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA, we have extended the Galactic emission map to higher angular resolution than the currently available data. Using this high resolution map, we estimate the sky confusion noise due to the emission from interstellar dust clouds or cirrus, based on fluctuation analysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images. We find that the confusion noise derived by simple fluctuation analysis agrees well with the result from realistic simulations. Although the sky confusion noise becomes dominant in long wavelength bands (&gt; 100 um) with 60 - 90cm aperture missions, it is expected to be two order of magnitude smaller for the next generation space missions with larger aperture sizes such as Herschel and SPICA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/0603163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We present a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion levels for the current and the next generation of far-infrared surveys assuming three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios. We include an extensive model for diffuse emission from infrared cirrus in order to derive absolute sensitivity levels taking into account the source confusion noise due to point sources, the sky confusion noise due to the diffuse emission, and instrumental noise. We use our derived sensitivities to suggest best survey strategies for the current and the future far-infrared space missions Spitzer, AKARI (ASTRO-F), Herschel, and SPICA. We discuss whether the theoretical estimates are realistic and the competing necessities of reliability and completeness. We find the best estimator for the representation of the source confusion and produce predictions for the source confusion using far-infrared source count models. From these confusion limits considering both source and sky confusions, we obtain the optimal, confusion limited redshift distribution for each mission. Finally, we predict the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CFIRB) which includes information about the number and distribution of the contributing sources.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of red and blue galaxies in different cosmic web environments using IllustrisTNG simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of red and blue galaxies in different cosmic web environments from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$ using the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Otsu's method to classify the red or blue galaxies at each redshift and determine their geometric environments from the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor. Our analysis shows that initially, blue galaxies are more common in clusters followed by filaments, sheets and voids. However, this trend reverses at lower redshifts, with red fractions rising earlier in denser environments. At $z&lt;1$, most massive galaxies ($\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})&gt;10.5$) are quenched across all environments. In contrast, low-mass galaxies ($\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})&lt;10.5$) are more influenced by their environment, with clusters hosting the highest red galaxy fractions at low redshifts. We observe a slower mass growth for low-mass galaxies in clusters at $z&lt;1$. Filaments show relative red fractions (RRF) comparable to clusters at low masses, but host nearly $60\%$ of low-mass blue galaxies, representing a diverse galaxy population. It implies that less intense environmental quenching in filaments allows galaxies to experience a broader range of evolutionary stages. Despite being the densest environment, clusters display the highest relative blue fraction (RBF) for high-mass galaxies, likely due to interactions or mergers that can temporarily rejuvenate star formation in some of them. The $(u-r)$ colour distribution transitions from unimodal to bimodal by redshift $z=2$ across all environments. At $z&lt;1$, clusters exhibit the highest median colour and lowest median specific star formation rate (sSFR), with stellar mass being the primary driver of colour evolution in massive galaxies. Our study suggests that stellar mass governs quenching in high-mass galaxies, while a complex interplay of mass and environment shapes the evolution of low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Radio-loudness statistics of quasars from Quaia-VLASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are objects of high interest in extragalactic astrophysics, cosmology, and astrometry. One of their useful qualities is their potential radio loudness. However, the fraction of radio-loud vs. radio-quiet quasars is subject to ongoing investigations, where the statistical power is limited by the low number of known quasars with radio counterparts. In this analysis, we revisited the radio loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding the pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added quasar catalog with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes, radio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other flags, besides their sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical Quaia catalog of about 1.3 million quasars (from the Gaia data) with 1.9 million sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalog. We explored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing completeness and purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalog, and found 1.5 arcseconds a sufficient choice. Our main finding is that the quasar radio-loud fraction is in good agreement with previous works (&lt; 10%), and there is no significant large-scale sky pattern in radio loudness. The exact estimate depends on the G-band magnitude limit, and we observed weak trends with redshift and absolute optical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data. The cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalog with 43,650 sources and accompanying code are freely available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.16035690. This latest census of QSOs with radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of research.</description>

      <title>Trial by FIRE: Probing the dark matter density profile of dwarf galaxies with GraphNPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Matter (DM) distribution in dwarf galaxies provides crucial insights into both structure formation and the particle nature of DM. GraphNPE (Graph Neural Posterior Estimator), first introduced in Nguyen et al. (2023), is a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines graph neural networks and normalizing flows to infer the DM density profile from line-of-sight stellar velocities. Here, we apply GraphNPE to satellite dwarf galaxies in the FIRE-2 Latte simulation suite of Milky Way-mass halos, testing it against both Cold and Self-Interacting DM scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior precision compared to conventional Jeans-based approaches, recovering DM density profiles to within the 95% confidence level even in systems with as few as 30 tracers. Moreover, we present the first evaluation of mass modeling methods in constraining two key parameters from realistic simulations: the peak circular velocity, $V_\mathrm{max}$, and the peak virial mass, $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$. Using only line-of-sight velocities, GraphNPE can reliably recover both $V_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ within our quoted uncertainties, including those experiencing tidal effects ($\gtrsim$ 63% of systems are recovered with our 68% confidence intervals and $\gtrsim$ 92% within our 95% confidence intervals). The method achieves 10-20% accuracy in $V_\mathrm{max}$ recovery, while $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ is recovered to 0.1-0.4 dex accuracy. This work establishes GraphNPE as a robust tool for inferring DM density profiles in dwarf galaxies, offering promising avenues for constraining DM models. The framework's potential extends beyond this study, as it can be adapted to non-spherical and disequilibrium models, showcasing the broader utility of simulation-based inference and graph-based learning in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Starburst-Driven Galactic Outflows -- Unveiling the Suppressive Role of Cosmic Ray Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) halos in shaping the properties of starburst-driven galactic outflows. Methods. We develop a microphysical model for galactic outflows driven by a continuous central feedback source, incorporating a simplified treatment of CRs. The model parameters are linked to the effective properties of a starburst. By analyzing its asymptotic behavior, we derive a criterion for launching starburst-driven galactic outflows and determine the corresponding outflow velocities. Results. We find that in the absence of CRs, galactic outflows can only be launched if the star-formation rate (SFR) surface density exceeds a critical threshold proportional to the dynamical equilibrium pressure. In contrast, CRs can always drive slow outflows. CRs dominate in systems with SFR surface densities below the critical threshold but become negligible in highly star-forming systems. However, in older systems with established CR halos, the CR contribution to outflows diminishes once the outflow reaches the galactic scale height, rendering CRs ineffective in sustaining outflows in such systems. Conclusions. Over cosmic time, galaxies accumulate relic CRs in their halos, providing additional non-thermal pressure support that suppresses low-velocity CR-driven outflows. We predict that such low-velocity outflows are expected only in young systems that have not yet built up significant CR halos. In contrast, fast outflows in starburst galaxies, where the SFR surface density exceeds the critical threshold, are primarily driven by momentum injection and remain largely unaffected by CR halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental quenching -- where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies -- has been well-established as the primary driver behind the formation of the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;1$). However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms are active at higher-redshifts in proto-cluster environments that are not yet fully virialized. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, JWST has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$$&lt;$9.0) galaxies at cosmic noon ($2 &lt; z &lt; 3$). Here, we leverage the deep imaging and R$\sim$15 spectrophotometry enabled by the 20 band JWST/NIRCam data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to examine environmental quenching in a newly discovered $z\approx2.58$ proto-cluster. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 low-mass quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster to a matched sample of 18 in the field, and find no significant differences. This similarity extends to galaxy sizes and quenched fractions, which also show no significant differences between the two environments across the full stellar mass range (8.5$&lt;$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$$\leq$11.0). This indicates that the proto-cluster has not yet accelerated quenching relative to the field and is consistent with expectations that $z&gt;2$ proto-clusters have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment required to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-dominated CGM: the origin of UV absorbers with equivalent widths of $\sim1$\AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and observations suggest that in massive halos ($&gt;10^{12}\,M_\odot$), the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by a 'hot' phase with gas temperature near the virial temperature ($T \approx T_{\rm vir}$) and a quasi-hydrostatic pressure profile. Lower-mass halos are however unlikely to be filled with a similar quasi-static hot phase, due to rapid radiative cooling. Using the FIRE cosmological zoom simulations, we demonstrate that the hot phase is indeed sub-dominant at inner radii ($\lesssim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$) of $\lesssim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ halos, and the inner CGM is instead filled with $T \ll T_{\rm vir}$ gas originating in outflows and inflows, with a turbulent velocity comparable to the halo virial velocity. The turbulent velocity thus exceeds the mass-weighted sound speed in the inner CGM, and the turbulence is supersonic. UV absorption features from such CGM trace the wide lognormal density distributions of the predominantly cool and turbulent volume-filling phase, in contrast with tracing localized cool 'clouds' embedded in a hot medium. We predict equivalent widths of $W_\lambda \sim 2\lambda v_c/c \sim 1A$ for a broad range of strong UV and EUV transitions (Mg II, C II, C IV, Si II-IV, O III-V) in sightlines through inner CGM dominated by turbulent pressure of $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies at redshifts $0 \leq z \lesssim 2$, where $\lambda$ is the transition wavelength, $v_{\rm c}$ is the halo circular velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. Comparison of our predictions with observational constraints suggests that star-forming dwarf and $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies are generally dominated by turbulent pressure in their inner CGM, rather than by thermal pressure. The inner CGM surrounding these galaxies is thus qualitatively distinct from that around quenched galaxies and massive disks such as the Milky-Way and M31, in which thermal pressure likely dominates.</description>

      <title>Euclid: The potential of slitless infrared spectroscopy: A z=5.4 quasar and new ultracool dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of Euclid's slitless spectroscopy to discover high-redshift (z&gt;5) quasars and their main photometric contaminant, ultracool dwarfs. Sensitive infrared spectroscopy from space is able to efficiently identify both populations, as demonstrated by Euclid Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer Red Grism (NISP RGE) spectra of the newly discovered z=5.404 quasar EUCL J181530.01+652054.0, as well as several ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Field North and the Euclid Early Release Observation field Abell 2764. The ultracool dwarfs were identified by cross-correlating their spectra with templates. The quasar was identified by its strong and broad CIII] and MgII emission lines in the NISP RGE 1206-1892 nm spectrum, and confirmed through optical spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope. The NISP Blue Grism (NISP BGE) 926-1366 nm spectrum confirms CIV and CIII] emission. NISP RGE can find bright quasars at z~5.5 and z&gt;7, redshift ranges that are challenging for photometric selection due to contamination from ultracool dwarfs. EUCL J181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected at 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 3e12 Lsun and is powered by a 3.4e9 Msun black hole. The discovery of this bright quasar is noteworthy as fewer than one such object was expected in the ~20 deg2 surveyed. This finding highlights the potential and effectiveness of NISP spectroscopy in identifying rare, luminous high-redshift quasars, previewing the census of these sources that Euclid's slitless spectroscopy will deliver over about 14,000 deg2 of the sky.</description>

      <title>JWST reveals cosmic ray dominated chemistry in the local ULIRG IRAS 07251$-$0248</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N) detected in the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}/Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer spectrum (4.9--27.9\,$\upmu$m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160\,km\,s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185\,K for these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a by--product of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell ($\dot{M}$$\sim$90--330\,$M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3\, \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the range of $-$18.2 (from H$_3^+$) to $-$19.1 (inferred from HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are likely tracing denser gas), consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.</description>

      <title>The intracluster light as an estimator of the cluster mass profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The intracluster light (ICL) comprises stars that are not bound to individual galaxies within a galaxy cluster, and it provides insights into the cluster mass distribution, evolutionary history, and dynamical state. Aims. We study the viability of the intracluster stellar mass as a proxy for computing the total mass profiles of galaxy clusters. Methods. High-resolution simulations from the C-EAGLE project were used to study the ratio of the intracluster stellar mass and total matter projected densities. This ratio follows a power law, and we present a model for its fit parameters and associated errors. Results. We used this relation to estimate the mass profile of the Perseus cluster based on Euclid observations that extend up to one-third of the virial radius. The obtained cluster mass is compatible with other measurements from galaxy velocity dispersion, but it is overestimated by a factor of two compared to X-ray mass estimates. We repeated this process for four clusters in the Hubble Frontier Fields, finding compatibility with weak- and strong-lensing mass estimates. Conclusions. This method provides an independent approach to cluster mass estimation that is based solely on the observed ICL and a simulation-calibrated relation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Proper Motions of M31 and M33 Using Massive Supergiant Stars with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper motions (PMs) of M31 and M33 are key to understanding the Local Group's dynamical evolution. However, measurement discrepancies between Gaia blue and red samples, regarding whether the transverse velocity is remarkable, introduce significant ambiguity. In this work, we remeasure the systemic PMs of M31 and M33 using massive supergiant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Clean disk tracers are selected via color-color diagrams, with foreground contaminants removed through kinematic and astrometric cuts. We identify the discrepancy in M31's blue and red samples as arising from systematic differences between Gaia's 5-parameter (5p) and 6-parameter (6p) astrometric solutions. The 6p solution, applied to sources lacking accurate color information, relies on a pseudo-color approximation, leading to lower precision and larger uncertainties. Two key limitations of the 6p solution are: 1) degraded astrometric accuracy for very red sources (GBP - GRP &gt; 2.6); 2) significant PM zero-point offsets. In our sample, red sources are dominated by the 6p solution, while blue sources include a substantial fraction of 5p sources; this mismatch drives the observed discrepancy. By excluding extreme red sources and calibrating PM zero-points separately for 5p and 6p sources using background quasars, we reduce the discrepancy, bringing blue and red measurements into agreement within 1 sigma. We ultimately report the most robust Gaia-based PMs using high-quality 5p sources. For M31, we obtain ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M31 = (45.9 +/- 8.1, -20.5 +/- 6.6) {\mu}as/yr, consistent with, but more precise than, the HST result. For M33, we find ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M33 = (45.3 +/- 9.7, 26.3 +/- 7.3) {\mu}as/yr, agreeing with VLBA measurement within 1.5 sigma. These results support a first infall scenario for M33.</description>

      <title>Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed properties of W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) - W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation between B-fields and filaments.
  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF), PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.</description>

      <title>The End of the Road for Far-infrared Reddening Maps? Evidence for Reddening Errors Driven by Changes in PAH Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to $E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared emission.</description>

      <title>Deep Needlet: A CNN based full sky component separation method in Needlet space</title>

Abstract: One of the key steps in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is component separation to recover the CMB signal from multi-frequency observations contaminated by foreground emissions. Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum variance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to recover CMB. In this work, we develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recover CMB temperature map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over the full sky. The network operates on a multi-resolution representation of spherical data, capturing localised features in both pixel and harmonic space, and is designed to preserve the rotational invariance of the CMB signal.
  The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies, which include CMB temperature maps generated using cosmological parameters sampled within a 2$\sigma$ standard deviation around the Planck best-fit values. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit different foreground complexities. The recovered CMB temperature map closely follows the true signal with some residual leakage near the Galactic plane. The TT power spectrum is accurately reconstructed up to multipoles of approximately $\ell\sim 1100$. A minor residual systematics remain at smaller scales. Compared to the NILC method, the network shows reduced residual foreground contamination in the recovered CMB map.
  Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3 intensity data. The resulting CMB map is consistent with the CMB maps from the Planck legacy products, including those produced using the NILC and SMICA pipelines. This work demonstrates a powerful component separation method to clean spherical signal data from multi-resolution wavelet-filtered maps.</description>

      <title>The bulk motion of gas in the core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster</title>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM appears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating ("sloshing") motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. While the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ~&lt;120 km/s in the core, even within ~10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the AGN's influence on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.</description>

      <title>Constraining Statistical Isotropy using 21cm Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large length scales, typically $\gtrsim 70$Mpc. A detection of significant deviation would help us falsify the simplest models of inflation. In this regard, there are potential indications of departures from this principle, e.g., observations from WMAP and Planck show signs of a preferred direction in the temperature fluctuations known as hemispherical asymmetry in CMB. Phenomenologically, this has been studied using a dipole modulation model. In addition to this, a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain this anomaly. Some of these scenarios generate dipolar asymmetry or predict quadrupolar asymmetry in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we study both these asymmetries. To fulfill the objective, we employ 21cm intensity mapping technique post during post-reionization era, i.e., $z\lesssim 7$. We apply Fisher formalism to constrain dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy parameters using both 21cm power and bispectra and give forecasts for three intensity mapping surveys: SKA-Mid, HIRAX and PUMA. Although 21cm intensity mapping is a very promising cosmological probe, the signals are severely affected by foregrounds. To mitigate the foreground effects, we use foreground avoidance approach. For the interferometer mode of operation, we also include the wedge effect. From our analysis, we find that PUMA, on account of its high redshift range is able to constrain both dipolar and quadrupolar parameters to better than $\sim 10^{-3}$ for redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$. This is one order of magnitude better constraints as compared to those provided by the latest CMB surveys. We also find that as compared to power spectrum, the constraining power of bispectrum is more sensitive towards foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Upper Scorpius OB association with HERMES. I. The spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify &gt;1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.</description>

      <title>Searching for Accreting Compact Object Binaries in SRG/eROSITA eRASS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact object binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact object binary candidates in the SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 by combining their X-ray fluxes with Gaia photometry and ZTF time-domain observations. Candidates are selected based on their location in the "X-ray Main Sequence", a diagram incorporating their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, which suggest accretion-driven X-ray emission. We identify 22 candidates in eRASS1 catalog using a three-step selection process: (1) cross-matching to a unique Gaia optical counterpart within a 10" radius; (2) requiring X-ray-to-optical flux ratios exceeding the "X-ray Main Sequence"; and (3) detecting short-period variability in ZTF time-domain photometry. The resulting 22 candidates, including two previously confirmed compact object binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors jointly with time-domain photometry to uncover accreting compact object binaries. The approach is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact object binaries in the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

Abstract: With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>
