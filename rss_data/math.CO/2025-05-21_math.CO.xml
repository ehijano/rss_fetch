      <title>Exploring the Varchenko Determinant of Partial Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Varchenko matrix is known to have a well-structured determinant for complexes of oriented matroids (COMs). COMs can be characterized as partial cubes that do not have certain forbidden pc-minors. In this work, we generalize the Varchenko matrix and its determinant to partial cubes. We identify examples of partial cubes whose Varchenko determinants lack a clean factorization, as well as those that exhibit such a structure. These findings open the door for further research into the properties and potential characterizations of partial cubes with well-behaved Varchenko determinants.</description>

      <title>Connections Between Frames with Rational Eigensteps and Semistandard Young Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a correspondence between frames with rational eigensteps and semistandard Young tableaux (SSYT), via the relation assigning a Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern to a frame via the frame's eigensteps. We will identify how certain key structures in SSYTs correlate with particular frame properties. For example, the weight of an SSYT yields the sequence of norms of any compatible frame. Additionally, this correspondence leads to a novel way to construct the eigensteps of a frame coming solely from tableaux. This is an alternative to the Top Kill algorithm which may be viewed as a combinatorial reinterpretation of the algorithm. We further employ other combinatorial techniques such as the boxcomp method to generate a ``complement" SSYT. On the frame side, this corresponds to a tight frame's Naimark complement as well as to a generalization of the Naimark complement for non-tight frames. Further research points to an analysis of equiangular tight frames and their corresponding tableaux, as well as using more combinatorial operations to further analyze frames.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Supersymmetry for Coinvariant Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For finite groups $G$, we show that bosonic-fermionic coinvariant rings have a natural $U(\mathfrak{gl}(k|j)) \otimes \mathbb{C}[G]$-module structure. In particular, we show that their character series are a sum of super Schur functions $s_\lambda(\mathbf{q}/\mathbf{u})$ times irreducible characters of $G$ with universal coefficients, which do not depend on $k,j$. In the case where $G$ is the symmetric group with diagonal action, this proves the "Diagonal Supersymmetry" conjecture of Bergeron (2020).</description>

      <title>Cluster automorphism group of braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster automorphism group of a cluster variety was defined by Gekhtman--Shapiro--Vainshtein, and later studied by Lam--Speyer. Braid varieties are interesting affine algebraic varieties indexed by positive braid words. It was proved recently that braid varieties are cluster varieties. In this paper, we propose a description of the cluster automorphism group and its action on braid varieties, and compute several examples.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Tur\'an Problem for a Fixed Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral Tur\'an problem for trees. To avoid limiting our perspective to specific families of trees, we parametrize trees in terms of their unique bipartition. We say $T \in \mathcal{T}_{m,l+1}^{\delta}$ if $T$ is a tree of order $m$, where the order of the smaller partite set $A$ of $T$ is $l+1$, and $\delta$ is the minimum degree of the vertices in $A$. The motivation for this parametrization comes from the recent proof of the spectral Erd\H{o}s-S\'os conjecture. For a given fixed tree $T$, we describe $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,T)$ and consequently, bound $\mathrm{spex}(n,T)$ in terms of $m,l,\delta$ for that tree. Our approach combines spectral arguments with new results and constructions on embedding a tree $T \in \mathcal{T}_{m,l+1}^{\delta}$ into graphs of the form $\overline{K}_l \vee m S_{\delta}$. We give bounds on $\mathrm{spex}(n,T)$ within an error of $\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ and $\Theta(n^{-1})$ that are based on our embedding results for the given $T$.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs of graphs with large deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deficiency of a graph $G$, denoted by $\kd(G)$, is the number of vertices not saturated by a maximum matching. A bone $B_i$ is the tree obtained by attaching two pendent edges to each of the end vertices of a path $P_{i}$. The local independence number of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_l(G)$, is defines as the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains an induced star $K_{1,t}$. Motivated by the seminal works of Scott and Seymour~(2016), Chudnovsky et al. (2017, 2020) on finding special types of holes in graphs with large chromatic number and bounded clique number, we establish an analog result by finding special types of bones in graphs with large deficiency and bounded local independence number. Fujita et al. (2006) proved that $\kd(G)\le n-2$ if $G$ is a connected graph with $\alpha_l(G)&lt;n$ and containing no bones. We further establish exact extremal deficiency bounds for connected graphs with bounded local independence number that exclude specific bone configurations. An algorithm that constructs large matchings and establishes an upper bound on the deficiency is also provided.</description>

      <title>Strong odd colorings in graph classes of bounded expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and a graph class of bounded expansion $\mathscr{C}$, there exists some $c\in \mathbb{N}$ so that every graph from $\mathscr{C}$ admits a proper coloring with at most $c$ colors satisfying the following condition: in every ball of radius $d$, every color appears either zero times or an odd number of times. For $d=1$, this provides a positive answer to a question raised by Goetze, Klute, Knauer, Parada, Pe\~na, and Ueckerdt [ArXiv 2505.02736] about the boundedness of the strong odd chromatic number in graph classes of bounded expansion. The key technical ingredient towards the result is a proof that the strong odd coloring number of a sets system can be bounded in terms of its semi-ladder index, 2VC dimension, and the maximum subchromatic number among induced subsystems.</description>

      <title>Minimum blocking sets for families of partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $3$-partition of an $n$-element set $V$ is a triple of pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets $X,Y,Z$ such that $V=X\cup Y\cup Z$. We determine the minimum size $\varphi_3(n)$ of a set $\mathcal{E}$ of triples such that for every 3-partition $X,Y,Z$ of the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$, there is some $\{x,y,z\}\in \mathcal{E}$ with $x\in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z\in Z$. In particular, $$\varphi_3(n)=\left\lceil{\frac{n(n-2)}{3}}\right\rceil.$$ For $d&gt;3$, one may define an analogous number $\varphi_d(n)$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\varphi_d(n)$, and prove the following upper and lower bounds, for $d&gt;3$: $$\frac{2 n^{d-1}}{d!} -o(n^{d-1}) \leq \varphi_d(n) \leq \frac{0.86}{(d-1)!}n^{d-1}+o(n^{d-1}).$$</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Maker-Breaker Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on Maker-Breaker games arising from the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres problem in planar geometry. This classical problem asks how large a set in general position has to be to ensure the existence of $n$ points that are the vertices of a convex $n$-gon. Moreover, Erd\H{o}s further extended this problem by asking what happens if we also require that this $n$-gon has an empty interior. In a 2-player Maker-Breaker setting, this problem inspires two main games. In both games, Maker tries to obtain an empty convex $k$-gon, while Breaker tries to prevent her from doing so. The games differ only in which points can comprise the winning $k$-gons: in the monochromatic version the points of both players can make up a $k$-gon, while in the bichromatic version only Maker's points contribute to such a polygon. Both settings are studied in this paper. We show that in the monochromatic game, Maker always wins. Even in a biased game where Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round, for any constant $s \geq 1$, Maker has a winning strategy. In the bichromatic setting, Maker still wins whenever Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round for any constant $s&lt;2$. This settles an open problem posed by Aichholzer et al. (2019). Furthermore, we show that there are games that are not a lost cause for Breaker. Whenever $k\ge 8$ and Breaker is allowed to play 12 or more points per round, she has a winning strategy. We also consider the one-round bichromatic game (a.k.a.\ the offline version). In this setting, we show that Breaker wins if she can place twice as many points as Maker but if the bias is less than $2$, then Maker wins for large enough set of points.</description>

      <title>Subdivisions of Six-Blocks Cycles C(k,1,1,1,1,1) in Strong Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cycle C(k1,k2,...,kn) is the oriented cycle formed of n blocks of lengths k1,k2,...,kn-1 and kn respectively. In 2018 Cohen et al. conjectured that for every positive integers k1,k2,...,kn there exists a constant g(k1,k2,...,kn) such that every strongly connected digraph containing no subdivisions of C(k1,k2,...,kn) has a chromatic number at most g(k1,k2,...,kn). In their paper, Cohen et al. confirmed the conjecture for cycles with two blocks and for cycles with four blocks having all its blocks of length 1. Recently, the conjecture was proved for special types of four-blocks cycles. In this paper, we confirm Cohen et al.'s conjecture for all six-blocks cycles C(k,1,1,1,1,1). Precisely, for any integer k, we prove that every strongly connected digraph containing no subdivisions of C(k,1,1,1,1,1) has a chromatic number at most O(k), and we significantly reduce the chromatic number in case k=1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variety of new identities involving operators in the theory of wreath Macdonald polynomials. One such family of identities gives five-term relations, analogous to the one given by Garsia and Mellit for the modified Macdonald polynomials. As a consequence, we generate tableau formulas for wreath Macdonald Pieri coefficients, which give an incredibly quick way of computing their monomial expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result in design theory, known as Fisher's inequality, states that if every pair of clubs in a town shares the same number of members, then the number of clubs cannot exceed the number of inhabitants in the town. In this short note, we establish a $q$-analogue of Fisher's inequality. Additionally, we present a $q$-analogue of the oddtown theorem for the case when $q$ is an odd prime power.</description>

      <title>$4K_1$-free graph with the cop number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game of cops and robber is a two-player turn-based game played on a graph where the cops try to capture the robber. The cop number of a graph $G$, denoted by $c(G)$ is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber. For a given class of graphs ${\cal F}$, let $c({\cal F}):=\sup\{c(F)|F\in {\cal F}\}$, and let Forb$({\cal F})$ denote the class of ${\cal F}$-free graphs. We show that the complement of the Shrikhande graph is $(4K_1,C_{\ell}$)-free for any $\ell \geq 6$ and has the cop number~$3$. This provides a counterexample for the conjecture proposed by Sivaraman (arxiv, 2019) which states that if $G$ is $C_{\ell}$-free for all $\ell\ge 6$, then $c(G)\le 2$. This also gives a negative answer to the question posed by Turcotte (Discrete Math. 345:112660 (2022)) 112660. to check whether $c($Forb$(pK_1))=p-2$. Turcotte also posed the question to check whether $c($Forb$(pK_1+K_2))\leq p+1$, for $p\geq 3$. We prove that this result indeed holds. We also generalize this result for Forb$(pK_1+qK_2)$. Motivated by the results of Baird et al. (Contrib. Discrete Math. 9:70--84 (2014)) and Turcotte and Yvon (Discrete Appl. Math. 301:74--98 (2021)), we define the upper threshold degree and lower threshold degree for a particular class of graphs and show some computational advantage to find the cop number using these.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we establish the convexity and monotonicity for affine standard Lyndon words in all types, generalizing the $A$-type results of arXiv:2305.16299. We also derive partial results on the structure of imaginary standard Lyndon words and present a conjecture for their general form. Additionally, we provide computer code in Appendix which, in particular, allows to efficiently compute affine standard Lyndon words in exceptional types for all orders.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compare the index of ass-stability $\text{astab}(I)$ and the index of $\text{v}$-stability $\text{vstab}(I)$ of powers of a graded ideal $I$. We prove that $\text{astab}(I)=1\le\text{vstab}(I)$ for any graded ideal $I$ in a 2-dimensional polynomial ring, and that $\text{vstab}(I)$ can be any positive integer in this situation. Moreover, given any integers $a,b\ge1$, we construct a graded ideal $I$ in a $3(a+1)$-dimensional polynomial ring such that $(\text{astab}(I),\text{vstab}(I))=(a,b)$.</description>

      <title>Permutons from Demazure Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze several new families of permutons arising from random processes involving the Demazure product on the symmetric group. First, we consider Demazure products associated to random pipe dreams, generalizing the Grothendieck permutons introduced by Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov by replacing staircase shapes with arbitrary order-convex shapes. Using the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with geometric jumps, we prove precise scaling limit and fluctuation results for the associated height functions, showing that these models belong to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We then consider permutons obtained by applying deterministic sequences of bubble-sort operators to random initial permutations. We again provide precise descriptions of the limiting permutons. In a special case, we deduce the exact forms of the standard bubble-sort permutons, the supports of which were computed by DiFranco.
  A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of the Demazure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical semiring. This allows us to define a Demazure product on the set of permutons. We discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the number of inversions of the Demazure product of two independent uniformly random permutations of size $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$.</description>

      <title>First-order transducibility among classes of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several negative results about first-order transducibility for classes of sparse graphs:
  - for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the class of graphs of treewidth at most $t+1$ is not transducible from the class of graphs of treewidth at most $t$;
  - for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the class of graphs with Hadwiger number at most $t+2$ is not transducible from the class of graphs with Hadwiger number at most $t$; and
  - the class of graphs of treewidth at most $4$ is not transducible from the class of planar graphs.
  These results are obtained by combining the known upper and lower bounds on the weak coloring numbers of the considered graph classes with the following two new observations:
  - If a weakly sparse graph class $\mathscr D$ is transducible from a class $\mathscr C$ of bounded expansion, then for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every graph $G \in \mathscr D$ is a $k$-congested depth-$k$ minor of a graph $H^\circ$ obtained from some $H\in \mathscr C$ by adding a universal vertex.
  - The operations of adding a universal vertex and of taking $k$-congested depth-$k$ minors, for a fixed $k$, preserve the degree of the distance-$d$ weak coloring number of a graph class, understood as a polynomial in $d$.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any time in order to solve any of a family of problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership-width, that generalises both vertex-interval-membership-width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both parameters which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, matching, edge deletion to limit maximum reachability, and firefighting.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $T$ and a set of graphs $\mathcal{H}$, let $\mbox{ex}(n,T,\mathcal{H})$ denote the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graph. Recently, Alon and Frankl~(arXiv2210.15076) determined the exact value of $\mbox{ex}(n,K_2,\{K_{k+1},M_{s+1}\})$, where $K_{k+1}$ and $M_{s+1}$ are complete graph on $k+1$ vertices and matching of size $s+1$, respectively. Soon after, Gerbner~(arXiv2211.03272) continued the study by extending $K_{k+1}$ to general fixed graph $H$. In this paper, we continue the study of the function $\mbox{ex}(n, T,\{H,M_{s+1}\})$ when $T=K_r$ for $r\ge 3$. We determine the exact value of $\mbox{ex}(n,K_r,\{K_{k+1},M_{s+1}\})$ and give the value of $\mbox{ex}(n,K_r,\{H,M_{s+1}\})$ for general $H$ with an error term $O(1)$.</description>

Abstract: Using the sunflower method, we show that if $\theta \in (0,1) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a $O(n^{1/3})$-bounded $\theta$-intersecting family over $[n]$, then $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert = O(n)$, and that if $\mathcal{F}$ is $o(n^{1/3})$-bounded, then $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \leq (\frac{3}{2} + o(1))n$. This partially solves a conjecture of Balachandran, Mathew and Mishra that any $\theta$-intersecting family over $[n]$ has size at most linear in $n$, in the regime where we have no very large sets.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Counting Group Colorings in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jaeger et al. in 1992 introduced group coloring as the dual concept to group connectivity in graphs. Let $A$ be an additive Abelian group, $ f: E(G)\to A$ and $D$ an orientation of a graph $G$. A vertex coloring $c:V(G)\to A$ is an $(A, f)$-coloring if $c(v)-c(u)\ne f(e)$ for each oriented edge $e=uv$ from $u$ to $v$ with respect to $D$. Kochol recently introduced the assigning polynomial counting nowhere-zero chains in graphs and regular matroids. Motivated by Kochol's work, we define the $\alpha$-compatible graph and the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G, \alpha; k)$ at $k$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs, where $\alpha$ is an assigning of $G$ from its cycles to $\{0,1\}$. We prove that $P(G,\alpha;k)$ evaluates the number of $(A,f)$-colorings of $G$ for any Abelian group $A$ of order $k$ and $f:E(G)\to A$ such that the assigning $\alpha_{D,f}$ given by $f$ equals $\alpha$. Based on Kochol's work, we also show that $k^{-c(G)}P(G,\alpha;k)$ is a polynomial enumerating $(A,f)$-tensions and counting specific nowhere-zero chains.
  By extending the concept of broken cycle to broken compatible cycles, associated with any admissible assigning $\alpha$ of $G$, we demonstrate that the absolute value of the coefficient of $k^{|V(G)|-i}$ in $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that have $i$ edges and contain no broken $\alpha$-compatible cycles. This generalizes the Whitney's celebrated Broken Cycle Theorem. Based on the combinatorial explanation, we establish a unified order-preserving relation from admissible assignings to cycle-assigning polynomials. Finally, we show that for any admissible assigning $\alpha$ of $G$ with $\alpha(e)=1$ for every loop $e$ of $G$, the coefficients of the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ are nonzero and alternate in sign.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to two conjectures on Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. His conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the dual graph of any simple Venn diagram has a Hamilton cycle. In this work, we construct counterexamples to Winkler's conjecture for all $n\geq 6$. As part of this proof, we computed all 3.430.404 simple Venn diagrams with $n=6$ curves (even their number was not previously known), among which we found 72 counterexamples. While working on Winkler's conjecture, Pruesse and Ruskey considered the (multi)graph whose vertices are the crossings of the curves of a Venn diagram and curve segments between consecutive crossings form the edges. They proved that this graph has a Hamilton cycle for every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves, and conjectured that this also holds for non-simple diagrams. We construct counterexamples to this conjecture for all $n\geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph and $(2k+1)$ be a prime integer. Let each vertex of $G$ be colored using one of the $(2k+1)$ colors, say $R_1,R_2,...,R_{2k+1}$. If every vertex has an equal number of neighbors of each color, then the coloring is a $(2k+1)$-neighborhood balanced coloring. We establish a number of results for common families of graphs and present some families of graphs that have this property.</description>

Abstract: An upward planar order on an acyclic directed graph $G$ is a special linear extension of the edge poset of $G$ that satisfies the nesting condition. This order was introduced to combinatorially characterize upward plane graphs and progressive plane graphs (commonly known as plane string diagrams). In this paper, motivated by the theory of graphical calculus for monoidal categories, we establish a composition theory for upward planar orders. The main result is that the composition of upward planar orders is an upward planar order. This theory provides a practical method to calculate the upward planar order of a progressive plane graph or an upward plane graph.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we focus on various aspects of singular complex plane curves, mostly in the context of their homological properties and the associated combinatorial structures. We formulate some challenging open problems that can point to new directions in research, for example by introducing weak Ziegler pairs of curve arrangements. Moreover, we construct new examples of different Ziegler pairs, in both the classical and the weak sense, and present new geometric approaches to construction problems of singular plane curves.</description>

      <title>A cornering strategy for synchronizing a DFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the existence of short synchronizing words in deterministic finite automata (DFAs). In particular, we define a general strategy, which we call the cornering strategy, for generating short synchronizing words in well-structured DFAs. We show that a DFA is synchronizable if and only if this strategy can be applied.
  Using the cornering strategy, we prove that all DFAs consisting of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with bidirectional connected edge sets in which each edge $(\mathbf x, \mathbf y)$ with distinct endpoints is labeled $\mathbf y - \mathbf x$ are synchronizable. We also give sufficient conditions for such DFAs to have synchronizing words of length at most $(n-1)^2$ and thereby satisfy \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture. Using similar ideas, we improve upper bounds by Trahtman and Volkov on the length of shortest synchronizing words in aperiodic DFAs, in special cases where the DFAs in question have small diameter. Finally, we consider how the cornering strategy can be applied to the problem of simultaneously synchronizing a DFA $G$ to an initial state $u$ and a DFA $H$ to an initial state $v$. We do not assume that DFAs $G$ and $H$ or states $u$ and $v$ are related beyond sharing the same set of edge labels.</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new ``right-leaning'' leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree. This is equivalent to the statement that, in a corresponding inhomogeneous Bernouilli percolation model on a regular tree, the root cluster is stochastically increasing in its size.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. Revisiting spectral algorithms for Sparsest Cut, we present a novel, simple algorithm that combines eigenspace enumeration with a new algorithm for the Cut Improvement problem. The runtime of our algorithm is parametrized by a quantity that we call the cut dimension $\text{CD}_\varepsilon(G)$: the smallest $k$ such that the subspace spanned by the first $k$ Laplacian eigenvectors contains all but $\varepsilon$ fraction of a sparsest cut. Our algorithm matches the guarantees of prior methods based on the threshold-rank paradigm, while also extending beyond them. To illustrate this, we study its performance on low degree Cayley graphs over Abelian groups -- canonical examples of graphs with poor expansion properties. We prove that low degree Abelian Cayley graphs have small cut dimension, yielding an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the uniform Sparsest Cut of a degree-$d$ Cayley graph over an Abelian group of size $n$ in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$. Along the way to bounding the cut dimension of Abelian Cayley graphs, we analyze their sparse cuts and spectra, proving that the collection of $O(1)$-approximate sparsest cuts has an $\varepsilon$-net of size $\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$ and that the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ is bounded by $2^{O(d)}$. The latter bound is tight and improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a new pre-Lie algebra in the framework of symplectic groupoids and, in turn, introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <title>Tesler identities for wreath Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit formula for an operator that sends a wreath Macdonald polynomial to the delta function at a character associated to its partition. This allows us to prove many new results for wreath Macdonald polynomials, especially pertaining to reciprocity: Macdonald--Koornwinder duality, evaluation formulas, etc. Additionally, we initiate the study of wreath interpolation Macdonald polynomials, derive a plethystic formula for wreath $(q,t)$-Kostka coefficients, and present series solutions to the bispectral problem involving wreath Macdonald operators. Our approach is to use the eigenoperators for wreath Macdonald polynomials that have been produced from quantum toroidal and shuffle algebras.</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$. Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>
