      <title>Investigating the Optical and Thermodynamic Properties of 2D MoGe2P4 : Potential Material for Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the optical, thermodynamic and electronic properties of 2D MoGe2P4 from the first principle calculation. 2D MoGe2P4 demonstrates superior optical absorption in the NIR-I biological window (750 nm ~ 1000 nm) with a peak near 808 nm and excellent thermal conductivity (63 Wm-1K-1). Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and Heat simulations demonstrate that 2D MoGe2P4 possesses efficient photothermal conversion under low laser power (0.5 W/cm2) which is operated in 808nm. Theoretical investigation demonstrates, rapid temperature elevation ({\Delta}T = 24.8 {\deg}C) of the 2D MoGe2P4 within two minutes and photothermal stability over multiple laser cycles, achieving temperatures suitable for effective photothermal therapeutic applications. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an emerging tumor treatment technique that utilizes photothermal agents (PTAs) to convert near-infrared (NIR) light into localized heat for tumor ablation. To enhance biocompatibility, we analyzed the PEGylation of 2D MoGe2P4 nanosheets through molecular dynamics simulation. PEGylation at human body temperature was stable which signifies 2D MoGe2P4's prospect in therapeutic applications. This research highlights the potential of 2D MoGe2P4 as an emerging material for PTA, establishing a foundation for experimental and clinical trials.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Relationship Between Publication Bias and Chemical Reactivity with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A synthetic method's substrate tolerance and generality are often showcased in a "substrate scope" table. However, substrate selection exhibits a frequently discussed publication bias: unsuccessful experiments or low-yielding results are rarely reported. In this work, we explore more deeply the relationship between such publication bias and chemical reactivity beyond the simple analysis of yield distributions using a novel neural network training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning. By treating reported substrates as positive samples and non-reported substrates as negative samples, our contrastive learning strategy teaches a model to group molecules within a numerical embedding space, based on historical trends in published substrate scope tables. Training on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection$^{\text{TM}}$, spanning thousands of publications from 2010-2015, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings exhibit a correlation with physical organic reactivity descriptors through both intuitive visualizations and quantitative regression analyses. Additionally, these embeddings are applicable to various reaction modeling tasks like yield prediction and regioselectivity prediction, underscoring the potential to use historical reaction data as a pre-training task. This work not only presents a chemistry-specific machine learning training strategy to learn from literature data in a new way, but also represents a unique approach to uncover trends in chemical reactivity reflected by trends in substrate selection in publications.</description>
