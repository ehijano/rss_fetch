      <title>muT2-NMR: Micro-Scale Correlation Relaxometry for in-situ High-Pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the 157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched 157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 % increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %) and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.</description>

      <title>First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80 K. This work reports the first experimental characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The net photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is approximately 4.5 photoelectrons/keV after crosstalk correction, which is rather promising in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and Expected Performance for an hKLM at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent timing resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine learning has been integrated into the detector design process from the ground up. Detector design objectives are defined using Machine Learning based reconstruction and Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design. The highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for much more expensive detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system and a neutron hadron calorimeter. In EIC kinematics, charged particles are best measured through tracking rather than calorimetry, but the hKLM can identify and measure the momentum of neutral hadrons. The latter are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time of flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than that demonstrated for similar calorimeters read out with less granularity.</description>

      <title>First results of the NEXT-100 detector using $^{83m}$Kr decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report here the first results obtained with NEXT-100 using low-energy calibration data from $^{83m}$Kr decays, which allow mapping of the detector response in the active volume and monitoring of its stability over time. After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{\beta\beta}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.</description>
