      <title>Constructive Characterization and Recognition Algorithm for Grafts with a Connected Minimum Join</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum joins in a graft $(G, T)$, also known as minimum $T$-joins of a graph $G$, are said to be connected if they determine a connected subgraph of $G$. Grafts with a connected minimum join have gained interest ever since Middendorf and Pfeiffer showed that they satisfy Seymour's min-max formula for joins and $T$-cut packings; that is, in such grafts, the size of a minimum join is equal to the size of a maximum packing of $T$-cuts. In this paper, we provide a constructive characterization of grafts with a connected minimum join. We also obtain a polynomial time algorithm that decides whether a given graft has a connected minimum join and, if so, outputs one. Our algorithm has two bottlenecks; one is the time required to compute a minimum join of a graft, and the other is the time required to solve the single-source all-sink shortest path problem in a graph with conservative $\pm 1$-valued edge weights. Thus, our algorithm runs in $O(n(m + n\log n) )$ time. In the nondense case, it improves upon the time bound for this problem due to Seb\H{o} and Tannier that was introduced as an application of their results on metrics on graphs.</description>

      <title>Forbidden cycles in metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.05177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper by a superset of the authors it was proved that for every primitive 3-constrained space $\Gamma$ of finite diameter $\delta$ from Cherlin's catalogue of metrically homogeneous graphs, there exists a finite family $\mathcal F$ of $\{1,\ldots, \delta\}$-edge-labelled cycles such that a $\{1,\ldots, \delta\}$-edge-labelled graph is a subgraph of $\Gamma$ if and only if it contains no homomorphic images of cycles from $\mathcal F$. However, the cycles in the families $\mathcal F$ were not described explicitly as it was not necessary for the analysis of Ramsey expansions and the extension property for partial automorphisms.
  This paper fills this gap by providing an explicit description of the cycles in the families $\mathcal F$, heavily using the previous result in the process. Additionally, we explore the potential applications of this result, such as interpreting the graphs as semigroup-valued metric spaces or homogenizations of $\omega$-categorical $\{1,\delta\}$-edge-labelled graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bierbrauer-Friedman bound for orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize mixed-level orthogonal arrays in terms of algebraic designs in a special multigraph. We prove a mixed-level analog of the Bierbrauer-Friedman (BF) bound for pure-level orthogonal arrays and show that arrays attaining it are radius-1 completely regular codes (equivalently, intriguing sets, equitable 2-partitions, perfect 2-colorings) in the corresponding multigraph. For the case when the numbers of levels are powers of the same prime number, we characterize, in terms of multispreads, additive mixed-level orthogonal arrays attaining the BF bound. For pure-level orthogonal arrays, we consider versions of the BF bound obtained by replacing the Hamming graph by its polynomial generalization and show that in some cases this gives a new bound.
  Keywords: orthogonal array, algebraic t-design, completely regular code, equitable partition, intriguing set, Hamming graph, Bierbrauer-Friedman bound, additive codes.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>
