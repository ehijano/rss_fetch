      <title>VDAC Solvation Free Energy Calculation by a Nonuniform Size Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Ion Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) protein is the primary conduit for the regulated passage of ions and metabolites into and out of mitochondria. Calculating its solvation free energy is crucial for understanding its stability, function, and interactions within the cellular environment. In this paper, we introduce a total solvation free energy, $E$, which is the sum of electrostatic, ideal gas, and excess free energies, along with a non-polar energy to yield a zero of $E$ in the absence of charges. We develop numerical schemes for computing $E$ and update the current mesh generation package to accelerate the generation of tetrahedral meshes and improve the quality of meshes for computing $E$. By integrating these schemes and the updated mesh package with our non-uniform size modified Poisson-Boltzmann ion channel (nuSMPBIC), SMPBIC, and PBIC finite element packages, the PDB2PQR package, and the OPM database, we create the VDAC Solvation Free Energy Calculation (VSFEC) package. Using the VSFEC package, we perform comparison tests on the nuSMPBIC, SMPBIC, and PBIC models by using six VDAC proteins and various ionic solutions containing up to four ionic species, including ATP$^{4-}$ and Ca$^{2+}$. We also conduct tests with different neutral voltages and permittivity constants to explore the varying patterns of $E$. Our test results underscore the importance of considering non-uniform ionic size effects and demonstrate the high performance of the VSFEC package in calculating the solvation free energy of VDAC proteins.</description>

      <title>cryoSPHERE: Single-particle heterogeneous reconstruction from cryo EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional structure of a protein plays a key role in determining its function. Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often appear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to resolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images of a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as particles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a single, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep learning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from AlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to recover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is illustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Aligning Target-Aware Molecule Diffusion Models with Exact Energy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating ligand molecules for specific protein targets, known as structure-based drug design, is a fundamental problem in therapeutics development and biological discovery. Recently, target-aware generative models, especially diffusion models, have shown great promise in modeling protein-ligand interactions and generating candidate drugs. However, existing models primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of all drug candidates, which lacks effective steerability on the chemical quality of model generations. In this paper, we propose a novel and general alignment framework to align pretrained target diffusion models with preferred functional properties, named AliDiff. AliDiff shifts the target-conditioned chemical distribution towards regions with higher binding affinity and structural rationality, specified by user-defined reward functions, via the preference optimization approach. To avoid the overfitting problem in common preference optimization objectives, we further develop an improved Exact Energy Preference Optimization method to yield an exact and efficient alignment of the diffusion models, and provide the closed-form expression for the converged distribution. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that AliDiff can generate molecules with state-of-the-art binding energies with up to -7.07 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining strong molecular properties.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Alternative Medicine: A Novel Approach to Drug Discovery and Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIAltMed is a cutting-edge platform designed for drug discovery and repurposing. It utilizes Tanimoto similarity to identify structurally similar non-medicinal compounds to known medicinal ones. This preprint introduces AIAltMed, discusses the concept of `AI-driven alternative medicine,' evaluates Tanimoto similarity's advantages and limitations, and details the system's architecture. Furthermore, it explores the benefits of extending the system to include PubChem and outlines a corresponding implementation strategy.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for machine learning force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>DrugCLIP: Contrastive Drug-Disease Interaction For Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bringing a novel drug from the original idea to market typically requires more than ten years and billions of dollars. To alleviate the heavy burden, a natural idea is to reuse the approved drug to treat new diseases. The process is also known as drug repurposing or drug repositioning. Machine learning methods exhibited huge potential in automating drug repurposing. However, it still encounter some challenges, such as lack of labels and multimodal feature representation. To address these issues, we design DrugCLIP, a cutting-edge contrastive learning method, to learn drug and disease's interaction without negative labels. Additionally, we have curated a drug repurposing dataset based on real-world clinical trial records. Thorough empirical studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DrugCLIP method.</description>

      <title>APACE: AlphaFold2 and advanced computing as a service for accelerated discovery in biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of protein 3D structure from amino acid sequence is a computational grand challenge in biophysics, and plays a key role in robust protein structure prediction algorithms, from drug discovery to genome interpretation. The advent of AI models, such as AlphaFold, is revolutionizing applications that depend on robust protein structure prediction algorithms. To maximize the impact, and ease the usability, of these novel AI tools we introduce APACE, AlphaFold2 and advanced computing as a service, a novel computational framework that effectively handles this AI model and its TB-size database to conduct accelerated protein structure prediction analyses in modern supercomputing environments. We deployed APACE in the Delta and Polaris supercomputers, and quantified its performance for accurate protein structure predictions using four exemplar proteins: 6AWO, 6OAN, 7MEZ, and 6D6U. Using up to 300 ensembles, distributed across 200 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we found that APACE is up to two orders of magnitude faster than off-the-self AlphaFold2 implementations, reducing time-to-solution from weeks to minutes. This computational approach may be readily linked with robotics laboratories to automate and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Learning protein-ligand unbinding pathways via single-parameter community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecular complexes, e.g., of protein-ligand (un)binding, requires the understanding of paths such systems take between metastable states. In MD simulation data, paths are usually not observable per se, but need to be inferred from simulation trajectories. Here we present a novel approach to cluster trajectories based on a community detection algorithm that requires the definition of only a single free parameter. Using the streptavidin-biotin complex as benchmark system and the A\textsubscript{2a} adenosine receptor in complex with the inhibitor ZM241385 as an elaborate application, we demonstrate how such clusters of trajectories correspond to pathways, and how the approach helps in the identification of reaction coordinates for a considered (un)binding process.</description>

      <title>Structure-based drug design by denoising voxel grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present VoxBind, a new score-based generative model for 3D molecules conditioned on protein structures. Our approach represents molecules as 3D atomic density grids and leverages a 3D voxel-denoising network for learning and generation. We extend the neural empirical Bayes formalism (Saremi &amp; Hyvarinen, 2019) to the conditional setting and generate structure-conditioned molecules with a two-step procedure: (i) sample noisy molecules from the Gaussian-smoothed conditional distribution with underdamped Langevin MCMC using the learned score function and (ii) estimate clean molecules from the noisy samples with single-step denoising. Compared to the current state of the art, our model is simpler to train, significantly faster to sample from, and achieves better results on extensive in silico benchmarks -- the generated molecules are more diverse, exhibit fewer steric clashes, and bind with higher affinity to protein pockets. The code is available at https://github.com/genentech/voxbind/.</description>
