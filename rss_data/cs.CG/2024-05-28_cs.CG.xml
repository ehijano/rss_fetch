      <title>Surface reconstruction of sampled textiles via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the perception problem for garments using tools from computational topology: the identification of their geometry and position in space from point-cloud samples, as obtained e.g. with 3D scanners. We present a reconstruction algorithm based on a direct topological study of the sampled textile surface that allows us to obtain a cellular decomposition of it via a Morse function. No intermediate triangulation or local implicit equations are used, avoiding reconstruction-induced artifices. No a priori knowledge of the surface topology, density or regularity of the point-sample is required to run the algorithm. The results are a piecewise decomposition of the surface as a union of Morse cells (i.e. topological disks), suitable for tasks such as noise-filtering or mesh-independent reparametrization, and a cell complex of small rank determining the surface topology. This algorithm can be applied to smooth surfaces with or without boundary, embedded in an ambient space of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Weighted Dominance in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let P be a set of n weighted points, Q be a set of m unweighted points in the plane, and k a non-negative integer. We consider the problem of computing a subset $Q'\subseteq Q$ with size at most k such that the sum of the weights of the points of P dominated by at least one point in the set Q' is maximized. A point q in the plane dominates another point p if and only if $x(q)\ge x(p)$ and $y(q)\ge y(p)$, and at least one inequality is strict.
  We present a solution to the problem that takes O(n + m)-space and $O(k \min\{n+m, \frac{n}{k}+m^2\}\log m)$-time. We (conditionally) improve upon the existing result (the bounds of our solution are interesting when $m= o(\sqrt{n}))$.
  Moreover, we also present a simple algorithm solving the problem in $O(km^2+n\log m)$-time and $O(n+m)$-space. The bounds of the algorithm are interesting when $m= o(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Symmetric Self-Intersecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D printing of surfaces has become an established method for prototyping and visualisation. However, surfaces often contain certain degenerations, such as self-intersecting faces or non-manifold parts, which pose problems in obtaining a 3D printable file. Therefore, it is necessary to examine these degenerations beforehand. Surfaces in three-dimensional space can be represented as embedded simplicial complexes describing a triangulation of the surface. We use this combinatorial description, and the notion of embedded simplicial surfaces (which can be understood as well-behaved surfaces) to give a framework for obtaining 3D printable files. This provides a new perspective on self-intersecting triangulated surfaces in three-dimensional space. Our method first retriangulates a surface using a minimal number of triangles, then computes its outer hull, and finally treats non-manifold parts. To this end, we prove an initialisation criterion for the computation of the outer hull. We also show how symmetry properties can be used to simplify computations. Implementations of the proposed algorithms are given in the computer algebra system GAP4. To verify our methods, we use a dataset of self-intersecting symmetric icosahedra. Exploiting the symmetry of the underlying embedded complex leads to a notable speed-up and enhanced numerical robustness when computing a retriangulation, compared to methods that do not take advantage of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Reeb Complements for Exploring Inclusions Between Isosurfaces From Two Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes to integrate two Reeb graphs with the information of their isosurfaces' inclusion relation. As computing power evolves, there arise numerical data that have small-scale physics inside larger ones -- for example, small clouds in a simulation can be contained inside an atmospheric layer, which is further contained in an enormous hurricane. Extracting such inclusions between isosurfaces is a challenge for isosurfacing: the user would have to explore the vast combinations of isosurfaces $(f_1^{-1}(l_1), f_2^{-1}(l_2))$ from scalar fields $f_i: M(n) \to \mathbb{R}$, $i = 1, 2$, where $M$ is an $n$-dimensional domain manifold and $f_i$ are physical quantities, to find inclusion of one isosurface within another. For this, we propose the \textit{Reeb complement}, a topological space that integrates two Reeb graphs with the inclusion relation. The Reeb complement has a natural partition that classifies equivalent containment of isosurfaces. This is a handy characteristic that lets the Reeb complement serve as an overview of the inclusion relationship in the data. We also propose level-of-detail control of the inclusions through simplification of the Reeb complement. We demonstrate that the relationship of two independent scalar fields can be extracted by taking the product of Reeb graphs (which we call the Reeb product) and by then subtracting the projection of the Reeb space, which opens up a new possibility for feature analysis.</description>

      <title>Neural Slicer for Multi-Axis 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network-based computational pipeline as a representation-agnostic slicer for multi-axis 3D printing. This advanced slicer can work on models with diverse representations and intricate topology. The approach involves employing neural networks to establish a deformation mapping, defining a scalar field in the space surrounding an input model. Isosurfaces are subsequently extracted from this field to generate curved layers for 3D printing. Creating a differentiable pipeline enables us to optimize the mapping through loss functions directly defined on the field gradients as the local printing directions. New loss functions have been introduced to meet the manufacturing objectives of support-free and strength reinforcement. Our new computation pipeline relies less on the initial values of the field and can generate slicing results with significantly improved performance.</description>
