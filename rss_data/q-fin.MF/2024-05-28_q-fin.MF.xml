      <title>Intertemporal Cost-efficient Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to provide an intertemporal, cost-efficient consumption model that extends the consumption optimization inspired by the Distribution Builder, a tool developed by Sharpe, Johnson, and Goldstein. The Distribution Builder enables the recovery of investors' risk preferences by allowing them to select a desired distribution of terminal wealth within their budget constraints.
  This approach differs from the classical portfolio optimization, which considers the agent's risk aversion modeled by utility functions that are challenging to measure in practice. Our intertemporal model captures the dependent structure between consumption periods using copulas. This strategy is demonstrated using both the Black-Scholes and CEV models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and q-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. Finally, we investigate as an application the mean-variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic approach to continuous differentiability of optimal stopping boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the first probabilistic proof of continuous differentiability of time-dependent optimal boundaries in optimal stopping problems. The underlying stochastic dynamics is a one-dimensional, time-inhomogeneous diffusion. The gain function is also time-inhomogeneous and not necessarily smooth. Moreover, we include state-dependent discount rate and the time-horizon can be either finite or infinite. Our arguments of proof are of a local nature that allows us to obtain the result under more general conditions than those used in the PDE literature. As a byproduct of our main result we also obtain the first probabilistic proof of the link between the value function of an optimal stopping problem and the solution of the Stefan's problem.</description>

      <title>Cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12198v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature of risk measures, cash subadditivity was proposed to replace cash additivity, motivated by the presence of stochastic or ambiguous interest rates and defaultable contingent claims. Cash subadditivity has been traditionally studied together with quasi-convexity, in a way similar to cash additivity with convexity. In this paper, we study cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity. One of our major results is that a general cash-subadditive risk measure can be represented as the lower envelope of a family of quasi-convex and cash-subadditive risk measures. Representation results of cash-subadditive risk measures with some additional properties are also examined. The notion of quasi-star-shapedness, which is a natural analogue of star-shapedness, is introduced and we obtain a corresponding representation result.</description>
