      <title>DragVideo: Interactive Drag-style Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation models have shown their superior ability to generate photo-realistic video. However, how to accurately control (or edit) the video remains a formidable challenge. The main issues are: 1) how to perform direct and accurate user control in editing; 2) how to execute editings like changing shape, expression, and layout without unsightly distortion and artifacts to the edited content; and 3) how to maintain spatio-temporal consistency of video after editing. To address the above issues, we propose DragVideo, a general drag-style video editing framework. Inspired by DragGAN, DragVideo addresses issues 1) and 2) by proposing the drag-style video latent optimization method which gives desired control by updating noisy video latent according to drag instructions through video-level drag objective function. We amend issue 3) by integrating the video diffusion model with sample-specific LoRA and Mutual Self-Attention in DragVideo to ensure the edited result is spatio-temporally consistent. We also present a series of testing examples for drag-style video editing and conduct extensive experiments across a wide array of challenging editing tasks, such as motion, skeleton editing, etc, underscoring DragVideo can edit video in an intuitive, faithful to the user's intention manner, with nearly unnoticeable distortion and artifacts, while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. While traditional prompt-based video editing fails to do the former two and directly applying image drag editing fails in the last, DragVideo's versatility and generality are emphasized.

      <title>FlashAvatar: High-fidelity Head Avatar with Efficient Gaussian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FlashAvatar, a novel and lightweight 3D animatable avatar representation that could reconstruct a digital avatar from a short monocular video sequence in minutes and render high-fidelity photo-realistic images at 300FPS on a consumer-grade GPU. To achieve this, we maintain a uniform 3D Gaussian field embedded in the surface of a parametric face model and learn extra spatial offset to model non-surface regions and subtle facial details. While full use of geometric priors can capture high-frequency facial details and preserve exaggerated expressions, proper initialization can help reduce the number of Gaussians, thus enabling super-fast rendering speed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FlashAvatar outperforms existing works regarding visual quality and personalized details and is almost an order of magnitude faster in rendering speed.

      <title>GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.</description>

      <title>Dr.Hair: Reconstructing Scalp-Connected Hair Strands without Pre-training via Differentiable Rendering of Line Segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the film and gaming industries, achieving a realistic hair appearance typically involves the use of strands originating from the scalp. However, reconstructing these strands from observed surface images of hair presents significant challenges. The difficulty in acquiring Ground Truth (GT) data has led state-of-the-art learning-based methods to rely on pre-training with manually prepared synthetic CG data. This process is not only labor-intensive and costly but also introduces complications due to the domain gap when compared to real-world data. In this study, we propose an optimization-based approach that eliminates the need for pre-training. Our method represents hair strands as line segments growing from the scalp and optimizes them using a novel differentiable rendering algorithm. To robustly optimize a substantial number of slender explicit geometries, we introduce 3D orientation estimation utilizing global optimization, strand initialization based on Laplace's equation, and reparameterization that leverages geometric connectivity and spatial proximity. Unlike existing optimization-based methods, our method is capable of reconstructing internal hair flow in an absolute direction. Our method exhibits robust and accurate inverse rendering, surpassing the quality of existing methods and significantly improving processing speed.</description>
