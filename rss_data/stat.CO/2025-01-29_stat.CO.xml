      <title>Synchronized step Multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new algorithm for coupling Markov chains in a Markovian multilevel Monte Carlo estimator. We apply this approach for solving Bayesian inverse problems that consist of multiple model fidelities. The coupling methodology, termed as synchronized step correlation enhancement (SYNCE), is inspired by the concept of using common random numbers in Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. This methodology is shown to be more efficient and cost-effective than existing couplings in the literature. This improvement is achieved because SYNCE leads to higher correlation of samples obtained from level dependent posteriors than previous works. SYNCE is especially effective at coarse levels of the hierarchy where posteriors differ significantly from each other, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement in variance reduction. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by comparing it with existing algorithms on two simple examples taken from the literature. We then apply our methodology to a more complex example in the context of uncertainty quantification in subsurface flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties and drift parameter estimations of the ergodic double Heston model based on continuous-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double Heston model is one of the most popular option pricing models in financial theory. It is applied to several issues such that risk management and volatility surface calibration. This paper deals with the problem of global parameter estimations in this model. Our main stochastic results are about the stationarity and the ergodicity of the double Heston process. The statistical part of this paper is about the maximum likelihood and the conditional least squares estimations based on continuous-time observations; then for each estimation method, we study the asymptotic properties of the resulted estimators in the ergodic case.</description>

      <title>Goodness of Fit for Bayesian Generative Models with Applications in Population Genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In population genetics and other application fields, models with intractable likelihood are common. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or more generally Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods work by simulating instrumental data sets from the models under study and comparing them with the observed data set, using advanced machine learning tools for tasks such as model selection and parameter inference. The present work focuses on model criticism, and more specifically on Goodness of fit (GoF) tests, for intractable likelihood models. We introduce two new GoF tests: the pre-inference \gof tests whether the observed dataset is distributed from the prior predictive distribution, while the post-inference GoF tests whether there is a parameter value such that the observed dataset is distributed from the likelihood with that value. The pre-inference test can be used to prune a large set of models using a limited amount of simulations, while the post-inference test is used to assess the fit of a selected model. Both tests are based on the Local Outlier Factor (LOF, Breunig et al., 2000). This indicator was initially defined for outlier and novelty detection. It is able to quantify local density deviations, capturing subtleties that a more traditional k-NN-based approach may miss. We evaluated the performance of our two GoF tests on simulated datasets from three different model settings of varying complexity. We then illustrate the utility of these approaches on a dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the evaluation of complex evolutionary scenarios of modern human populations. Our dual-test GoF approach highlights the flexibility of our method: the pre-inference \gof test provides insight into model validity from a Bayesian perspective, while the post-inference test provides a more general and traditional view of assessing goodness of fit</description>
