      <title>Element Centralizers in the Centralizer Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Part group theory, part universal algebra, we explore the centralizer operation on a group. We show that this is a closure operator on the power set of the group and compare it to the well-known closure operator of `subgroup-generated-by'. We investigate properties of the centralizer lattice and consider the question of how generating sets should be addressed in this lattice. The element centralizers (centralizers of a single element) and, dually, their centers, play a fundamental role in the centralizer lattice. We show that every centralizer is a union of its `centralizer equivalence classes' over the element centers that it contains. We consider the M\"obius function on the poset of element centers and obtain some new results regarding centralizers in a $p$-group.</description>

      <title>Growth and Language Complexity of Potentially Positive Elements of Free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word in a free group is called ``potentially positive'' if it is automorphic to an element which is written with only positive exponents. We will develop automata to analyze properties of potentially positive words. We will use these to give new bounds on the asymptotic growth of potentially positive elements in free groups of 2 to 7 generators. We prove the bounds for $F_2$ are tight, giving the growth function up to a constant multiplier. We use the same tools to show that certain restricted automata cannot recognize the set of potentially positive elements.</description>

      <title>Snowflake groups and conjugator length functions with non-integer exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit novel geometric phenomena in the study of conjugacy problems for discrete groups. We prove that the snowflake groups $B_{pq}$, indexed by pairs of positive integers $p&gt;q$, have conjugator length functions $\text{CL}(n)\simeq n$ and annular Dehn functions $\text{Ann}(n) \simeq n^{2\alpha}$, where $\alpha = \log_2(2p/q)$. Then, building on $B_{pq}$, we construct groups $\tilde{B}_{pq}^+$, for which $\text{CL}(n)\simeq n^{\alpha+1}$. Thus the conjugator length spectrum and the spectrum of exponents of annular Dehn functions are both dense in the range $[2,\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that any isometric action of a residually finite group admits approximate local finite models. As a consequence, if $G$ is residually finite, every isometric $G$-action embeds isometrically into a metric ultraproduct of finite isometric $G$-actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every Cuntz--Krieger groupoid, we show that there is a topologically free boundary action of the outer automorphism group of its topological full group on the Hilbert cube. In particular, these outer automorphism groups, including the outer automorphism groups of all Higman--Thompson groups, are C*-simple.</description>

      <title>Lie rings related to the $p$-groups of maximal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lazard correspondence induces a close relation between the $p$-groups of maximal class and a certain type of Lie ring constructed from $p$-adic number fields. Our aim here is to investigate such Lie rings. In particular, we show that they are always finite. It then follows that they are nilpotent of small class. These results close an important gap in (Eick, Komma \&amp; Saha 2025).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. This leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>On the Positivity of Dihedral Branching Coefficients of the Symmetric and Alternating Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine precisely when the branching coefficients arising from the restriction of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ to the dihedral subgroup $D_n$ are nonzero, and we establish uniform linear lower bounds outside a finite exceptional family. As a consequence, we recover and substantially generalize known positivity results for cyclic subgroups $C_n \leq S_n$. Analogous results are obtained for the alternating group $A_n$.</description>

      <title>The operad associated to a crossed simplicial group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study structured enhancement of the notion of a crossed simplicial group, which we call an operadic crossed simplicial group. We show that with each operadic crossed simplicial group one can associate a certain operad in groupoids. We demonstrate that symmetric and braid crossed simplicial groups can be made into operadic crossed simplicial groups in a natural way. For these two examples, we show that our construction of the associated operad recovers the $E_\infty$-operad and the $E_2$-operad respectively. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through two main applications: a generalized bar construction that specializes to Fiedorowicz's symmetric and braided bar constructions, and an identification of the associated group-completed monads with Baratt-Priddy-Quillen type spaces.</description>

      <title>Left reductive regular semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an ideal structure theory for the class of left reductive regular semigroups and apply it to several subclasses of popular interest. In these classes we observe that the right ideal structure of the semigroup is `embedded' inside the left ideal one, and so we can construct these semigroups starting with only one object (unlike in other more general cases). To this end, we introduce an upgraded version of Nambooripad's normal category as our building block, which we call a connected category.
  The main theorem of the paper describes a category equivalence between the category of left (and right) reductive regular semigroups and the category of connected categories. Then, we specialise our result to describe constructions of L- (and R-) unipotent semigroups, right (and left) regular bands, inverse semigroups and arbitrary regular monoids. Finally, we provide concrete (and rather simple) descriptions to the connected categories that arise from finite transformation semigroups, linear transformation semigroups (over a finite dimensional vector space) and symmetric inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>Pullbacks and intersections in categories of graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a categorical framework for studying graphs of groups and their morphisms, with emphasis on pullbacks. More precisely, building on classical work by Serre and Bass, we give an explicit construction of the so-called $\mathbb{A}$-product of two morphisms into a graph of groups $\mathbb{A}$ -- a graph of groups which, within the appropriate categorical setting, captures the intersection of subgroups of the fundamental group of $\mathbb{A}$. We show that, in the category of pointed graphs of groups, pullbacks always exist and correspond precisely to pointed $\mathbb{A}$-products. In contrast, pullbacks do not always exist in the category of unpointed graphs of groups. However, when they do exist, and we show that it is the case, in particular, under certain acylindricity conditions, they are again closely related to $\mathbb{A}$-products. We trace, all along, the parallels with Stallings' classical theory of graph immersions and coverings, in relation to the study of the subgroups of free groups. Our results are useful for studying intersections of subgroups of groups that arise as fundamental groups of graphs of groups. As an example, we carry out an explicit computation of a pullback which results in a classification of the Baumslag--Solitar groups with the finitely generated intersection property.</description>

      <title>A classification of vertex-reversing maps with Euler characteristic coprime to the edge number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A map is \emph{vertex-reversing} if it admits an arc-transitive automorphism group with dihedral vertex stabilizers. This paper classifies solvable vertex-reversing maps whose edge number and Euler characteristic are coprime. The classification establishes that such maps comprise three families: $\D_{2n}$-maps, $(\ZZ_{m}{:}\D_{4})$-maps, and $(\ZZ_{m}.\S_4)$-maps, where $m$ is odd. Our classification is based on an explicit characterization obtained of finite almost Sylow-cyclic groups, associated with a shorter proof and explicit description of generators and relations.</description>

      <title>Every finite group is represented by a finite incidence geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between finite groups and incidence geometries through their automorphism structures. Building upon classical results on the realizability of groups as automorphism groups of graphs, we develop a general framework to represent pairs of finite groups $(G, H)$, where $H \trianglelefteq G$, as pairs of correlation--automorphism groups of suitable incidence geometries. Specifically, we prove that for every such pair $(G, H)$, there exists a finite incidence geometry $\Gamma$ satisfying that the pair $(\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma), \operatorname{Aut}_I(\Gamma))$ of correlation--automorphism groups of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $(G, H)$. Our construction proceeds in two main steps: first, we realize $(G, H)$ as the correlation and automorphism groups of an incidence system; then, we refine this system into a genuine incidence geometry preserving the same pair of automorphisms groups. We also provide explicit examples, including a family of geometries realizing $(S_n, A_n)$ for all $n \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Symbolic substitution systems beyond abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.15210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we construct the first examples of strongly aperiodic linearly repetitive Delone sets in non-abelian Lie groups by means of symbolic substitutions. In particular, we find such sets in all $2$-step nilpotent Lie groups with rational structure constants such as the Heisenberg group. More generally, we consider the class of $1$-connected nilpotent Lie groups whose Lie algebras admit a rational form and a derivation with positive eigenvalues. Any group in this class admits a lattice which is invariant under a natural family of dilations, and this allows us to construct primitive non-periodic symbolic substitutions. We show that, as in the abelian case, the associated subshift (and hence the induced Delone dynamical system) is minimal, uniquely ergodic and weakly aperiodic and consists of linearly repetitive configurations. In the $2$-step nilpotent case, it is even strongly aperiodic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /L^G$ is a finite extension. We show that the irreducible semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of the map $G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(L)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.</description>
