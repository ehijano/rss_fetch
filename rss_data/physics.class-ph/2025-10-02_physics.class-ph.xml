      <title>Multi-scale friction coefficient: From roughness to system computation using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of surface defects (roughness, surface imperfections, profiles, etc.) in a contact inevitably leads to the modification of its local properties, such as the coefficient of friction. In railway wheelsets, this surface condition is crucial as it dictates appropriate fatigue design for the final use. However, these local phenomena are not well understood and require a real step back. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a multiscale numerical strategy to better understand these phenomena. The multiscale strategy is divided into two steps. Initially, an analysis by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling the interaction of generated rough surfaces is carried out to determine the coefficient of friction. In a second step, the results of DEM are introduced into a structural calculation where the enrichment of the coefficient of friction is done on each finite element contact. Given the wide variety of potential surface defects (size, distribution, height, etc.), a large number of DEM simulations is performed. A specially developed deep learning program is then used to account for these dispersions. The application targeted in this paper is the fitting of a wheel on a railway axle.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>

Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
