      <title>Fragility Modeling of Power Grid Infrastructure for Addressing Climate Change Risks and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resilience of electric power grids is threatened by natural hazards. Climate-related hazards are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Statistical analyses clearly demonstrate a rise in the number of incidents (power failures) and their consequences in recent years. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand and quantify the resilience of the infrastructure to external stressors, which is essential for developing efficient climate change adaptation strategies. To accomplish this, robust fragility and other vulnerability models are necessary. These models are employed to assess the level of asset damage and to quantify losses for given hazard intensity measures. In this context, a comprehensive literature review is carried out to shed light on existing fragility models specific to the transmission network, distribution network, and substations. The review is organized into three main sections: damage assessment, fragility curves, and recommendations for climate change adaptation. The first section provides a comprehensive review of past incidents, their causes, and failure modes. The second section reviews analytical and empirical fragility models, emphasizing the need for further research on compound and non-compound hazards, especially windstorms, floods, lightning, and wildfires. Finally, the third section examines risk mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of climate change. This review aims to improve the understanding of approaches to enhance the resilience of power grid assets in the face of climate change. These insights are valuable to various stakeholders, including risk analysts and policymakers, who are involved in risk modeling and developing adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Research Power Ranking: Adapting the Elo System to Quantify Scientist Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an original model for assessing scientific productivity, research power ranking, RPR, which is based on the adaptation of the Elo rating system to the context of scientific activity. Unlike traditional scientometric indicators, RPR accounts for the dynamics, multidimensionality, and relativity of research power. The model comprises three components fundamental, applied, and commercial activity each represented by a separate rating and updated on the basis of probabilistic scientific games analogous to chess matches. The scientific rating of each researcher is calculated as a weighted sum of the components, allowing the model to reflect not only their current position but also their career trajectory, including phase transitions, breakthroughs, and changes in scientific style. Numerical simulations were conducted for both the individual trajectories and population level distributions of the researchers. Phase diagrams were constructed, and a typology of scientific styles was formulated. The results demonstrate that RPR can serve as a universal tool for objective assessment, strategic planning, and visualization of scientific reputation in both academic and applied environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of quantum models to economic growth theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional economic growth theories, grounded in deterministic and often linear frameworks, fail to adequately capture the inherent uncertainty, non-commutativity, and complex interdependencies of modern economies. This paper proposes a novel approach by transposing fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics-such as superposition, operator algebra, and path integrals-into the realm of macroeconomic modeling. Within this quantum framework, core economic variables (capital, labor, and technological progress) are redefined as non-commuting operators acting on Hilbert spaces, and the state of the economy is represented as a dynamic wave function governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The evolution of this economic wave function follows a generalized Schr{\"o}dinger equation, developed here through Dyson series and Magnus expansions. We also define a quantum production function as the expected value of a composite operator, capturing the probabilistic nature of economic output. By integrating uncertainty relations analogous to Heisenberg's principle, and modeling economic fluctuations via Langevin dynamics, we extend the model to include dissipation, feedback loops, and non-linear interactions between variables. Finally, a Feynman path integral formalism is constructed to provide an alternative trajectory-based interpretation of economic dynamics. This quantum-inspired framework offers a rigorous and flexible methodology to rethink macroeconomic modeling under radical uncertainty, with potential applications in dynamic policy simulations and innovation-driven growth.</description>

      <title>Navigating through Educational Pathways to Political Participation: A Multi-theoretical Exploration of Voting Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the determinants of voting behavior by focusing on the direct effect of educational attainment, sociodemographic characteristics, partisan identity, and political ideology on the intention to vote, registration, and turnout. We use the cumulative CCES dataset to explore voting behavior for the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections and the 2016 and 2020 general elections. We propose a new Voting Engagement Index (VEI) to assess these factors' cumulative impact on electoral participation. Our analysis shows that education consistently motivates voting behavior, while gender, race, and ethnicity significantly shape engagement levels. Mainly, Black and Middle Eastern Americans exhibit higher voting engagement, whereas Native Americans and females display lower odds of voting engagement. Although Native Americans and women express a clear intention to vote in upcoming elections with increased attainment, the intention is not fully realized in voter registration and voting during midterms and general elections. Income and home ownership also become apparent as strong predictors of voter engagement. This research contributes to understanding the changing aspects of voter motivation and participation, with implications for grassroots-level mobilization, including unheard voting voices in U.S. elections, more inclusive and just voting policies and future electoral studies.</description>

      <title>The environmental value of transport infrastructure in the UK: an EXIOBASE analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to calculate a project s environmental value are described: (a) process-based, (b) hybrid, (c) pseudo, (d) simplified, and (e) parametric. This paper discusses in detail and compares the two methods with the least inherent uncertainty: process-based LCA (a bottom-up methodology involving mapping and characterising all processes associated with all life cycle phases of a project) and a hybrid LCA (the EXIOBASE analysis, which incorporates top-down economic input output analysis and is a wider sector-by-sector approach). The bottom-up nature of process-based LCA, which quantifies the environmental impacts for each process in all life cycle phases of a project, is particularly challenging when applied to the evaluation of infrastructure as a whole. Conversely, combining the environmental impact information provided in EXIOBASE tables with the corresponding input output tables allows decision makers to more straightforwardly choose to invest in infrastructure that supports positive environmental outcomes. Employing LCA and a bespoke model using Pearson s correlation coefficient to capture environmental interdependencies between the transport sector and the other four economic infrastructures showed the transport and energy sectors to be most closely linked. Both integrated planning and innovative technologies are needed to radically reduce adverse environmental impacts and enhance sustainability across transport, waste, water, and communication sectors.</description>

      <title>Where do Germany's electricity imports come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Germany's electricity trade balance shifted from net exports to net imports for the first time since 2002, resulting in an increasing discussion of these imports in the public debate. This study discusses different data driven approaches for the analysis of Germany's cross-border trade, with a focus on the methodological challenges to determine the origin of imported electricity within the framework of European electricity market coupling. While scheduled commercial flows from ENTSO-E are often used as indicators, generally these do not correspond to bilateral exchanges between different market actors. In particular, for day-ahead market coupling only net positions have an economically reasonable interpretation, and scheduled commercial exchanges are defined through ex-post algorithmic calculations. Any measure of the origin of electricity imports thus depends on some underlying interpretation and corresponding method, ranging from local flow patterns to correlations in net positions. To illustrate this dependence on methodological choices, we compare different approaches to determine the origin of electricity imports for hourly European power system data for 2024.</description>

      <title>Triadic Closure-Heterogeneity-Harmony GCN for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction aims to estimate the likelihood of connections between pairs of nodes in complex networks, which is beneficial to many applications from friend recommendation to metabolic network reconstruction. Traditional heuristic-based methodologies in the field of complex networks typically depend on predefined assumptions about node connectivity, limiting their generalizability across diverse networks. While recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches capture global structural features effectively, they often neglect node attributes and intrinsic structural relationships between node pairs. To address this, we propose TriHetGCN, an extension of traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates explicit topological indicators -- triadic closure and degree heterogeneity. TriHetGCN consists of three modules: topology feature construction, graph structural representation, and connection probability prediction. The topology feature module constructs node features using shortest path distances to anchor nodes, enhancing global structure perception. The graph structural module integrates topological indicators into the GCN framework to model triadic closure and heterogeneity. The connection probability module uses deep learning to predict links. Evaluated on nine real-world datasets, from traditional networks without node attributes to large-scale networks with rich features, TriHetGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming mainstream methods. This highlights its strong generalization across diverse network types, offering a promising framework that bridges statistical physics and graph deep learning.</description>

      <title>Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''</description>

      <title>Similarity matrix average for aggregating multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology based on averaging similarity matrices with the aim of integrating the layers of a multiplex network into a single monoplex network. Multiplex networks are adopted for modelling a wide variety of real-world frameworks, such as multi-type relations in social, economic and biological structures. More specifically, multiplex networks are used when relations of different nature (layers) arise between a set of elements from a given population (nodes). A possible approach for investigating multiplex networks consists in aggregating the different layers in a single network (monoplex) which is a valid representation -- in some sense -- of all the layers. In order to obtain such an aggregated network, we propose a theoretical approach -- along with its practical implementation -- which stems on the concept of similarity matrix average. This methodology is finally applied to a multiplex similarity network of statistical journals, where the three considered layers express the similarity of the journals based on co-citations, common authors and common editors, respectively.</description>
