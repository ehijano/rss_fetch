      <title>Semialgebraic Lipschitz equivalence polynomial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classification of quasihomogeneous polynomials in two variables with real coefficients under semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz equivalence in a neighborhood of the origin in ${\mathbb R}^2$. Building on the work of Birbrair, Fernandes, and Panazzolo, our approach is based on reducing the problem to the Lipschitz classification of associated single-variable polynomial functions, called height functions. We establish conditions under which semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz equivalence of quasihomogeneous polynomials corresponds to the Lipschitz equivalence of their height functions. To achieve this, we develop the theory of $\beta$-transforms and inverse $\beta$-transforms. As an application, we examine a family of quasihomogeneous polynomials previously used by Henry and Parusi\'nski to show that the bi-Lipschitz equivalence of analytic function germs $({\mathbb R}^2,0)\rightarrow({\mathbb R},0)$ admits continuous moduli. Our results show that semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz equivalence of real quasihomogeneous polynomials in two variables also admits continuous moduli.</description>

      <title>$K$-theoretic pullbacks for Lagrangians on derived critical loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a regular function $\phi$ on a smooth stack, and a $(-1)$-shifted Lagrangian $M$ on the derived critical locus of $\phi$, under fairly general hypotheses, we construct a pullback map from the Grothendieck group of coherent matrix factorizations of $\phi$ to that of coherent sheaves on $M$. This map satisfies a functoriality property with respect to the composition of Lagrangian correspondences, as well as the usual bivariance and base-change properties.
  We provide three applications of the construction, one in the definition of quantum $K$-theory of critical loci (Landau-Ginzburg models), paving the way to generalize works of Okounkov school from Nakajima quiver varieties to quivers with potentials, one in establishing a degeneration formula for $K$-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas theory of local Calabi-Yau 4-folds, the other in confirming a $K$-theoretic version of Joyce-Safronov conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Picard numbers of moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic phenomena of moduli spaces of higher rank stable sheaves on algebraic surfaces, we study the Picard number of the moduli space of one-dimensional stable sheaves supported in a sufficiently positive divisor class on a surface. We give an asymptotic lower bound of the Picard number in general. In some special cases, we show that this lower bound is attained based on the geometry of moduli spaces of stable pairs and relative Hilbert schemes of points. Additionally, we discuss several related questions and provide examples where the asymptotic irreducibility of the moduli space fails, highlighting a notable distinction from the higher rank case.</description>

      <title>Bounds and formulas for residues of singular holomorphic foliations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a one dimensional holomorphic foliation with isolated singularities, leaving invariant a singular complete interserction $V = \bigcap_{\lambda =1}^kD_{\lambda}$ of $k$ hypersurfaces $D_{\lambda}$. We proved formulas to calculate the GSV and Schwartz indices of singularities of $\mathcal{F}$ and we find bounds for these indices. As applications, we provide some results related to Poincar\'e's problem for foliations on the prejective space $\mathbb{P}$.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{G}_m$-Equivariant Degenerations of del Pezzo Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study special $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant degenerations of a smooth del Pezzo surface $X$ induced by valuations that are log canonical places of $(X,C)$ for a nodal anti-canonical curve $C$. We show that the space of special valuations in the dual complex of $(X,C)$ is connected and admits a locally finite partition into sub-intervals, each associated to a $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant degeneration of $X$. This result is an example of higher rank degenerations of log Fano varieties studied by Liu-Xu-Zhuang, and verifies a global analog of a conjecture on Koll\'ar valuations raised by Liu-Xu. For del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities, we obtain a weaker statement about the space of special valuations associated to a normal crossing complement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the log version of the prismatic Dieudonn\'{e} theory established by Ansch\"{u}tz-Le Bras. By applying this result to the integral toroidal compactification of a Shimura variety of Hodge type, we extend the prismatic realization, originally constructed by Imai-Kato-Youcis, to the compactification. This extension enables us to prove Lovering's conjecture on $p$-adic comparison isomorphisms for Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by certain topics in local deformation theory, we primarily utilize F. Campana's methods to investigate how far a fiberwise Fujiki family is from being locally Moishezon and how far a fiberwise K\"ahler family is from being locally projective.
  We investigate these questions from two main perspectives: cohomological data and global semi-positivity data on the total space.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic 4-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian RP^2s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as hypersurfaces of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigation on S^1-invariant contact structures also suggests there should be a universal upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the singularity).</description>

      <title>B-brane transport in nonabelian GLSMs for $K_{Gr(2,N)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of B-branes in a class of nonabelian GLSMs realizing the canonical line bundle $K_{Gr(2,N)}$ in their geometric phase. By analysing the hemisphere partition function, i.e. B-brane central charge, we propose a grade restriction rule and the corresponding window categories for a specific class of paths between phases. We find very striking differences between the cases of N even and N odd. In particular, for the case of N even, we suggest that more than one window category can be possible, for a fixed path. A detailed computation of the open Witten index and some monodromies provides evidence for our proposal for window categories. In addition, we make some remarks about B-branes on the the strongly coupled phase, for the case $N=4$, based on our window proposal.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions of qKZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [MV] the difference qKZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$ and a family of polynomial solutions of the qKZ equations modulo $p$ was constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper, we study in detail the first family of nontrivial example of the qKZ equations in characteristic $p$. We describe all solutions of these qKZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We also prove a Lagrangian property (called the orthogonality property) of the subbundle of the qKZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections. This paper extends the results of [VV1] on the differential KZ equations to the difference qKZ equations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a work of Fu-So-Song, we associate a symmetric matrix $A$ to a plane vector sequence $v$ and give a formula to find the signature of $A$ in terms of the sequence $v$. When $A$ is nonsingular, we interpret the relation between $A$ and $A^{-1}$ from a topological viewpoint. Finally, we associate an omnioriented quasitoric orbifold $X$ of real dimension four to the sequence $v$ and show that $A^{-1}$ is the intersection matrix of the characteristic suborbifolds of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that any localisation of triangulated categories induces (up to an equivalence) a localisation of abelian categories when one passes to their abelianisations. From this one obtains for any enlargement of Grothendieck universes an example of an abelian category and a Serre subcategory within the smaller universe such that the corresponding quotient does only exist within the bigger universe. The second part of this note provides an analogue for the abelian hull of an arbitrary category.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting real ramified coverings of the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ by real Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, where the ramification profiles over $0$ and $\infty$ are $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively, and the ramification profiles over other real branch points consist of either $(3,1,\ldots,1)$ or $(2,1,\ldots,1)$. The solutions to this problem are called real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and are denoted by $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$.
  We apply a modified version of the tropical computaton developed by Markwig and Rau for real Hurwitz numbers to compute $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$. Based on a generalization of Rau's zigzag number, we introduce a combinatorial invariant that serves as the lower bound for $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$. We obtain a uniform lower bound for the large degree and large genus logarithmic asymptotics of these combinatorial invariants. Our uniform lower bound implies the following results. (1). We establish a uniform lower bound for the large degree and large genus logarithmic asymptotics of $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts. In particular, we give a partial answer to an open question proposed by Dubrovin, Yang and Zagier on the uniform bound for simple Hurwitz numbers. (2). We obtain the logarithmic equivalence between $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts as the degree tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added. (3). As the genus tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added, we show that the logarithms of $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Algebraic geometry of the multilayer model of the fractional quantum Hall effect on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1993 Keski-Vakkuri and Wen introduced a model for the fractional quantum Hall effect based on multilayer two-dimensional electron systems satisfying quasi-periodic boundary conditions. Such a model is essentially specified by a choice of a complex torus $E$ and a symmetric positively definite matrix $K$ of size $g$ with positive integral coefficients.
  The space of the corresponding wave functions turns out to be $\delta$-dimensional, where $\delta$ is the determinant of $K$. We construct a hermitian holomorphic bundle of rank $\delta$ on the abelian variety $A$ (which is the $g$-fold product of the torus $E$ with itself), whose fibres can be identified with the space of wave function of Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. A rigorous construction of this "magnetic bundle" involves the technique of Fourier-Mukai transforms on abelian varieties. This bundle turns out to be simple and semi-homogeneous. This bundle can be equipped with two different (and natural) hermitian metrics: the one coming from the center-of-mass dynamics and the one coming from the Hilbert space of the underlying many-body system. We prove that the canonical Bott-Chern connection of the first hermitian metric is always projectively flat and give sufficient conditions for this property for the second hermitian metric.</description>

      <title>Tangent Weights and Invariant Curves in Type A Bow Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04973v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete classification of torus-invariant curves in Cherkis bow varieties of type A. We develop combinatorial codes for compact and noncompact invariant curves involving the butterfly diagrams, Young diagrams, and binary contingency tables. As a key intermediate step, we also develop a novel tangent weight formula. Finally, we apply this new machinery to example bow varieties to demonstrate how to obtain their 1-skeletons (union of fixed points and invariant curves).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the complement to the caustic of a stable Lagrangian map germ of type $E_6^\pm$ has seven connected components, six of which are contractible and one is homotopy equivalent to a circle. The inverse image of the noncontractible component under this map has three connected components. The restriction of the map to one of them is a two-sheeted covering; the restriction to each of the other two is a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>The Rank of the Normal Functions of the Ceresa and Gross--Schoen Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result is that when the genus is at least 3, the rank of the normal function function of the Ceresa cycle over the moduli space of curves has maximal rank. This result was proved independently by Z. Gao and S.-W. Zhang (arXiv:2407.01304) by different methods. In genus 3 we show that the Green--Griffiths invariant of this normal function is a Teichmuller modular form of weight (4,0,-1) and use this to show that the rank of the Ceresa normal function is exactly 1 along the hyperelliptic locus.</description>

      <title>On solvability of linear differential equations in finite terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solvability of linear differential equations over a differential field~$K$. We introduce a class of special differential field extensions, which widely generalizes the classical class of extensions of differential fields by integrals and by exponentials of integrals and which has similar properties. We announce the following result: if a linear differential equation over $K$ can not be solved by generalized quadratures, then no special extension can help solve it. In the paper we prove a weaker version of this result in which we consider only pure transcendental extensions of $K$. Our paper is self-contained and understandable for beginners. It demonstrates the power of Liouville's original approach to problems of solvability of equations in finite terms.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f,0}$ for homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $-{n\over d}$ is a root of $b_{f,0}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong topological monodromy conjecture for arrangements. U. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. We also give some essential indecomposable homogeneous polynomials $f$ such that $-{n\over d}$ is not a root of $b_{f,0}$. This leads to a conjectural sufficient condition for $b_{f,0}(-{n\over d})=0$.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e polynomials of moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on the projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M_{\beta}$ denote the moduli space of stable one-dimensional sheaves on a del Pezzo surface $S$, supported on curves of class $\beta$ with Euler characteristic one. We show that the divisibility property of the Poincar\'e polynomial of $M_{\beta}$, proposed by Choi-van Garrel-Katz-Takahashi follows from Bousseau's conjectural refined sheaves/Gromov-Witten correspondence. Since this correspondence is known for $S=\mathbb{P}^2$, our result proves Choi-van Garrel-Katz-Takahashi's conjecture in this case.
  For $S=\mathbb{P}^2$, our proof also introduces a novel approach to computing the Poincar\'e polynomials using Gromov-Witten invariants of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ and a local elliptic curve. Specifically, we compute the Poincar\'e polynomials of $M_{d}$ with degrees $d\leq 16$ and derive a closed formula for the leading Betti numbers $b_i(M_d)$ with $d\geq 6$ and $i\leq 4d-22$. We also propose a conjectural formula for the leading Betti numbers $b_i(M_d)$ with $d\geq 4$ and $i\leq 6d-20$. In the Appendix (by M. Moreira), a more general conjecture concerning the higher range Betti numbers of $M_{d}$ is presented, along with another conjecture that involves refinements from the perverse/Chern filtration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit construction is presented of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus in terms of a flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra. The integration kernels consist of modular tensors, built from convolutions of the Arakelov Green function and its derivatives with holomorphic Abelian differentials, combined into a flat connection. Our construction thereby produces explicit formulas for polylogarithms as higher-genus modular tensors. This construction generalizes the elliptic polylogarithms of Brown-Levin, and prompts future investigations into the relation with the function spaces of higher-genus polylogarithms in the work of Enriquez-Zerbini.</description>

      <title>Higgs branch RG-flows via Decay and Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic quivers have been an instrumental technique for advancing our understanding of Higgs branches of supersymmetric theories with 8 supercharges. In this work, we present the decay and fission algorithm for unitary magnetic quivers. It enables the derivation of the complete phase (Hasse) diagram and is characterised by the following key attributes: First and foremost, the algorithm is inherently simple; just relying on convex linear algebra. Second, any magnetic quiver can only undergo decay or fission processes; these reflect the possible Higgs branch RG-flows (Higgsings), and the quivers thereby generated are the magnetic quivers of the new RG fixed points. Third, the geometry of the decay or fission transition (i.e. the transverse slice) is simply read off. As a consequence, the algorithm does not rely on a complete list of minimal transitions, but rather outputs the transverse slice geometry automatically. As a proof of concept, its efficacy is showcased across various scenarios, encompassing SCFTs from dimensions 3 to 6, instanton moduli spaces, and little string theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we argue that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/non-perturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we build connections between K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers, i.e., complete (possibly non-compact) shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons, and algebraic geometry. In particular, we (1). prove that a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker is naturally a quasi-projective variety, using birational algebraic geometry; (2). formulate a conjecture relating the existence of K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and K-stability of polarized Fano fibrations, which unifies and extends the YTD type conjectures for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone metrics and compact K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers; (3). formulate conjectures connecting tangent flows at singularities of K\"ahler-Ricci flows and algebraic geometry, via a 2-step degeneration for the weighted volume of a Fano fibration.</description>

      <title>An algebraicity conjecture of Drinfeld and the moduli of $p$-divisible groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed stacky prismatic technology of Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie to give a uniform, group-theoretic construction of smooth stacks $\mathrm{BT}^{G,\mu}_{n}$ attached to a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $1$-bounded cocharacter $\mu$, verifying a recent conjecture of Drinfeld. This can be viewed as a refinement of results of B\"ultel-Pappas, who gave a related construction using $(G,\mu)$-displays defined via rings of Witt vectors. We show that, when $G = \mathrm{GL}_h$ and $\mu$ is a minuscule cocharacter, these stacks are isomorphic to the stack of truncated $p$-divisible groups of height $h$ and dimension $d$ (the latter depending on $\mu$). This gives a generalization of results of Ansch\"utz-Le Bras, yielding a linear algebraic classification of $p$-divisible groups over very general $p$-adic bases, and verifying another conjecture of Drinfeld.
  The proofs use deformation techniques from derived algebraic geometry, combined with an animated variant of Lau's theory of higher frames and displays, and -- with a view towards applications to the study of local and global Shimura varieties -- actually prove representability results for a wide range of stacks whose tangent complexes are $1$-bounded in a suitable sense. As an immediate application, we prove algebraicity for the stack of perfect $F$-gauges of Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and level $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ without complex multiplication, we provide an explicit sharp bound on the index of the image of the adelic representation $\rho_E$. In particular, if $\operatorname{h}_{\mathcal{F}}(E)$ is the stable Faltings height of $E$, we show that $[\operatorname{GL}_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}) : \operatorname{Im}\rho_E]$ is bounded above by $10^{21} (\operatorname{h}_{\mathcal{F}}(E)+40)^{4.42}$, and, for $\operatorname{h}_{\mathcal{F}}(E)$ tending to infinity, by $\operatorname{h}_{\mathcal{F}}(E)^{3+o(1)}$. We also classify the possible (conjecturally non-existent) images of the representations $\rho_{E,p^n}$ whenever $\operatorname{Im}\rho_{E,p}$ is contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan. This result improves previous work of Zywina and Lombardo.</description>

Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$ is called complete if it is not contained in a larger $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$. In this paper, we classify $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear complete symmetric rank-distance (CSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ up to equivalence. This includes the classification of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear maximum symmetric rank-distance (MSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Our approach is mainly geometric, and our results contribute towards the classification of nets of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q)$.</description>
