      <title>Non-Equilibrium Oscillations Arising in Thermally Induced Convective Systems through Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering (HDLS) with a dual-laser beam setup to investigate the drift velocities of colloidal particles immersed in a solvent exposed to thermally-induced convection. Our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the intensity autocorrelation function, which are linked to the particle drift velocities. In addition to this non-equilibrium oscillations, we report an enhanced decay of the intensity correlation function attributable to the loss of correlation as particles depart from the scattering volume due to prevailing convective flow. A pivotal discovery of our research is the identification of a specific temperature gradient threshold, beyond which pronounced velocity fluctuations ensue as a consequence of the establishment of a non-stationary flow within the measurement cell. The experimental results, obtained for different colloidal systems, are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics simulations and Brownian dynamics simulations, yielding excellent agreement with the experimental data, and providing a robust and complete explanation of the observed phenomena. This study presents an insight in the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, offering a reliable method to study complex behaviors in convective systems through advanced HDLS techniques and multidisciplinary simulations.</description>

      <title>GMXPolymer: a generated polymerization algorithm based on GROMACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for generating generalized structures of amorphous polymers using simulated polymerization and molecular dynamics equilibration, with a particular focus on amorphous polymers. The techniques and algorithms used in this method are described in the main text, and example input scripts are provided for the GMXPolymer code, which is based on the GROMACS molecular dynamics package. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we apply it to different glassy polymers exhibiting varying degrees of functionality, polarity, and rigidity. The reliability of the method is validated by comparing simulation results to experimental data for various structural and thermal properties, all of which show excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>A Framework for a High Throughput Screening Method to Assess Polymer/Plasticizer Miscibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer composite materials require softening to reduce their glass transition temperature and improve processability. To this end, plasticizers, which are small organic molecules, are added to the polymer matrix. The miscibility of these plasticizers has a large impact on their effectiveness and therefore their interactions with the polymer matrix must be carefully considered. Many plasticizer characteristics, including their size, topology and flexibility, can impact their miscibility and, because of the exponentially large numbers of plasticizers, the current trial-and-error approach is very ineffective. In this work we show that using molecular simulations of a small dataset of 48 plasticizers, it is possible to identify topological and thermodynamic descriptors that are proxy for their miscibility. Using ad-hoc molecular dynamics simulation set-ups that are relatively computationally inexpensive, we establish correlations between the plasticizers' topology, internal flexibility, thermodynamics of aggregation and their degree of miscibility and use these descriptors to classify the molecules as miscible or immiscible. With all available data we also construct a decision tree model which achieves a F1 score of 0.86 +/- 0.01 with repeated, stratified 5-fold cross-validation, indicating that this machine learning method is a promising route to fully automate the screening. By evaluating the individual performance of the descriptors, we show this procedure enables a 10-fold reduction of the test space and provides the basis for the development of workflows which can efficiently screen thousands of plasticizers with a variety of features.</description>

      <title>Anti-Coulomb interaction between charges in a dielectric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the ``anti-Coulomb'' interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory of Polarizable Polymer Chains with Nonlocal Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromechanical response of polymeric soft matter to applied electric fields is of fundamental scientific interest as well as relevant to technologies for sensing and actuation. Several existing theoretical and numerical approaches for polarizable polymers subject to a combined applied electric field and stretch are based on discrete monomer models. In these models, accounting for the interactions between the induced dipoles on monomers is challenging due to the nonlocality of these interactions. On the other hand, the framework of statistical field theory provides a continuous description of polymer chains that potentially enables a tractable way to account for these interactions. However, prior formulations using this framework have been restricted to the case of weak anisotropy of the monomer polarizability.
  This paper formulates a general approach based in the framework of statistical field theory to account for the nonlocal nature of the dipolar interactions without any restrictions on the anisotropy or nonlinearity of the polarizability of the monomer. The approach is based on 3 key elements: (1) the statistical field theory framework, in which the discrete monomers are regularized to a continuous dipole distribution; (2) a replacement of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions by the local electrostatics PDE with the continuous dipole distribution as the forcing; (3) the use of a completely general relation between the polarization and the local electric field. Rather than treat the dipole-dipole interactions directly, the continuous description in the field theory enables the computationally-tractable nonlocal-to-local transformation. Further, it enables the use of a realistic statistical-mechanical ensemble wherein the average far-field applied electric field is prescribed, rather than prescribing the applied field at every point in the polymer domain.</description>

      <title>Structural build-up at rest in the induction and acceleration periods of OPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural build-up in fresh cement paste at rest is characterized by time evolutions of storage modulus and yield stress, which both increase linearly in time during the induction period of hydration, followed by an exponential evolution after entering the acceleration period. While it is understood that C-S-H formation at contact points between cement particles dictates build-up in the acceleration period, the mechanism in the induction period lacks consensus. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, at least in absence of admixtures, structural build-up at rest originates in both periods from the same mechanism. We couple calorimetry and oscillatory shear measurements of OPC at different w/c ratios, capturing how the storage modulus evolves with changes in cumulative heat. We obtain an exponential relation between stiffness and heat, with the same exponent in both the induction and acceleration periods. This suggests that C-S-H formation dictates build-up at rest in both periods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. Alternatively, we relate this to the existence of an emergent force of entropic origin that dictates the transport near interfaces.</description>

      <title>Surface Tension of Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions. A Thermomechanical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the surface tension of aqueous electrolyte solutions in contact with non-polar dielectric media using a thermomechanical approach, which involves deriving the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of an inhomogeneous fluid. To obtain the surface tension, we calculate both the normal and tangential pressures using the components of the stress tensor, recently derived by us [Y. A. Budkov and P. E. Brandyshev, The Journal of Chemical Physics 159 (2023)] within the framework of Wang's variational field theory. Using this approach, we derive an analytical expression for the surface tension in the linear approximation. At low ionic concentrations, this expression represents the classical Onsager-Samaras limiting law. By utilizing only one fitting parameter, which is related to the affinity of anions to the dielectric boundary, we can approximate various experimental data regarding the surface tension of aqueous electrolyte solutions. This approximation applies to both the solution-air and solution-dodecane interfaces, covering a wide range of electrolyte concentrations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the shear modulus of dense microgel suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer microgels exhibit intriguing macroscopic flow properties arising from their unique microscopic structure. Microgel colloids comprise a crosslinked polymer network with a radially decaying density profile, resulting in a dense core surrounded by a fuzzy corona. Notably, microgels synthesized from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) are thermoresponsive, capable of adjusting their size and density profile based on temperature. Above the lower critical solution temperature ($T_\text{LCST}\sim 33$ $^\circ$C), the microgel's polymer network collapses, leading to the expulsion of water through a reversible process. Conversely, below $33$ $^\circ$C, the microgel's network swells, becoming highly compressible and allowing overpacking to effective volume fractions exceeding one. Under conditions of dense packing, microgels undergo deformation in distinct stages: corona compression and faceting, interpenetration, and finally, isotropic compression. Each stage exhibits a characteristic signature in the yield stress and elastic modulus of the dense microgel suspensions. Here, we introduce a model for the linear elastic shear modulus through the minimization of a quasi-equilibrium free energy, encompassing all relevant energetic contributions. We validate our model by comparing its predictions to experimental results from oscillatory shear rheology tests on microgel suspensions at different densities and temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that combining macroscopic rheological measurements with the model allows for temperature-dependent characterization of polymer interaction parameters.</description>

Abstract: We present experiments, supported by mechanically detailed simulations, establishing bulk vapor-liquid condensation of a hard-bead fluid by a tiny population of orientable motile grains that self-assembles into a moving polarized monolayer. In a quasi-1D geometry two such layers, oppositely aligned, immobilize the condensed non-motile component. We account for our observations through a continuum theory with a naturally non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard structure, whose predicted trends as a function of packing fraction are consistent with our observations.</description>

      <title>Loss of memory of an elastic line on its way to limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under an oscillating mechanical drive, an amorphous material progressively forgets its initial configuration and might eventually converge to a limit cycle. Beyond quasistatic drivings, how structurally disordered systems lose or record such memory remains theoretically challenging. Here we investigate these issues in a minimal model system -- with quenched disorder and memory encoded in a spatial pattern -- where the oscillating protocol can formally be replaced by finite positive-velocity driving. We consider an elastic line driven at zero temperature in a fixed disordered landscape, with bi-periodic boundary conditions and tunable system size. This setting allows us to control the area swept by the line at each cycle in a given disorder realisation, as would the amplitude of an oscillating drive. We find that the line converges to disorder-dependent limit cycles, jointly for its geometrical \emph{and} velocity profiles. Moreover, the way it forgets its initial condition is strongly coupled to the nature of the velocity dynamics it displays depending on system size. We conclude on the implications of these results for the response of amorphous materials under \emph{non}-quasistatic oscillating protocols.</description>
