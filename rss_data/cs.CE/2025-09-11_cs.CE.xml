      <title>Hybrid Physics-Data Enrichments to Represent Uncertainty in Reduced Gas-Surface Chemistry Models for Hypersonic Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During hypersonic flight, air reacts with a planetary re-entry vehicle's thermal protection system (TPS), creating reaction products that deplete the TPS. Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</description>

      <title>Solving contact problems using Fiber Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of contact is fundamental to many engineering applications, yet accurately and efficiently solving complex contact problems remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new contact algorithm that computes contact forces by taking the gradient of an energy function of the contact volume (overlap) with respect to the geometry descriptors. While elegant in concept, evaluating this gradient is non-trivial due to the arbitrary geometry of the contact region. Inspired by the recently proposed Fiber Monte Carlo (FMC) method, we develop an algorithm that accurately computes contact forces based on the overlap volume between bodies with complex geometries. Our computational framework operates independently of mesh conformity, eliminating the need for master-slave identification and projection iterations, thus handling arbitrary discretizations. Moreover, by removing explicit complementarity constraints, the method retains a simple structure that can be easily incorporated into existing numerical solvers, such as the finite element method. In this paper, numerical examples cover a wide range of contact scenarios, from classical small-deformation static contact to complex large-deformation dynamic contact in both two- and three-dimensional settings with nonlinear material behavior. These cases include Hertzian contact for small-deformation verification; contact between wedge- and cone-shaped bodies to assess pressure and displacement predictions at non-smooth boundaries; contact involving Neo-Hookean hyperelastic materials for evaluating nonlinear responses under finite deformation; and dynamic collision cases to examine transient behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).</description>

      <title>LSMTCR: A Scalable Multi-Architecture Model for Epitope-Specific T Cell Receptor de novo Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing full-length, epitope-specific TCR $\alpha\beta$ remains challenging due to vast sequence space, data biases and incomplete modeling of immunogenetic constraints. We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3$\beta$ and transferred to CDR3$\alpha$, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete $\alpha\beta$ sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For $\alpha$-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired $\alpha\beta$ co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with deformable interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference in Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful and accurate method to sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. However, HMC techniques are computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their posterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as variational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to infer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations introduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines inexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify uncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach leverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence of individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a large proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to uncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to significantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed only for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction uncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for posterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator networks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can effectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the operator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in hypersonic flow.</description>

      <title>CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CAME-AB}, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an \emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525</description>
