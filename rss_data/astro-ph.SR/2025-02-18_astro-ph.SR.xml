      <title>Pulsational characteristics of mass accreting stars in close binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries with pulsating components are a distinct subclass of binaries, merging orbital and pulsational analyses. In recent years, that subclass led to the definition of a newly formed branch of tidal asteroseismology. While single-star pulsators are well understood, the effects of binarity and possible mass transfer on pulsational characteristics, particularly in mass-gaining stars, remain to be systematically explored. Here, I present preliminary results on the asteroseismic properties of a mass-accreting model for a 10 $M_{\odot}$ $\beta$ Cephei-type star</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf: interaction signatures in the spectrum at 445 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the most neaby and brightest Type II supernovae (SNe) of the past decades. A rich set of pre-explosion data provided important insight on the properties of the progenitor star. There has been a wide range of estimated initial masses of 9 - 22 $M{_\odot}$. Early monitoring of the SN also showed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that was probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion. These extended CSM structure can be further probed with late-time observations during the nebular phase. This study is based on a nebular spectrum obtained with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope 445 days after explosion. The SN evolution is analyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and compared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer nebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear signs of ejecta-CSM interaction. The H${\alpha}$ profile shows a complex profile that can be separated into a boxy component arising from the interaction with a CSM shell and a central peaked component that may be due to the radioactive-powered SN ejecta. The CSM shell would be located at a distance of $\approx10^{16}$ cm from the progenitor and it may be associated with mass loss occurring up until $\approx 500 - 1000$ years before the explosion. Similar interaction signatures have been detected in other SNe II, although for events with standard plateau durations this happened at times later than 600 - 700 days. SN 2023ixf appears to belong to a group of SNe II with short plateaus or linear light curves that develop interaction features before $\approx 500$ days. Other lines, such as those from [O I] and [Ca II] appear to be unaffected by the CSM interaction. This allowed us to estimate an initial progenitor mass, which resulted in the relatively low range of 10 - 15 $M{_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Solar System Elemental Abundances from the Solar Photosphere and CI-Chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar photospheric abundances and CI-chondrite compositions are reviewed and updated to obtain representative solar system abundances of the elements and their isotopes. The new photospheric abundances obtained here lead to higher solar metallicity. Full 3D NLTE photospheric analyses are only available for 11 elements. A quality index for analyses is introduced. For several elements, uncertainties remain large. Protosolar mass fractions are H (X = 0.7060), He (Y = 0.2753), and for metals Li to U (Z = 0.0187). The protosolar (C+N)/H agrees within 13% with the ratio for the solar core from the Borexino experiment. Elemental abundances in CI-chondrites were screened by analytical methods, sample sizes, and evaluated using concentration frequency distributions. Aqueously mobile elements (e.g., alkalis, alkaline earths, etc.) often deviate from normal distributions indicating mobilization and/or sequestration into carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates. Revised CI-chondrite abundances of non-volatile elements are similar to earlier estimates. The moderately volatile elements F and Sb are higher than before, as are C, Br and I, whereas the CI-abundances of Hg and N are now significantly lower. The solar system nuclide distribution curves of s-process elements agree within 4% with s-process predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. P-process nuclide distributions are assessed. No obvious correlation of CI-chondritic to solar elemental abundance ratios with condensation temperatures is observed, nor is there one for ratios of CI-chondrites/solar wind abundances.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Predictions for the Next Outburst of T Coronae Borealis: It will be the Brightest Classical or Recurrent Nova Ever Observed in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (TCrB) is a recurrent nova (RN) with recorded outbursts in 1866, and 1946 and possible outbursts in 1217 and 1787. It is predicted to explode again in 2025 or 2026 based on multiple observational studies. The system consists of a massive (M$_{wd}$ $\gtrsim$ 1.35 M$_\odot$) white dwarf (WD) and a red giant (M3-M4 III). We have performed 1-D hydrodynamic simulations with NOVA to predict the behavior of the next outburst. These simulations consist of a range of mass accretion rates onto $\sim$1.35 M$_\odot$ WDs, designed to bound the conditions necessary to achieve ignition of an explosion after an $\approx$80 year inter-outburst period. We have used both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon initial compositions, in order to include the possible ejecta abundances to be measured in the observations of the next outburst. As the WD in the TCrB system is observed to be massive, theoretical predictions reported here imply that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the TNR. Therefore, the secular evolution of the WD may allow it to approach the Chandrasekhar limit and either explode as a Type Ia supernova or undergo accretion induced collapse, depending on its underlying composition. We have followed the evolution of just the WD, after removing the ejected matter from the surface layers. Our intent is to illuminate the mystery of the unique, second, maximum in the two well observed outbursts and we have found conditions that bracket the predictions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Explodability of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.</description>

      <title>Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. I. Nature of Solar Cycle Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-cycle variations in the series of 11-year solar activity cycles have a significant impact on both the space environment and climate. Whether solar cycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic perturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two mechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar dynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative map, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and stochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent in the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of the poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle strength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map exhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal cycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle variability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly influence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for predicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength when an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle loses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles. Although the simplicity of the iterative map, the behaviors it exhibits are generic for the nonlinear system. Our results provide guidelines for analyzing solar dynamo models in terms of chaos and stochasticity, highlight the limitation in predicting solar cycle, and motivate further refinement of observational constraints on nonlinear and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. II. The Gnevyshev-Ohl Rule and its Generation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule, also known as the even-odd effect, is an important observational phenomenon in solar cycles, suggesting that cycles with even indices tend to be followed by stronger cycles. The rule is considered to be related to the solar dynamo, which drives the evolution of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field. However, observational studies of the G-O rule have revealed inconsistencies, particularly regarding long-term variations and the underlying physical mechanisms. In this study, we use an iterative map derived within the framework of the Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo to analyze the G-O rule. We investigate comprehensive and definitive forms of the G-O rule using both a sufficiently large number of solar cycles and a limited number of solar cycles. Our findings indicate a higher probability for an arbitrary cycle to be followed by a stronger cycle instead of weaker, regardless of even or odd. Over time spans comparable to historical observations, cycles exhibit periods that follow both the G-O rule and the reversed G-O rule, without a statistically significant preference, consistent with the observed variability of the G-O rule. The occurrence of the reversed G-O rule is random, rather than periodic. The G-O rule emerges as a result of the nonlinearity and stochasticity inherent in the BL mechanism. These results advance our understanding of the solar cycle and pave the way for improved solar dynamo modeling.</description>

      <title>The impact of wind accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to binary systems has long struggled to produce reliable mass accretion efficiencies when the stellar wind velocity of the donor star is smaller than the orbital velocity of the accretor. This limitation is significant in symbiotic systems where such conditions exist. Recently, our group introduced a geometric correction to the standard implementation of the BHL model that demonstrates improved agreement with numerical simulations. The present work investigates the impact of this new implementation on the evolution of symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. Our results show that the choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.</description>

      <title>A population synthesis study of the Gaia 100 pc unresolved white dwarf-main sequence binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main sequence star (WDMS) are valuable for studying key astrophysical questions. However, observational biases strongly affect the known population, particularly unresolved systems where the main sequence star outshines the white dwarf. This work aims to comprehensively simulate the population of unresolved WDMS binaries within 100 pc of the Sun and to compare the outcome with the currently most complete volume-limited sample available from Gaia data. We employ a population synthesis code, MRBIN, extensively developed by our group and based on Monte Carlo techniques, which uses a standard binary stellar evolutionary code adapted to cover a wide range of stars across all ages, masses, and metallicities. Selection criteria matching those of Gaia observations are applied to generate synthetic populations comparable to the observed WDMS sample. The synthetic data accurately populate the expected regions in the Gaia color-magnitude diagram. However, simulations predict a lower number of extremely low-mass white dwarfs, suggesting potential issues in observed mass derivations. Additionally, our analysis constrains the common envelope efficiency to 0.1-0.4, consistent with previous findings, and estimates a total completeness of about 25% for the observed sample, confirming the strong observational limitations for unresolved WDMS.</description>

      <title>High-spatial-resolution simulations of Be star disks in binary systems: I. Structure and kinematics of coplanar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binarity in massive stars has proven to be an important aspect in the their evolution. For Be stars, it might be the cause of their spin up, and thus part of the mechanism behind the formation of their viscous decretion disks. Detecting companions in systems with Be stars is challenging, making it difficult to obtain observational constraints on their binary fraction. We explore the effects of a binary companion in a system with a Be star, from disk formation to quasi steady-state using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of coplanar, circular binary systems. High spatial resolution is achieved by adopting particle splitting in the SPH code, as well as a more realistic description of the secondary star and the disk viscosity. The tidal forces considerably affect the Be disk, forming distinct regions in the system, with observational consequences that can be used to infer the presence of a otherwise undetectable companion. With the upgraded code, we can probe a region approximately 4 times larger than previously possible. We describe the configuration and kinematics of each part of the system, and provide a summary of their expected observational signals. Material that enters the Roche lobe of the companion is partially captured by it, forming a rotationally supported, disk-like structure. Material not accreted escapes and forms a circumbinary disk around the system. This is the first work to describe the region beyond the truncation region of the Be disk and its observational consequences with detail. We argue that observational features of previously unclear origin, such as the intermittent shell features and emission features of HR 2142 and HD 55606, originate in areas beyond the truncation region. This new understanding of the behavior of disks in Be binaries will allow not just for better interpretation of existing data, but also for the planning of future observations.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Measurements and Analysis of Double Star System BRT 376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using new telescope images and archival data, we investigated the positions and motions of the stars in double star system 06160-0745 BRT 376. We found that the two stars share nearly identical parallaxes and exhibit a low relative proper motion, suggesting they move together through space. Furthermore, their combined 3D velocity is less than the calculated escape velocity, indicating they are gravitationally bound rather than just physically near each other. These findings point to 06160-0745 BRT 376 being a true binary system. Future observations will help refine our understanding of its orbital path and further illuminate the nature of stars in close, interacting pairs.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Gaia view of ellipsoidal and rotational red giant binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) provided variability information for $\sim$1000 long-period red giant binaries, the largest sample to date of this binary type having both photometric and spectroscopic time series observations. We cross-matched the Gaia DR3 measurements with the catalogue of long-period red giant candidates from the Gaia FPR, having photometric and radial velocity variability information. Combined with the photo-geometric distances, the extinction, bolometric magnitude, luminosity, spectroscopic radius and mass were estimated. ELL variables are characterized to be low to intermediate-mass stars, with radii as large as the Roche lobe radius of the binary. Eccentricities tend to be lower for primary stars with smaller radii, as the expected result of tidal circularization. Combined with the orbital properties, estimates for the minimum mass of the companion agree with the scenario of a low-mass compact object as the secondary star. There are at least 14 ELL binaries with orbital periods and masses compatible with model predictions for Type Ia SN progenitors. For the rotational variables, their orbital periods, enhanced chromospheric activity, smaller radii and low mass point to a different type of binaries than the original ELL sample. The velocity dispersion is much higher in ELL than in rotational binaries, probably indicating older/younger dynamical ages. The enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances for some of the ELL binaries resemble the population of young $\alpha$-rich binaries in the thick disk. An episode of mass transfer in those systems may have produced the enhanced $\alpha$ abundances, and the enhanced [Ce/Fe] abundances reported in a few ELL binaries. Luminosities, radii and masses were derived for 243 ELL and 39 rotational binary candidates, the largest Galactic sample of these variables, having chemo-dynamical and physical parameterization.</description>

      <title>Mutual Validation of Datasets for Analyzing Tilt Angles in Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tilt angle of solar active regions (AR) is crucial for the Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models in the buildup of polar field. However, divergent results regarding properties of tilt angles were reported due to their wide scatter, caused by intrinsic solar mechanisms and measurement errors. Here, we mutually validate the magnetogram-based AR tilt angle dataset from Wang, Jiang, &amp; Luo with the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data by identifying common data points where both datasets provide comparable tilt angles for the same AR/sunspot. The mutually validated datasets effectively reduce measurement errors, enabling a more accurate analysis of the intrinsic properties of tilt angles. Our mutually validated datasets reveal that the difference between white-light-based and magnetogram-based tilt angles has no significant difference. Also, the datasets show that an upward revision of average tilt angle ($\bar\alpha$) and a downward revision of the tilt scatter ($\sigma_\alpha$) compared to previous results are necessary, with typical values of about 7$^\circ$ and 16$^\circ$, respectively. The $\sigma_\alpha$ values demonstrate a strong correlation with AR flux and sunspot area, with the dependency functions re-evaluated using mutually validated datasets. Furthermore, both $\bar\alpha$ and the tilt coefficient for the weak cycle 24 are larger than those for cycle 23. This supports the tilt quenching mechanism, which posits an anti-correlation between the cycle-averaged tilt angle and cycle amplitude. Additionally, tilt angle from the mutually validated dataset has a weak non-monotonic relationship with magnetic flux and does not depend on the maximum magnetic field strength of ARs.</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation in the solar corona and solar wind: A comparative analysis of radio-occultation observations and magnetohydrodynamic simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent in-situ observations and numerical models indicated various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves contributing to the solar wind acceleration. Among them is an MHD wave decomposition at distances closer than 50 $R_{\odot}$ using data taken by the first perihelion pass of Parker Solar Probe (PSP). However, the underlying physical processes responsible for the formation of the solar wind have not yet been observationally confirmed at distances closer than 10 $R_{\odot}$. We aim to infer the mode population of density fluctuations observed by radio occultation, which has all been attributed to slow magnetoacoustic waves. We compare the radio occultation observations conducted in 2016 using the JAXA's Venus orbiter Akatsuki with the MHD simulation. The time-frequency analysis was applied to the density fluctuations observed by the radio occultation and those reproduced in the MHD model. The time-spatial spectrum of the density fluctuation in the model exhibits two components that are considered to be fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves. The fast magnetoacoustic waves in the model tend to have periods shorter than the slow magnetoacoustic waves, and the superposition of these modes has a broadened spectrum extending in the range of approximately 20$-$1000 s, which resembles that of the observed waves. Based on this comparison, it is probable that the density oscillations observed by radio occultation include fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, and that fast magnetoacoustic waves are predominant at short periods and slow magnetoacoustic waves are prevalent at long periods. This is qualitatively similar to the results of the mode decomposition obtained from the PSP's first perihelion at more distance regions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an accretion bridge in the DX Cha circumbinary system from VLTI/MATISSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DX Cha (HD 104237) is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a Herbig A7.5Ve-A8Ve primary star and a K3-type companion. Here we report on new $3.55$ micrometer interferometric observations of this source with the Multi Aperture Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). To model the four MATISSE observations obtained between 2020 and 2023, we constructed a time-dependent interferometric model of the system, using the oimodeler software. The model consists of an asymmetric ring and two point sources on a Keplerian orbit. Our best-fit model consists of a circumbinary ring with a diameter of $0.86$ au ($8.1$ mas), featuring a strong azimuthal asymmetry. We found that the position angle of the asymmetry changes tens of degrees between the MATISSE epochs. The ring is relatively narrow, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$$0.13$ au ($1.23$ mas). The presence of circumstellar dust emission so close to the binary is unexpected, as previous hydrodynamic simulations predicted an inner disk cavity with a diameter of $\sim$$4$ au ($\sim$$37.5$ mas). Thus, we argue that the narrow envelope of material we detected is probably not a gravitationally stable circumbinary ring, but may be part of tidal accretion streamers channeling material from the inner edge of the disk toward the stars.</description>

      <title>EBOP MAVEN: A machine learning model for predicting eclipsing binary light curve fitting parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. While there is a vast source of candidate systems in the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS, published catalogues of well-characterised systems fall short of reflecting this abundance. We seek to improve the efficiency of efforts to process these data with the development of a machine learning model to inspect dEB light curves and predict the input parameters for subsequent formal analysis by the jktebop code.</description>

      <title>Mass loss along the red giant branch of the intermediate stellar populations in NGC6752 and NGC2808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of the Horizontal Branch (HB) in Globular Clusters (GC) is among the early evidences that they contain multiple populations of stars. Indeed, the location of each star along the HB depends both on its initial helium content (Y) and on the global average mass loss along the red giant branch ($\mu$). In most GCs, it is generally straightforward to analyse the first stellar population (standard Y), and the most extreme one (largest Y), while it is more tricky to look at the "intermediate" populations (mildly enhanced Y). In this work, we do this for the GCs NGC6752 and NGC2808; wherever possible the helium abundance for each stellar populations is constrained by using independent measurements present in the literature. We compare population synthesis models with photometric catalogues from the Hubble Space Telescope Treasury survey to derive the parameters of these HB stars. We find that the location of helium enriched stars on the HB is reproduced only by adopting a higher value of $\mu$ with respect to the first generation stars in all the analysed stellar populations. We also find that $\mu$ correlates with the helium enhancement of the populations. This holds for both clusters. This finding is naturally predicted by the model of ''pre-main sequence disc early loss'', previously suggested in the literature, and is consistent with the findings of multiple-populations formation models that foresee the formation of second generation stars in a cooling flow.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields or Overstable Convective Modes in HR 7495: Exploring the Underlying Causes of the Spike in the 'Hump &amp; Spike' Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 200 A- and F-type stars observed with Kepler exhibit a distinctive 'hump &amp; spike' feature in their Fourier spectra. The hump is commonly interpreted as unresolved Rossby modes, while the spike has been linked to rotational modulation. Two competing interpretations exist for the spike: magnetic phenomena, such as stellar spots, or Overstable Convective (OsC) modes resonantly exciting low-frequency g modes within the stellar envelope.
  We analysed photometric data from Kepler and TESS for HR 7495, the brightest 'hump &amp; spike' star (V=5.06), covering 4.5 years and four seasons, respectively. Additionally, radial velocity measurements and spectropolarimetric data were used to investigate magnetic fields and surface features. Furthermore, we analysed model-based artificial light and radial velocity curves to examine the influence of OsC modes on the phase-folded light curves.
  The phase-folded light curves show that the spike characteristics of HR 7495 align more closely with rotational modulation by stellar spots than with OsC modes. No significant magnetic fields were detected, limiting the field's possible amplitude and geometry. This supports the hypothesis of a subsurface convective layer operating a dynamo, producing low-amplitude, complex magnetic fields. The variability patterns suggest multiple evolving spots. A comparison of contemporaneously observed light and RV data with modelled OsC modes reveals a 0.5 phase offset, strongly disfavouring pulsations as the cause of the spike.
  While the evolutionary stage of HR 7495 does not entirely preclude the possibility of OsC modes, the observational data overwhelmingly support the stellar spots hypothesis. Our analysis, combined with previous literature, suggests that if not all A- and F-type, at least the 'hump &amp; spike' stars, harbour an undetected weak magnetic field, likely driven by a dynamo mechanism.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Pulsations in AGB Stars: Insights from 3D RHD CO5BOLD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.</description>

      <title>FIP Bias Evolution in an Emerging Active Region as observed in SPICE Synoptic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FIP (First Ionization Potential) bias is one of the most relevant diagnostics for solar plasma composition. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FIP bias is a time-dependant quantity. In this study, we attempt to answer the following question: how does the FIP bias evolves over time, and what are its drivers and parameters? We investigate active region (AR) observations recorded by the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) spectrometer SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment) instrument on-board Solar Orbiter. These observations include a set of EUV lines from ions emitting at temperatures ranging from $\log \text{T}=4.2$ to $\log \text{T}=6.0$. We focus on the period of December 20th to 22nd 2022 and look at the evolution of different physical quantities (e.g. intensity, temperature and fractionation of elements) within the passing AR present in the field of view (FOV). We investigate the time dependence of the FIP bias, particularly on the behavior of intermediate-FIP elements, sulfur and carbon, in regions of interest. We focus on the Mg / Ne ratio, which is a proxy for higher temperatures and higher heights in the atmosphere, and has been widely investigated in previous studies, and two lower temperature / upper chromosphere ratios (S/N, S/O and C/O). We investigate the FIP bias evolution with time but also with temperature and height in the solar atmosphere, and compare the observations with the ponderomotive force model. We find good correlation between the model and results, encouraging an Alfv\'en-wave driven fractionation of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Spindown of massive main sequence stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We need to understand the spin evolution of massive stars to compute their internal rotationally induced mixing processes, isolate effects of close binary evolution, and predict the rotation rates of white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes.
  Aims. We discuss the spindown of massive main sequence stars imposed by stellar winds.
  Methods. We use detailed grids of single star evolutionary models to predict the distribution of the surface rotational velocities of core-hydrogen burning Galactic massive stars as function of their mass and evolutionary state. We then compare the spin properties of our synthetic populations with appropriately selected sub-samples of Galactic main sequence OB-type stars extracted from the IACOB survey.
  Results. We find that below $\sim 40 M_\odot$, observations and models agree in finding that the surface rotational velocities of Galactic massive stars remain relatively constant during their main sequence evolution. The more massive stars in the IACOB sample appear to spin down less than predicted, while our updated angular momentum loss prescription predicts an enhanced spindown. Furthermore, the observations show a population of fast rotators, with $v \sin I \gtrsim 200$ km/s persisting for all ages, which is not reproduced by our synthetic single star populations.
  Conclusions. We conclude that the wind-induced spindown of massive main sequence stars is yet to be fully understood, and that close binary evolution might significantly contribute to the fraction of rapid rotators in massive stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure and Molecular Formation in Polaris Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a wide-field $(60\arcmin \times 30\arcmin)$ study of a dense region within the Polaris Flare, hereafter referred to as the `Polaris molecular cloud', using $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J=1-0$) observations at $20\arcsec$ resolution, obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope. The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column densities up to $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, evidenced by an anti-correlation between $\textsc{Hi}$ and CO distributions, indicating active atomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for molecular formation at $\sim5\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is common among more evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $X_{\rm CO}$, was found to be $0.7 \times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, lower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the cloud's age to be $\sim10^{5}-10^{6}$ years, suggesting an early stage of molecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed low $X_{\rm CO}$ factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud is gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures extending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity gradients of $0.5-1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, and analysis of the velocities shows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body, following a free-fall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes through the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be important even at column densities of $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Image Pre-Processing Framework for Time-Domain Astronomy in the Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image analysis methods in time-domain astronomy, particularly those leveraging AI algorithms, has highlighted efficient image pre-processing as a critical bottleneck affecting algorithm performance. Image pre-processing, which involves standardizing images for training or deployment of various AI algorithms, encompasses essential steps such as image quality evaluation, alignment, stacking, background extraction, gray-scale transformation, cropping, source detection, astrometry, and photometry. Historically, these algorithms were developed independently by different research groups, primarily based on CPU architecture for small-scale data processing. This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing that integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture, enabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare for the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two operational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager mode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and flexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm development. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data processing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial intelligence models. We have tested the performance of our framework using simulated and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances image pre-processing speed while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to CPU based algorithms. To promote accessibility and ease of use, a Docker version of our framework is available for download in the PaperData Repository powered by China-VO, compatible with various AI algorithms developed for time-domain astronomy research.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Integral Field Unit at the end of the Athena reformulation phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.</description>

      <title>Network of velocity-coherent filaments formed by supersonic turbulence in a very-high-velocity HI cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The warm neutral medium (WNM) was thought to be subsonically/transonically turbulent, and it lacks a network of intertwined filaments that are commonly seen in both molecular clouds and cold neutral medium (CNM). Here, we report HI~21 cm line observations of a very-high-velocity (-330 km s$^{-1}$ $&lt;V_{\rm LSR}&lt;$ -250 km s$^{-1}$) cloud (VHVC), using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. For the first time, such a VHVC is clearly revealed to be a supersonic WNM system consisting of a network of velocity-coherent HI~filaments. The filaments are in the forms of slim curves, hubs, and webs, distributed in different layers within the position-position-velocity ({\it ppv}) data cube. The entire cloud has skewed log-normal probability distribution of column density and the filaments themselves show asymmetrical radial density profiles, indicating shock compression by supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, as is also confirmed by our MHD simulation (sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}=3$ and Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=1$). This work suggests that hierarchical filaments can be established by shocks in a low-density WNM, where gravity is negligible, offering a viable pathway to structure formation in the earliest evolutionary phases of the interstellar medium (ISM).</description>

      <title>The nature of gravitational wave events with host environment escape velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. It also enables testing general relativity and improves source localization, which the latter is instrumental in multi-messenger astronomy. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events originating from globular clusters. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <title>Searching for Low-Mass Exoplanets Amid Stellar Variability with a Fixed Effects Linear Model of Line-by-Line Shape Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is a powerful technique for exoplanet discovery and characterization. In recent years, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of spectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV signals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic signatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic stellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can provide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true Doppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed effects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line shapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our methodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and cross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to remove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as the sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line shape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately 70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the line-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly less than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multimessenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437$-$4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437$-$4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, concincide with the rough mass range of PSR J0437$-$4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437$-$4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the particle event's properties. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the Sun's front and far sides as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta\phi, the longitudinal separation between source active region and spacecraft magnetic footpoint based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES at 1 au. We also considered occurrences of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry with respect to the best magnetic connection (\Delta\phi=0) in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180&lt;\Delta\phi&lt;-40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40&lt;\Delta\phi&lt;+180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, since for events with \Delta\phi&lt;0 corotation sweeps particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta\phi&gt;0 it takes them away from it. Alternatively it may be related to asymmetric acceleration or propagation effects.</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed in PHOEBE Forward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE, a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding 1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</description>

      <title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18248</link>

Abstract: Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae (SNe). Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova (SN) neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to SNe using neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star (NS) and the distance to the SN, which is analogous to main-sequence fitting. The radius of an NS is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the SN can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of SNe, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to SNe through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of NS radii. This data, via the NS mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Star Proper Motions Based on Two-epoch Observations from the SDSS and DESI Imaging Surveys</title>

Abstract: In this study, we present the construction of a new proper motion catalog utilizing the photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys, with a median time baseline of about 13 years. To mitigate systematic errors, the DESI galaxy positions are employed to establish a reference frame and to correct the position-, magnitude-, and color-dependent discrepancies between SDSS and DESI imaging datasets. Spanning 12,589 square degrees, the catalog encompasses about 223.7 million non-Gaia objects down to $m_r \sim$ 23. Based on 734k quasars, the assessment of the global systematic errors in the DESI-SDSS proper motion catalog yields values of 0.06 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha_{*}}$ and 0.12 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\delta}$. The catalog exhibits precision surpassing 3.4 mas yr$^{-1}$, albeit varying with position, color, and magnitude. An additional evaluation employing approximately 2,644 distant star samples yields an overall precision of approximately 2.5 and 2.9 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha_{*}}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$, respectively. Further comparisons with proper motions from SDSS Stripe 82 reveal a strong consistency between the two datasets. As a practical application, we utilize fainter non-Gaia objects in our catalog to update the proper motions of 15 star clusters. The resulting proper motions for these clusters exhibit excellent consistency with those derived from Gaia data. Our proper motion measurements, characterized by a deeper limiting magnitude, stand as a valuable complement to the Gaia dataset.</description>

      <title>Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>
