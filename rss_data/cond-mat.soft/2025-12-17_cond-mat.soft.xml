      <title>Intelligent matter consisting of active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book chapter, we review how systems of simple motile agents can be used as a pathway to intelligent systems. It is a well known result from nature that large groups of entities following simple rules, such as swarms of animals, can give rise to much more complex collective behavior in a display of emergence. This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of "intelligent matter" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior. This we will then contrast with the approach of physical reservoir computing powered by the dynamics of active particle systems. In this context, we will also describe a novel reservoir computing scheme for active particles driven ultrasonically or via light refraction.</description>

      <title>Structure and Nonlinear Index of Refraction of Sunset Yellow Lyotropic Chromonic Liquid Crystal in the Isotropic and Nematic Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals are formed by the self-assembly of aromatic compounds in concentrated solutions. Despite numerous applications of chromonic systems in optical and photonic devices, they all make use of the anisotropic linear optical properties of the nematic or columnar liquid crystalline phases. This paper extends the investigations of chromonic systems to the domain of nonlinear optics. For this purpose, the magnitude and sign of the nonlinear refractive indices, $n_2,$ were measured by the nonlinear ellipse rotation (NER) technique. This was performed on aqueous solutions of sunset yellow azo dye, the prototypical chromonic system. Samples with different concentrations and temperatures were used, both in the isotropic and nematic phases. In addition, the molecular aggregation states of the chromonic samples as a function of temperature and concentration were investigated by wide angle X-ray scattering. NER measurements as a function of the laser pulse width from $65\,fs$ to $\sim 5\,ps$ allowed the decomposition of $n_2$ into a fast contribution, $n_{2,fast},$ associated with molecular electronic processes, and a slow one $n_{2,slow},$ associated with molecular reorientational processes. It was shown that $n_{2,fast}$ doubled from the isotropic phases of the $15$ to the $30\,\%\,\text{w/w}$ samples, proportionally to the increase in mass fraction. However, $n_{2,fast}$ for the aligned nematic phase of $30\,\%\,\text{w/w}$ sample was higher than the double of the corresponding value for the $15\,\%\,\text{w/w}$ sample, showing an effect associated to the orientational order of this phase. Also, $n_{2,fast}$ was shown to depend linearly on temperature.</description>

      <title>A theory of locally impenetrable elastic tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reduced order theory of locally impenetrable elastic tubes. The constraint of local impenetrability -- an inequality constraint on the determinant of the 3D deformation gradient -- is transferred to the Frenet curvature of the centerline of the tube via reduced kinematics. The constraint is incorporated into a variational scheme, and a complete set of governing equations, jump conditions, and boundary conditions are derived. It is shown that with the local impenetrability actively enforced, configurations of an elastic tube comprise segments of solutions of the Kirchhoff rod theory appropriately connected to segments of constant Frenet curvature. The theory is illustrated by way of three examples: a fully flexible tube hanging under self-weight, an elastic tube hanging under self-weight, and a highly twisted elastic tube.</description>

      <title>Capillary condensation between parallel walls of unequal length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a macroscopic theory of capillary condensation in slits formed by parallel walls of unequal length. Using the concept of an edge contact angle, we identify four distinct condensation states and derive Kelvin-like relations for their onset. The resulting phase diagrams, expressed in terms of wall geometry and contact angle, reveal two central organizing features: a geometric separatrix that divides distinct condensation regimes, and the wedge-filling threshold at $\theta=\pi/4$, which separates a rich four-state scenario from a simpler two-state one. These results demonstrate how geometry dictates the onset and suppression of condensation in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Complete Wetting and Drying at Sinusoidal Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate complete wetting and drying at sinusoidally corrugated solid walls, focusing on the effects of wall geometry and interaction range. Two distinct interaction models are considered: one incorporating only short-ranged (SR) forces (applied to drying), and another including long-ranged (LR) van der Waals interactions (applied to wetting). The SR model is analyzed within the framework of nonlocal Hamiltonian theory by Parry et al., while the LR model is treated using a sharp-kink approximation. In both cases, we derive scaling relations that describe the dependence of the adsorbed layer's width and morphology on the wall's geometric parameters as the system approaches two-phase coexistence. We identify distinct scaling regimes determined by the degree of wall corrugation and highlight the contrasting effects of SR and LR interactions. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical results from classical density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic liquid crystal models for lipid bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained continuous descriptions for lipid bilayers are typically based on minimizing the Helfrich energy. Such models consider the fluid properties of these structures only implicitly and have been shown to nicely reproduce equilibrium properties. Model extensions that also address the dynamics of these structures are surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. They explicitly account for membrane viscosity. However, these models also usually treat the lipid bilayer as a homogeneous continuum, neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom of the lipids. Here, we derive refined models which consider in addition a scalar order parameter representing the molecular alignment of the lipids along the surface normal. Starting from hydrodynamic surface liquid crystal models, we obtain a hydrodynamic surface Landau--Helfrich model for asymmetric lipid bilayers and a surface Beris--Edwards model for symmetric lipid bilayers. The fully ordered case for both models leads to the known surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. Besides more detailed continuous models for lipid bilayers, we therefore also provide an alternative derivation of surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models.</description>

      <title>Interactions between droplets in immiscible liquid suspensions and the influence of surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general method for determining the effective interaction potential between two or more droplets suspended within a fluid phase. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Here, we apply the method to determine the interaction potential between oil droplets suspended in water and also consider the influence of adding a third species, alcohol. This ternary mixture is that found in the ouzo beverage. The ouzo system exhibits spontaneous emulsification when the neat spirit is mixed with water. The oil emulsion that forms has been observed to be surprisingly long-lived. Here we show that the alcohol in the system does indeed play a role in making the droplets more stable, by decreasing the oil-water interfacial tension and therefore also the strength of the attractive interactions between droplets. Within our theory, the surfactant nature of the alcohol can be enhanced without changing the bulk fluid thermodynamics. In fact, our theory can be used to model surfactant mixtures. In this model, the effective interaction between pairs of oil droplets can become repulsive, with a free-energy barrier to droplets merging, thus making them stable.</description>

      <title>How Spatially Modulated Activity Reshapes Active Polymer Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymers are driven out of equilibrium by internal forces and exhibit conformational properties that differ fundamentally from those of passive chains. Here we study how spatially modulated tangential activity reshapes the conformations of semiflexible polymers. Using a continuum Rouse model with bending rigidity, we develop a systematic expansion in the limit of weak activity and derive analytical expressions for mode correlations, gyration radius, and end-to-end distance under sinusoidally varying propulsion. We show that spatially structured activity breaks self-similar scaling and induces a mode-dependent transition between polymer shrinking and swelling. Uniform or low-mode forcing produces compact, globule-like conformations, whereas higher modes generate alternating stretched and compressed segments, leading to globally swollen chains. Different polymer sizes respond differently to activity, allowing for conformations that are compact in gyration radius yet extended in end-to-end distance. Langevin dynamics simulations quantitatively confirm the theoretical predictions. Our results demonstrate that even weak, patterned activity provides a powerful mechanism to control polymer conformations far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis, Laning, and Negative Drag in Binary Systems with Opposite and Perpendicular Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a binary system of particles with repulsive interactions that move in opposite or perpendicular directions to each other under an applied external drive. For opposite driving, at higher drives a phase-separated laned state forms that has strong hysteresis in the velocity-force curve and the fraction of topological defects as the drive is cycled up and down from zero. The amount of hysteresis depends on the drive value at which the drive changes from increasing to decreasing. For perpendicular driving, we find a jammed state that transitions into a disordered state or a tilted lane state, both of which also show strong hysteresis effects. Additionally, a negative drag effect can appear in which one species moves in the direction opposite to the other species due to a tilting of the lanes by the perpendicular drive. When a constant drive is applied along one direction while the drive in the perpendicular direction is increased, we observe a series of drops and jumps in the velocity as the system forms locked and tilted laned states. For weakly interacting particles, the jammed system can show co-tilted stripe-forming states.</description>

      <title>Encounter Times of Intermittently Running Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular processes often rely on the timely encounter of mobile reaction partners, including intermittently motor-driven organelles. The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality. These findings provide a framework for estimating intracellular encounter kinetics, highlighting the role of key physical features such as the effective diffusivity, run times, and network architecture.</description>

      <title>From bipedal to chaotic motion of chemically fueled partially wetting liquid drops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a thermodynamically consistent out-of-equilibrium continuum model to study the motion patterns of partially wetting liquid drops covered by autocatalytically reacting surfactants. When ambient chemostats feed a chemomechanical feedback loop involving a nonlinear reaction network, surface stresses caused by the Marangoni effect and the ensuing hydrodynamic motion, drops show a variety of increasingly complex biomimetic motility modes including shuttling, bipedal, rotational, intermittently chaotic and chaotic motion. We determine the corresponding nonequilibrium phase diagram and show that the complexity of the motion arises from competing length scales.</description>

      <title>Periodic Potential for Point Defects in a 2D Hexagonal Colloidal Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic dynamics of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal. Using a stochastic dynamical framework (evolution mechanics), we first extract the position-dependent drift vector and diffusion matrix from experimental trajectories, revealing dynamics that go beyond simple diffusion with constant coefficients. We then reconstruct a stochastic potential landscape by applying a periodic constraint and an equilibrium approximation within this framework. The energy differences between local minima in this landscape agree in order of magnitude with prior experimental estimates. Furthermore, analysis of the fit residuals under the equilibrium approximation provides evidence of nonequilibrium dynamics in di-vacancies. This work demonstrates how time-series analysis combined with this theoretical framework can uncover effective energy landscapes and assess detailed-balance violation in defect motion, providing a general approach for studying complex dynamics in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>

Abstract: The tunable mechanical response of knitted fabrics underpins applications ranging from soft robotics and artificial muscles to morphing electromagnetic field sensors. Elasticity in fabrics emerges from the bending of yarn in the knitted structure; however, properties beyond elasticity are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that knitted fabrics subjected to cyclic uniaxial stress exhibit significant hysteresis and the remarkable ability to "remember" their response to previous deformations -- reminiscent of classical return point memory in magnetic systems. The hysteretic behavior deviates from the two standard models of hysteresis that usually apply to solid-state materials, viscoelasticity and plasticity. Thus, we develop a phenomenological extension of the Preisach model of hysteresis which well replicates our data, and discuss implications of these results on the underlying mechanisms of memory in knitted fabrics.</description>

      <title>Informational Memory Shapes Collective Behavior in Intelligent Swarms</title>

Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of 2-D swarms in which collective behavior emerges from both direct local mechanical coupling between agents and from the exchange and processing of information between agents. Each agent, an air-table drone endowed with internal memory and a binary decision variable, updates its state by integrating a time series of memories of local past collisions. This internal computation transforms the drone swarm into a dynamical information network in which history-dependent feedback drives spontaneous complete spin polarization, pitchfork bifurcated spin collectives, and chaotic switching between collective states. By tuning the depth of memory and the decision algorithm, we uncover a memory-induced phase transition that breaks spin symmetry at the population level. A minimal theoretical model maps these dynamics onto an effective potential landscape sculpted by informational feedback, revealing how temporally correlated computation can replace instantaneous forces as the driver of collective organization, informed by experiments. These results position physically interacting drone swarms as a model system for exploring the physics of informational drone ensembles whose emergent behavior arises from the interplay between physical interaction and information processing.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape picture is a central tool to study many-body systems. In particular, the energy landscapes of glass-forming liquids, jammed packings, constraint satisfaction problems, or neural networks contain a plethora of minima corresponding to competing states. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction of minima originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales, a result that likely extends to a much broader family of problems.</description>

      <title>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short- or long-range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that antialign or even interact nonreciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and antiparallel flocking over run-and-chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random nonreciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here, the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. For infinite-range interaction, as soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions, the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random nonreciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium-size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multispecies flocking models with nonrandom but complex nonreciprocal interspecies interactions.</description>
