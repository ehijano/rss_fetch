      <title>A gap between two approaches of dimensional reduction for a six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, we would like to study the dimensional reduction issue of six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein extension in this paper. In particular, we will examine two possible approaches of dimensional reduction from six-dimensional spacetimes to four-dimensional ones. The first one is a direct dimensional reduction, i.e., from six-dimensional spacetimes directly to four-dimensional ones, via a $T^2\equiv S^1 \times S^1$ compactification, while the second one is an indirect dimensional reduction, i.e., from six-dimensional spacetimes to five-dimensional ones then four-dimensional ones, via two separated $S^1$ compactifications. Interestingly, we show that these two approaches lead to different four-dimensional effective actions although using the same six-dimensional metric. It could therefore address an important question of which approach is more reliable than the other.</description>

      <title>A First Look at "Continuous Spin" Gravity -- Time Delay Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that gravity is mediated by "continuous spin" particles, i.e., massless particles whose invariant spin scale $\rho_g$ is non-zero. In this case, the primary helicity-2 modes of gravitational radiation on a Minkowski background mix with a tower of integer-helicity partner modes under boosts, with $\rho_g$ controlling the degree of mixing. We develop a formalism for coupling spinless matter to continuous spin gravity at linearized level. Using this formalism, we calculate the time delay signatures induced by gravitational waves in an idealized laser interferometer detector. The fractional deviation from general relativity predictions is $O(\rho_g/\omega)$ for gravitational wave frequencies $\omega &gt;\rho_g$, and the effects of waves with $\omega \lesssim \rho_g$ are damped. The precision and low frequency ranges of gravitational wave detectors suggest potential sensitivity to spin scales at or below $\sim 10^{-14}$ eV at ground-based laser interferometers and $\sim 10^{-24}$ eV at pulsar timing arrays, motivating further analysis of observable signatures.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation in General Relativity and the 3+1 formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Significant challenges for astrophysical inference with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave observatories will achieve unprecedented strain sensitivities with an expanded observing band. They will detect ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers every year, the loudest of which will be in the band for $\approx 90$ minutes with signal-to-noise ratios $\approx 1500$. Current techniques will not be able to determine the astrophysical parameters of the loudest of next-gen BNS signals. We show that subtleties arising from the rotation of the Earth and the free-spectral range of gravitational-wave interferometers dramatically increases the complexity of next-gen BNS signals compared to the one-minute signals seen by LIGO--Virgo. Various compression methods currently relied upon to speed up the most expensive BNS calculations -- reduced-order quadrature, multi-banding, and relative binning -- will no longer be effective. We carry out reduced-order inference on a simulated next-gen BNS signal taking into account the Earth's rotation and the observatories' free-spectral range. We show that standard data compression techniques become impractical, and the full problem becomes computationally infeasible, when we include data below $\approx 16$Hz -- a part of the observing band that is critical for precise sky localisation. We discuss potential paths towards solving this complex problem.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion in the Schwarzschild spacetime in the Newtonian analogous construct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity-dependent Newtonian analogous potentials (NAPs) corresponding to general relativistic (GR) spacetimes accurately capture most of the relativistic features, including all classical tests of GR, effectively representing spacetime geometries in Newtonian terms. The NAP formulated by Tejeda \&amp; Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH, showing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further application, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a transonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime within the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining a typical single "saddle-type" sonic transition, a "saddle-spiral pair" is produced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) "spiral type" and the outer being a usual "saddle type." The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic radii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason for the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely due to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of velocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics framework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid's energy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that align with the spirit of TR13-like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR hydrodynamics. This could then essentially circumvent GR hydrodynamics or GR magnetohydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Mapping inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms of binary black holes from black hole perturbation waveforms by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying weak gravitational wave signals in noise and estimating the source properties require high-precision waveform templates. Numerical relativity (NR) simulations can provide the most accurate waveforms. However, it is challenging to compute waveform templates in high-dimensional parameter space using NR simulations due to high computational costs. In this work, we implement a novel waveform mapping method, which is an alternative approach to the existing analytical approximations, based on closed-form continuous-time neural networks. This machine-learning-based method greatly improves the efficiency of calculating waveform templates for arbitrary source parameters, such as the binary mass ratio and the spins of component black holes. Based on this method, we present \textit{BHP2NRMLSur}, a class of models (including nonspinning and spin-aligned ones) that maps point-particle black hole perturbation theory waveforms into NR and surrogate waveforms. The nonspinning model provides highly accurate waveforms that match the NR waveforms to the level of $\gtrsim 0.995$. The spin-aligned model reduces the required input parameters and hence improves the efficiency of the waveform generation -- it takes a factor of $\sim 50$ less time than existing NR surrogate models to generate $100,000$ waveforms, with a mismatch of $&lt;0.01$ compared to the NR waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration.</description>

      <title>Phase space structure of symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `Generalized Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity' (GSTG) does not admit diffeomorphic invariance, since the auxiliary field as well as the shift vector act as non-propagating dynamical variables carrying 1/2 degrees of freedom each. We show that in a minisuperspace model, which is devoid of the shift vector, the problem is alleviated for locally Lorentz invariant GSTG theory, and diffeomorphic invariance is established at least for one connection. However, the eerie structure of the Hamiltonian constructed even in the background of spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous Robertson-Walker space-time, can not be maneuvered. In contrast, the other two spatially flat connections containing an arbitrary time dependent function, doesn't admit non-linear extension to `Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR). We therefore construct the phase-space structure with three different spatially flat connections for the `Lorentz invariant' linear-scalar-vector-tensor GSTG action. Diffeomorphic invariance is established and the associated Hamiltonians are found to be well behaved for all the three cases.</description>

      <title>DeepGrav: Anomalous Gravitational-Wave Detection Through Deep Latent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach for gravitational wave anomaly detection, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional matched filtering techniques in identifying unknown waveform gravitational wave signals. We introduce a modified convolutional neural network architecture inspired by ResNet that leverages residual blocks to extract high-dimensional features, effectively capturing subtle differences between background noise and gravitational wave signals. This network architecture learns a high-dimensional projection while preserving discrepancies with the original input, facilitating precise identification of gravitational wave signals. In our experiments, we implement an innovative data augmentation strategy that generates new data by computing the arithmetic mean of multiple signal samples while retaining the key features of the original signals.
  In the NSF HDR A3D3: Detecting Anomalous Gravitational Wave Signals competition, it is honorable for us (group name: easonyan123) to get to the first place at the end with our model achieving a true negative rate (TNR) of 0.9708 during development/validation phase and 0.9832 on an unseen challenge dataset during final/testing phase, the highest among all competitors. These results demonstrate that our method not only achieves excellent generalization performance but also maintains robust adaptability in addressing the complex uncertainties inherent in gravitational wave anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Great Balls of FIRE IV. The contribution of massive star clusters to the astrophysical population of merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of over a hundred gravitational wave signals from double compacts objects have confirmed the existence of such binaries with tight orbits. Two main formation channels are generally considered to explain the formation of these merging binary black holes (BBHs): the isolated evolution of stellar binaries, and the dynamical assembly in dense environments, namely star clusters. Although their relative contributions remain unclear, several analyses indicate that the detected BBH mergers probably originate from a mixture of these two distinct scenarios. We study the formation of massive star clusters across time and at a cosmological scale to estimate the contribution of these dense stellar structures to the overall population of BBH mergers. To this end, we propose three different models of massive star cluster formation based on results obtained with zoom-in simulations of individual galaxies. We apply these models to a large sample of realistic galaxies identified in the $(22.1\ \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ cosmological volume simulation \firebox. Each galaxy in this simulation has a unique star formation rate, with its own history of halo mergers and metallicity evolution. Combined with predictions obtained with the Cluster Monte Carlo code for stellar dynamics, we are able to estimate populations of dynamically formed BBHs in a collection of realistic galaxies. Across our three models, we infer a local merger rate of BBHs formed in massive star clusters consistently in the range $1-10\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Compared with the local BBH merger rate inferred by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (in the range $17.9-44\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z=0.2$), this could potentially represent up to half of all BBH mergers in the nearby Universe. This shows the importance of this formation channel in the astrophysical production of merging BBHs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Quantum metasurfaces as probes of vacuum particle content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained far out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The array's response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes frequency shifts that are accessible in existing experimental setups. This feasibility stems from the system's unique ability to create coherent superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing the first practical platform for directly observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to explain the large amplitude of the nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational wave background observed in pulsar timing arrays (PTA), primordial sources must be particularly energetic. This is correlated to the generation of large density fluctuations, later collapsing into ultra-compact mini-halo (UCMHs). We demonstrate that if dark matter is made of WIMPs, then photon and neutrino fluxes from UCMHs produced by curvature peaks, first-order phase transition and domain wall interpretations of the PTA signal, exceed current bounds.</description>

      <title>Universal self-gravitating skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-gravitating skyrmion is an exact solution of the Einstein $SU(2)$-Skyrme model describing a topological soliton with baryon number $B=1$, living in a $4$-dimensional space-time in the presence of a cosmological constant. Here we show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the Euler angles parametrization, this solution can be generalized to include arbitrary values of the flavor number and, consequently, allowing higher values of the topological charge. Also, we show that higher-order corrections in the 't Hooft expansion can be considered while still preserving the analytical nature of the solutions. Finally we will show that from the gravitational solutions it is possible to construct skyrmions in flat space-time at a finite volume.</description>

      <title>Quantum superposition of boundary condition in $\mathrm{PAdS}_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the quantum superposition of boundary conditions in the context of the Poincar\'e patch of the two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space ($\mathrm{PAdS}_2$). Focusing on Robin (mixed) boundary conditions (RBC), we investigate the response function of the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector interacting with two or more scalar fields, each respecting a different boundary condition. The role of this quantum superposition is two-fold: i) it may represent different fields propagating on the same spacetime and interacting with an UDW detector or ii) it may describe an UDW detector on a superposition of spacetimes, each one with an inequivalent propagating field.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a dark matter particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an alternative quantization of the electromagnetic field around the Chern-Simons state $\psi_{CS}$ which is a zero energy solution of quantum electrodynamics. The solution determines a stochastic process which is a random perturbation of the self-duality equation for the electromagnetic potential ${\bf A}$. The stochastic process defines a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation with the initial condition $\psi_{CS}\chi$ where $\chi({\bf A})$ is an analytic function of ${\bf A}$ decaying fast at large ${\bf A}$. The method can be applied to a quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories by means of a stochastic self-duality equation. A quantization of massless spin 2 tensor fields (based on self-duality) and its extension to a quantization of gravity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kernel dependence of the Gaussian Process reconstruction of late Universe expansion history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss model-independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the late Universe. We use Gaussian Process Regression to reconstruct the evolution of various cosmological parameters such as H(z) and slow-roll parameter using observational data to train the GP model. We look at the GP reconstruction of these parameters using stationary and non-stationary kernel functions. We examine the effect of the choice of kernel functions on the reconstructions. We find that non-stationary kernels such as polynomial kernels might be a better choice for the reconstruction if the training data set is noisy (such as H(z) data) as it helps to avoid fitting the error in the data. We also look at the kernel dependence of other cosmological parameters such as the redshift of transition to the accelerated expansion. This has been achieved by reconstructing the derivatives of the expansion history (H(z)) such as the deceleration parameter/slow-roll parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axially symmetric accretion of low angular momentum hydrodynamic matter onto a rotating black hole. The gravitational field under consideration is assumed to be described by a pseudo-Newtonian Kerr potential. The accreting matter consists of different species defined by a relativistic equation of state with a variable adiabatic index.We construct and solve the hydrodynamical conservation equations governing such a flow, and find out the corresponding stationary integral solutions. We find that depending on the values of initial boundary conditions, accretion flow may exhibit multi-transonic behaviour, and a standing shock may form. We investigate, in minute detail, how the spin angular momentum of the black hole, as well as the composition of the accreting matter influence the dynamics of accretion flow and the astrophysics of shock formation in the aforementioned accreting black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Global hyperbolicity and manifold topology from the Lorentzian distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we seek characterizations of global hyperbolicity in smooth Lorentzian manifolds that do not rely on the manifold topology and that are inspired by metric geometry. In particular, strong causality is not assumed, so part of the problem is precisely that of recovering the manifold topology so as to make sense of it also in rough frameworks. After verifying that known standard characterizations do not meet this requirement, we propose two possible formulations. The first is based solely on chronological diamonds and is interesting due to its analogies with the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The second uses only properties of the Lorentzian distance function and it is suitable for extension to abstract `Lorentzian metric' frameworks. It turns out to be equivalent to the definition of `Lorentzian metric space' proposed in our previous joint work with S. Suhr, up to slightly strengthening weak $d$-distinction to `future or past $d$-distinction'. The role of a new property which we term `$d$-reflectivity' is also discussed. We then investigate continuity properties of the Lorentzian distance and the property of $d$-reflectivity in non-smooth frameworks. Finally, we establish a result of broader interest: the exponential map of a smooth spray is $C^{1,1}$ (smooth outside the zero section). Additionally, we derive a Lorentz-Finsler version of the Busemann-Mayer formula and demonstrate that, in strongly causal smooth Finsler spacetimes, the Finsler fundamental function can be reconstructed from the distance. As a consequence, distance-preserving bijections are shown to be Lorentz-Finsler isometries in the conventional smooth sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes (BBHs) started the hunt for their pre-merger electromagnetic emission. In that respect, numerical simulations have been looking for the "smoking gun" signal that could help identify pre-merger systems. Here we study if any of the expected features of circumbinary discs, such as the periodic modulation from the orbiting "lump", could be used to identify pre-merger BBHs or if they could be easily confused with other systems. Indeed, while the timing feature associated with the "lump" seems to be present for a large part of the parameter space defined by the binary separation and mass ratio in circular binaries, it was recently proposed to form thanks to an instability occurring naturally at the edge of accretion discs around single black holes (SBH). In order to check if features of a circumbinary disc could be reproduced by a SBH system, we search for at least one SBH fit able to replicate the given synthetic observations of a circumbinary disc. We found that many of the features from a circumbinary disc can be reproduced by a SBH system with different masses, distances or inner disc positions. Interestingly, while we can always find a SBH model providing a good enough fit to the data, the presence of two variabilities, associated with the lump and the binary, or binary-lump beat, period, is a necessary condition for a wide range of BBH system parameters and should be used as a test to disqualify some BBH candidates.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to ultralight bosonic dark matter using signal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to search for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM). Signals from ULBDM in such experiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A near-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal coherence time and sum the power across these segments. However, the signal coherence time can extend beyond a day, making it challenging to construct contiguous segments of such a duration due to detector instabilities. In this work, we present a novel detection statistic that can coherently extract ULBDM signals from segments of arbitrary durations. Our detection statistic, which we refer to as coherent SNR, is a weighed sum of data correlations, whose weights are determined by the expected signal correlations. We demonstrate that coherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses the performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical arguments and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work~\cite{Blas:2024duy} on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\) and surpass current constraints on the ULDM couplings to the Standard Model for masses \(m \lesssim 10^{-20}\, \mathrm{eV}\). Additionally, GW modulation could reveal solitons in extragalactic systems, particularly in more massive halos, highlighting the broad potential of GW-based methods for uncovering ULDM properties.</description>

      <title>Euclideanization without Complexification of the Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minkowski spacetime can be mapped by a series of projections in a higher-dimensional spacetime to a Euclidean space, constituting a process of Euclideanization shown here in detail for two dimensions. The result allows regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary values. However, there is no physical spacetime transformation that produces a Wick rotation. In avoiding this complexification process, the new Euclidenization procedure has important advantages in the transformations of the action principles, including fermionic fields and theories at constant chemical potential. In all cases, complex-valued amplitudes of the form $\exp(iS/\hbar)$ are mapped to real statistical weights $\exp(-S_{\rm E}/\hbar)$ with a Euclidean action $S_{\rm E}$. The procedure is also amenable to fields on curved background spacetimes as well as gravitational interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While wormholes may be just as good a prediction of Einstein's theory as black holes, they are subject to severe restrictions from quantum field theory. In particular, a wormhole can only be held open by violating the null energy condition, calling for the existence of "exotic matter." An equally serious problem is the enormous radial tension at the throat of a typical Morris-Thorne wormhole unless the wormhole has an extremely large throat size. It has been proposed that noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, may be the proper tool for addressing these issues. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to refine previous arguments to make a stronger and more detailed case for this proposal and (2) to obtain a complete wormhole solution from the given conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special exact solutions in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Removing the hypersurface orthogonal condition in the well studied Newman-Unti gauge, we obtain a generic asymptotic solution space which includes all possible origins of propagating degree of freedom. The asymptotic symmetry of the generalized system extends the Weyl-BMS symmetry by two independent local Lorentz transformations with non-trivial boundary charges, which reveals new boundary degrees of freedom. The generalized Newman-Unti gauge includes algebraically special condition in its most convenient form. Remarkably, the generic solutions satisfying the algebraically special condition truncate in the inverse power of radial expansions and the non-radial Newman-Penrose equations are explicitly solved at any order. Hence, we provide the most general algebraically special solution space and the derivation is self-contained in the Newman-Penrose formalism. The asymptotic symmetry with respect to the algebraically special condition is the standard Weyl-BMS symmetry and the symmetry parameters consist only the integration constant order. We present the Kerr solution and Taub-NUT solution in the generalized Newman-Unti gauge in a simple form.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation prevents singularity formation in collapse into a Hayward black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a (quantum mechanically) modified model for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario where the exterior of the collapsing dust ball is a Hayward black hole spacetime and the interior is a dust Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. This interior cosmology is entirely determined by the junction conditions with the exterior black hole. It turns out to be non-singular, displaying a power-law contraction which precedes a de Sitter phase or, reversely, a power-law expansion followed by a de Sitter era. We demonstrate that cosmic inflation in the collapse setting is a mechanism that decelerates collapsing matter, thereby preventing singularity formation. We also analyse the global causal structure and the viability of the model.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between two gravitational lens equations in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed a very accurate equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as OB equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] based on a relation found by Ohanian [Am. J. Phys. 55, 428 (1987)]. The OB equation was rediscovered later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and OB equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in the VE equation. Consequently, the VE equation can be improved by removing the unphysical branch. The improved version of the VE equation is found to be the same as the OB equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical differences when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous branes formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of brane formation in six-dimensional space. There is no a priori assumption of the brane(s) existence. However, the analysis of the generalized Einstein equations reveals that there are a set of metrics describing two static branes even in the absence of matter fields. The trapping of massive particles on branes is a consequence of the metric structure, which prevents these particles from moving between branes. It is shown that the communication between charged particles located on different branes provides by photons. Such positron-electron annihilation could be experimentaly study at the LHC collider. The Higgs field is distributed between the branes in such a way that it can serve as a Higgs portal connecting two worlds located on different branes. The values of the 4D physical parameters depend on the extra metric structure near the branes. A particular metric of the extra space was found to provide the observed value of the Higgs vacuum average. We also found a non-trivial effect of decompactification of the extra space when the Hubble parameter is varied.</description>

      <title>A relativistic theory of dark matter superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The groundwork for the theory of dark matter superfluidity has already been laid. The dynamics of the theory are determined from the non-relativistic $P(X)$ superfluid Lagrangian density which models MOND phenomenology when coupled to baryons on galactic scale. The same Lagrangian reduces to $\Lambda$CDM on cosmological scale at zeroth order. This suggests that cold dark matter undergo Bose-Einstein condensation in galaxies. In this paper, we extend the non-relativistic theory to include the relativistic corrections within the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. In addition to that, we explore how matter perturbations grow in the weak-field limit of the relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and optical properties of generalized Kerr-Schild spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) spacetimes in dimensions $n\geq 3$ and analyze their geometric and algebraic properties in a completely theory-independent setting. First, considering the case of a general null vector $\mathbf{k}$ defined by the GKS metric, we obtain the conditions under which it is geodesic. Assuming $\mathbf{k}$ to be geodesic for the remainder of the paper, we examine the alignment properties of the curvature tensors, namely the Ricci and Weyl tensors. We show that the algebraic types of the curvatures of the full (GKS) geometry are constrained by those of the respective background curvatures, thereby listing all kinematically allowed combinations of the algebraic types for the background and the full geometry. A notable aspect of these results is that, unlike the case of Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes, the Weyl types of the GKS spacetimes need not be type $II$ or more special. Then, focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf k$, we derive the conditions for it to satisfy the optical constraint, extending the previous results of KS spacetimes. We illustrate the general results using the example of (A)dS-Taub-NUT spacetimes in $n=4$, where we also comment on their KS double copy from a GKS perspective. Finally, as an application of our general results, we obtain the full family of GKS spacetimes with a geodesic, expanding, twistfree, and shearfree $\mathbf k$, satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations, and identify it with a subset of the higher-dimensional vacuum Robinson-Trautman solutions. In passing, we also determine the subcase of these solutions that manifests the KS double copy.</description>

Abstract: This study derives the mass spectrum and entropy of the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using the fractional Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The generalized fractional WDW equation is formulated using a fractional quantization map, demonstrating a correlation between the fractal mass dimension of the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust and L\'evy's fractional parameter $\alpha$ of the Riesz fractional quantum operator. These findings may provide new insights into the ramifications of the fractal behavior of cosmic structures in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Identification of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from Cosmic String Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe, unifying our knowledge of cosmology, and potentially unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an important opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) generated by cosmic strings. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguishing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. Therefore, we attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji significantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%. Although our discussion is based solely on simulated data, the relevant methods can provide data-driven analytical capabilities for future observations of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

We outline the main verdicts and recommendations deriving from this analysis, arguing that they not only fit the existing practice but are also more credible than those supported by prominent epistemological alternatives (e.g., Crowther et al. 2019, Dardashti et al. 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study free graviton entanglement between Rindler wedges in the Minkowski vacuum state via the Euclidean path integral. We follow Kabat's method for computing the conical entropy, using the heat kernel on the cone with the tip removed, whose resulting von Neumann entropy for photons correctly predicted electromagnetic edge modes. We find that, in addition to the bulk graviton contributions, the conical entropy has a contact term that can be attributed to a vector field anchored to the (d-2)-dimensional (Euclidean) Rindler horizon whose contribution equals d-2 times Kabat's contact term for photons. We suggest that graviton edge modes are hence the d-2 large diffeomorphisms which act internally within the Rindler horizon. Along the way, we address several known issues regarding graviton entanglement. We furthermore sketch how our results may be used to study edge modes in closed bosonic string theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreaction effect in optical solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons classically are stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by quantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution which can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The linearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often neglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this approximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoliubov approach, we find unstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable modes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate the backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading second order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon number in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode. Provided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the unstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical scenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the spectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and dark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an important role in future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton lasers, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstrom Gauss-Bonnet (RN-GB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with three horizon geometries (k=+1,0,-1) within the grand canonical ensemble. Using the recently developed topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, inspired by Duan's $\phi$-mapping theory, we analyze the black holes by treating both critical points in the phase diagram and black hole solutions as defects in the thermodynamic parameter space. Our results show that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the topological classification of RN-GB AdS black holes, distinguishing them from their RN AdS counterparts in the grand canonical ensemble, while aligning with their canonical ensemble counterparts. Complementary analyses of local stability using specific heat validate the implication of topological analysis. Furthermore, an evaluation of global stability via Gibbs free energy provides a comprehensive understanding on the system's phase structure. Notably, for k=+1, topological analysis suggests liquid-gas type phase transitions, whereas global analysis favors Hawking-Page transitions. For k=-1, topology indicates a single stable black hole branch, yet the global analysis reveals the presence of Hawking-Page transition.</description>

Abstract: The first observation of a gravitational wave (GW) and a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) emitted by the same binary neutron star (BNS) merger officially opened the field of GW multimessenger astronomy. In this paper, we define and address $\textit{lagging sirens}$, a new class of multimessenger BNSs for which associated GWs and sGRBs are observed without the identification of their host galaxy. We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these sources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution between GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host galaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs and sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift measure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used to infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics that differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and the distribution of the prompt time delays between GWs and sGRBs can be inferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers At Resonant Microwave Cavities</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we update the calculation of the sight distance for narrow-band detectors such as resonant microwave cavities, and the resulting maximal event rate. We find that the largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems. Even in the most optimistic setup, these events are anticipated to be extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of KN detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates: $\sim 1-9$ ($2-9$) yr$^{-1}$ in O4, and $13-110$ ($18-110$) yr$^{-1}$ in O5. Of these events, we expect to detect BNS (NSBH) KNe with DECam at a per year rate of: $0-2$ ($0$) in O4, and $2-28$ ($0-3$) in O5, conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable KN to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release our GW simulations and the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of simulated KNe to enable the astronomical community to use them in their multimessenger campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>Linearization (in)stabilities and crossed products</title>

Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>A robust cosmic standard ruler from the cross-correlations of galaxies and dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00202</link>

Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from dark sirens allow us to infer their locations and distances. Galaxies, on the other hand, have precise angular positions but no direct measurement of their distances -- only redshifts. The cross-correlation of GWs, which we limit here to binary black hole mergers (BBH), in spherical shells of luminosity distance $D_L$, with galaxies in shells of redshift $z$, leads to a direct measurement of the Hubble diagram $D_L(z)$. Since this standard ruler relies only on the statistical proximity of the dark sirens and galaxies (a general property of large-scale structures), it is essentially model-independent: the correlation is maximal when both redshift and $D_L$ shells coincide. We forecast the constraining power of this technique, which we call {\it{Peak Sirens}}, for run 5 (O5) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), as well as for the third-generation observatories Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We employ thousands of full-sky light cone simulations with realistic numbers for the tracers, and include masking by the Milky Way, lensing and inhomogeneous GW sky coverage. We find that the method is not expected to suffer from some of the issues present in other dark siren methods, such as biased constraints due to incompleteness of galaxy catalogs or dependence on priors for the merger rates of BBH. We show that with Peak Sirens, given the projected O5 sensitivity, LVK can measure $H_0$ with $7\%$ precision by itself, assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and $4\%$ precision using external datasets to constrain $\Omega_m$. We also show that future third-generation GW detectors can achieve, without external data, sub-percent uncertainties in $H_0$ assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and 3\% in a more flexible $w_0w_a$CDM model. The method also shows remarkable robustness against systematic effects such as the modeling of non-linear structure formation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06873</link>

Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>
