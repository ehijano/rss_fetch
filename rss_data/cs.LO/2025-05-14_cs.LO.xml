      <title>Games for graded modal substitution calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graded modal substitution calculus (GMSC) and its variants has been used for logical characterizations of various computing frameworks such as graph neural networks, ordinary neural networks and distributed computing. In this paper we introduce two different semantic games and formula size game for graded modal substitution calculus and its variants. Ultimately, we show that the formula size game characterizes the equivalence of classes of pointed Kripke models up to programs of GMSC of given size. Thus, the formula size game can be used to study the expressive power mentioned characterized classes of computing models. Moreover, we show that over words GMSC has the same expressive power as deterministic linearly tape-bounded Turing machines also known as deterministic linear bounded automata.</description>

      <title>A Bi-nested Calculus for Intuitionistic K: Proofs and Countermodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logic IK is the intuitionistic variant of modal logic introduced by Fischer Servi, Plotkin and Stirling, and studied by Simpson. This logic is considered a fundamental intuitionstic modal system as it corresponds, modulo the standard translation, to a fragment of intuitionstic first-order logic. In this paper we present a labelled-free bi-nested sequent calculus for IK. This proof system comprises two kinds of nesting, corresponding to the two relations of bi-relational models for IK: a pre-order relation, from intuitionistic models, and a binary relation, akin to the accessibility relation of Kripke models. The calculus provides a decision procedure for IK by means of a suitable proof-search strategy. This is the first labelled-free calculus for IK which allows direct counter-model extraction: from a single failed derivation, it is possible to construct a finite countermodel for the formula at the root. We further show the bi-nested calculus can simulate both the (standard) nested calculus and labelled sequent calculus, which are two best known calculi proposed in the literature for IK.</description>

      <title>Weighted Rewriting: Semiring Semantics for Abstract Reduction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel semiring semantics for abstract reduction systems (ARSs). More precisely, we provide a weighted version of ARSs, where the reduction steps induce weights from a semiring. Inspired by provenance analysis in database theory and logic, we obtain a formalism that can be used for provenance analysis of arbitrary ARSs. Our semantics handle (possibly unbounded) non-determinism and possibly infinite reductions. Moreover, we develop several techniques to prove upper and lower bounds on the weights resulting from our semantics, and show that in this way one obtains a uniform approach to analyze several different properties like termination, derivational complexity, space complexity, safety, as well as combinations of these properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wick's theorem is a cornerstone of perturbative quantum field theory. In this paper we announce and discuss the digitalization of Wick's theorem and its proof into the interactive theorem prover Lean 4 as part of the project PhysLean. We do the same for the static and normal-ordered versions of Wick's theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity and Properties of Preferential Propositional Dependence Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the complexity and properties of KLM-style preferential reasoning in the setting of propositional logic with team semantics and dependence atoms, also known as propositional dependence logic. Preferential team-based reasoning is shown to be cumulative, yet violates System~P. We give intuitive conditions that fully characterise those cases where preferential propositional dependence logic satisfies System~P. We show that these characterisations do, surprisingly, not carry over to preferential team-based propositional logic. Furthermore, we show how classical entailment and dependence logic entailment can be expressed in terms of non-trivial preferential models. Finally, we present the complexity of preferential team-based reasoning for two natural representations. This includes novel complexity results for classical (non-team-based) preferential reasoning.</description>

      <title>Boolean basis, formula size, and number of modal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is it possible to write significantly smaller formulae when using Boolean operators other than those of the De Morgan basis (and, or, not, and the constants)? For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt: formulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent formula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase in size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that elimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential number of occurrences of the modal operator $\lozenge$ and therefore of an exponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its extension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any complete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan basis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results are shown for the modal logic $\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\mathrm{K}$). We complement them showing that the modal logic $\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as propositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact on the size of formulae.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>A SAT-centered XAI method for Deep Learning based Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel formal SAT-based explanation model for deep learning in video understanding. The proposed method integrates SAT solving techniques with the principles of formal explainable AI to address the limitations of existing XAI techniques in this domain. By encoding deep learning models and video data into a logical framework and formulating explanation queries as satisfiability problems, the method aims to generate logic-based explanations with formal guarantees. The paper details the conceptual framework, the process of encoding deep learning models and video data, the formulation of "Why?" and "Why not?" questions, and a novel architecture integrating a SAT solver with a deep learning video understanding model. While challenges related to computational complexity and the representational power of propositional logic remain, the proposed approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the explainability of deep learning in the complex and critical domain of video understanding.</description>

      <title>Cubing for Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are exploring the problem of building an automated reasoning procedure that adaptively tunes the high-level solving strategy for a given problem. There are two main distinctive characteristics of our approach: tuning is performed solely online, unlike the common use of tuning as an offline process; and tuning data comes exclusively from the given instance, so we do not rely on the availability of similar benchmarks and can work with unique challenging instances. Our approach builds on top of the divide-and-conquer paradigm that naturally serves partitioned sub-problems for an automated tuning algorithm to obtain a good solving strategy. We demonstrate performance improvement on two classes of important problems--SAT-solving and neural network verification--and show that our method can learn unconventional solving strategies in some cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative paradigm for decentralized and secure data management across diverse application domains, including healthcare, supply chain management, and the Internet of Things. Its core features, such as decentralization, immutability, and auditability, achieved through distributed consensus algorithms and cryptographic techniques, offer significant advantages for multi-stakeholder applications requiring transparency and trust. However, the inherent complexity and security-critical nature of blockchain systems necessitate rigorous analysis and verification to ensure their correctness, reliability, and resilience against potential vulnerabilities.</description>
