      <title>Disorder-Induced Spectral Splitting versus Rabi Splitting under Strong Light-Matter Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of strong light-matter coupling is typically associated with the observation of Rabi splitting, corresponding to the formation of the hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, this relationship is derived based on the assumption that disorder can be ignored or acts as a perturbative effect. Contrary to conventional treatment of disorder effects, we investigate the impact of strong disorder on the absorption spectrum by developing a non-perturbative effective model combined with classical electrodynamics simulation. Intriguingly, we find that strong disorder leads to an enhanced spectral splitting that closely resembles Rabi splitting, yet originates from a fundamentally different mechanism as induced by the dark modes. Specifically, we examine a disordered molecular ensemble in proximity to a plasmonic nanodisk and demonstrate disorder-induced spectral splitting in the absorption spectrum. This conclusion raises a controversial issue, suggesting that both polaritons (dominate in the strong coupling regime) and dark modes (dominate in the strong disorder regime) can lead to spectral splitting, and one cannot distinguish them solely based on the steady-state absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Accuracy of XPS Calculations: Exploring Hybrid Basis Set Schemes for CVS-EOMIP-CCSD Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable computational methodologies and basis sets for modeling x-ray spectra are essential for extracting and interpreting electronic and structural information from experimental x-ray spectra. In particular, the trade-off between numerical accuracy and computational cost due to the size of the basis set is a major challenge, since molecular orbitals undergo extreme relaxation in the core-hole state. To gain clarity on changes in electronic structure induced by the formation of a core-hole, the use of sufficiently flexible basis for expanding the orbitals, particularly for the core region, has been shown to be essential. This work focuses on the refinement of core-hole ionized state calculations using the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) family of methods through an extensive analysis on the effectiveness of "hybrid" and mixed basis sets. In this investigation, we utilize the CVS-EOMIP-CCSD method in combination and construct hybrid basis sets piece-wise from readily available Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets in order to calculate x-ray ionization energies for a set of small gas phase molecules. Our results provide insights into the impact of basis sets on CVS-EOMIP-CCSD calculations of K-edge ionization energies of first-row p-block elements. These insights enable us to understand more about the basis set dependence of the core IEs computed and allow us to establish a protocol for deriving reliable and cost-effective theoretical estimates for computing IEs of small molecules containing such elements.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Operator Learning for Molecular Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a systematic approach to predict the structure and thermodynamic properties of chemical systems through the single-molecule density profiles. Whereas the statistical-mechanical framework is theoretically rigorous, its practical applications are often constrained by challenges in formulating a reliable free-energy functional and the complexity of solving multidimensional integro-differential equations. In this work, we established an optimized operator learning method that effectively separates the high-dimensional molecular density profile into two lower-dimensional components, thereby exponentially reducing the vast input space. The convoluted operator learning network demonstrates exceptional learning capabilities, accurately mapping the relationship between the density profile of a carbon dioxide system to its one-body direct correlation function using an atomistic polarizable model. The neural operator model can be generalized to more complex systems, offering high-precision cDFT calculations at low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Quantum Linear Response with a Polarizable Embedding environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising avenue for solving complex problems, particularly in quantum chemistry, where it could accelerate the computation of molecular properties and excited states. This work focuses on hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for near-term quantum devices, combining the quantum linear response (qLR) method with a polarizable embedding (PE) environment. We employ the self-consistent operator manifold of quantum linear response (q-sc-LR) on top of a unitary coupled cluster (UCC) wave function in combination with a Davidson solver. The latter removes the need to construct the entire electronic Hessian, improving computational efficiency when going towards larger molecules. We introduce a new superposition-state-based technique to compute Hessian-vector products and show that this approach is more resilient towards noise than our earlier gradient-based approach. We demonstrate the performance of the PE-UCCSD model on systems such as butadiene and para-nitroaniline in water and find that PE-UCCSD delivers comparable accuracy to classical PE-CCSD methods on such simple closed-shell systems. We also explore the challenges posed by hardware noise and propose simple error correction techniques to maintain accurate results on noisy quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Boosting electrode performance and bubble management via Direct Laser Interference Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-structuring techniques like Direct Laser Interference Patterning show great potential for optimizing electrodes for water electrolysis. Therefore, a systematic experimental study based on statistical design of experiments is performed to analyze the influence of the spatial period and the aspect ratio between spatial period and structure depth on the electrode performance for pure Ni electrodes. The electrochemically active surface area could be increased by a factor of 12 compared to a non-structured electrode. For oxygen evolution reaction, a significantly lower onset potential and overpotential ($\approx$-164 mV at 100 mA/cm$^2$) is found. This is explained by a lower number of active nucleation sites and, simultaneously, larger detached bubbles, resulting in reduced electrode blocking and thus, lower ohmic resistance. It is found that the spatial distance between the laser-structures is the decisive processing parameter for the improvement of the electrode performance.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate property prediction is crucial for accelerating the discovery of new molecules. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable success, their performance often relies on large amounts of labeled data that are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Thus, there is a growing need for models that can perform well with limited experimentally-validated data. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated molecular property labels are scarce. MoleVers adopts a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, the model learns molecular representations from large unlabeled datasets via masked atom prediction and dynamic denoising, a novel task enabled by a new branching encoder architecture. In the second stage, MoleVers is further pretrained using auxiliary labels obtained with inexpensive computational methods, enabling supervised learning without the need for costly experimental data. This two-stage framework allows MoleVers to learn representations that generalize effectively across various downstream datasets. We evaluate MoleVers on a new benchmark comprising 22 molecular datasets with diverse types of properties, the majority of which contain 50 or fewer training labels reflecting real-world conditions. MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art results on 20 out of the 22 datasets, and ranks second among the remaining two, highlighting its ability to bridge the gap between data-hungry models and real-world conditions where practically-useful labels are scarce.</description>

      <title>Electron correlation effects and spin-liquid state in the Herbertsmithite Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ real-space variational quantum Monte Carlo methods with resonating valence bond many-body wave functions to investigate electron correlation effects in the Kagome system $Zn_xCu_{4-x}O_6$. Using three trial wave functions of the Slater-Jastrow type, where (i) only the Jastrow correlation factor is optimized and the orbitals obtained by density functional theory, (ii) both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized, and (iii) additionally the Slater determinant is substituted by an antisymmetrized-geminal power wave function, we analyze static and dynamic correlation energies across concentrations $x=0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1$. Our results show that the correlation energy increases with the concentration of $Zn_x$. Optimizing the Slater determinant significantly enhances the correlation energy by approximately $\sim -73(4) mHa$ per electron. Eventually, the emergence of a quantum spin liquid state driven by a long-range correlation energy is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Perspective of Exciton Condensation from Particle-hole Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton condensation, the Bose-Einstein-like condensation of quasibosonic particle-hole pairs, has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental interest and holds promise for ultra-energy-efficient technologies. Recent advances in bilayer systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, have brought us closer to the experimental realization of exciton condensation without the need for high magnetic fields. In this perspective, we explore progress towards understanding and realizing exciton condensation, with a particular focus on the characteristic theoretical signature of exciton condensation: an eigenvalue greater than one in the particle-hole reduced density matrix, which signifies off-diagonal long-range order. This metric bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental realizations by providing a unifying framework that connects exciton condensation to related phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity. Furthermore, our molecular approach integrates exciton condensation with broader excitonic phenomena, including exciton-related entanglement and correlation, unlocking potential advancements in fields like quantum materials and energy transport. We discuss connections between recent experimental and theoretical work and highlight the discoveries that may arise from approaching exciton condensation from a molecular perspective.</description>

      <title>QUEST\#4X: an extension of QUEST\#4 for benchmarking multireference wavefunction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a number of datasets for evaluating the performance of single reference methods for the low-lying excited states of closed-shell molecules, a comprehensive dataset for assessing the performance of multireference methods for the low-lying excited states of open-shell systems is still desired. For this reason, we propose an extension (QUEST\#4X) of the radial subset of QUEST\#4 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 3720] to cover 110 doublet and 39 quartet excited states. Near-exact results obtained by iCIPT2 (iterative configuration interaction with selection and second-order perturbation correction) are taken as benchmark to calibrate SDSCI (static-dynamic-static configuration interaction) and SDSPT2 (static-dynamic-static second-order perturbation theory), which are minimal MRCI and CI-like perturbation theory, respectively. It is found that SDSCI is very close in accuracy to ic-MRCISD (internally contracted multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles), although its computational cost is just that of one iteration of the latter. Unlike most variants of MRPT2, SDSPT2 treats single and multiple states in the same way, and performs similarly as MS-NEVPT2 (multi-state n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory). These findings put SDSCI and SDSPT2 on a firm basis.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical instanton theory for reaction rates at any temperature: How a rigorous real-time derivation solves the crossover temperature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instanton theory relates the rate constant for tunneling through a barrier to the periodic classical trajectory on the upturned potential energy surface whose period is $\tau=\hbar/(k_{\rm B}T)$. Unfortunately, the standard theory is only applicable below the "crossover temperature", where the periodic orbit first appears. This paper presents a rigorous semiclassical ($\hbar\to0$) theory for the rate that is valid at any temperature. The theory is derived by combining Bleistein's method for generating uniform asymptotic expansions with a real-time modification of Richardson's flux-correlation function derivation of instanton theory. The resulting theory smoothly connects the instanton result at low temperature to the parabolic correction to Eyring transition state theory at high-temperature. Although the derivation involves real time, the final theory only involves imaginary-time (thermal) properties, consistent with the standard version of instanton theory. Therefore, it is no more difficult to compute than the standard theory. The theory is illustrated with application to model systems, where it is shown to give excellent numerical results. Finally, the first-principles approach taken here results in a number of advantages over previous attempts to extend the imaginary free-energy formulation of instanton theory. In addition to producing a theory that is a smooth (continuously differentiable) function of temperature, the derivation also naturally incorporates hyperasymptotic (i.e. multi-orbit) terms, and provides a framework for further extensions of the theory.</description>

Abstract: Accurate charge densities are essential for reliable electronic structure calculations because they significantly impact predictions of various chemical properties and in particular, according to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, atomic forces. This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different DFT exchange-correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densitites that are nearly basis set error free. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are for instance needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is essential for studying dynamical properties in condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and complex materials, yet it poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge. Our work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by accurately capturing many-body correlations. Therefore, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which are enhanced through neural networks parameterizations. To compute the optimal time-dependent parameters, we utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique and a new method based on Taylor-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>DiffBatt: A Diffusion Model for Battery Degradation Prediction and Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery degradation remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of green technologies and sustainable energy solutions. Despite significant research efforts, predicting battery capacity loss accurately remains a formidable task due to its complex nature, influenced by both aging and cycling behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel general-purpose model for battery degradation prediction and synthesis, DiffBatt. Leveraging an innovative combination of conditional and unconditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance and transformer architecture, DiffBatt achieves high expressivity and scalability. DiffBatt operates as a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty in aging behaviors and a generative model to simulate battery degradation. The performance of the model excels in prediction tasks while also enabling the generation of synthetic degradation curves, facilitating enhanced model training by data augmentation. In the remaining useful life prediction task, DiffBatt provides accurate results with a mean RMSE of 196 cycles across all datasets, outperforming all other models and demonstrating superior generalizability. This work represents an important step towards developing foundational models for battery degradation.</description>
