      <title>Parenthood Penalties in Academia: Childcare Responsibilities, Gender Role Beliefs and Institutional Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite progress toward gender parity, women remain underrepresented in academia, particularly in senior research positions. This study investigates the role of parenthood in shaping gender disparities in academic careers, focusing on the complex interplay between gender, childcare responsibilities, gender role beliefs, institutional support, and scientists' career achievements. Using a large-scale survey of 5,670 U.S. and Canadian academics, supplemented with bibliometric data from Web of Science, it reveals that childcare responsibilities significantly mediate gender disparities in both subjective and objective academic achievements, with women assuming a disproportionate share of childcare duties. In particular, women shoulder a greater caregiving load when their partners are employed full-time outside academia. However, egalitarian gender role beliefs have been playing an important role in shifting this structure by transforming women academics' behaviors. As women's egalitarian gender role beliefs strengthen, their childcare responsibilities tend to diminish-an effect not mirrored in men. Institutional parental support policies show mixed effects. While flexible work schedules and childcare support can mitigate the negative association between childcare responsibilities and career outcomes of women academics, policies such as tenure clock extensions and paternity leave may inadvertently intensify it. Addressing these disparities necessitates a comprehensive approach that integrates shifts in individual attitudes, broader sociocultural changes, and policy improvements.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

      <title>Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates adversarial attacks, a concept from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an adversarial optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.</description>
