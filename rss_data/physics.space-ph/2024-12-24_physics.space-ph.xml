      <title>Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. Previously tentatively identified as Alfv\'enic solitons, these structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around 30-40 solar radii and declining at greater distances, suggesting that they decay. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 solar radii), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfv\'enic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures propagate sunward in the plasma frame, distinguishing them from typical solar wind fluctuations. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.</description>

      <title>Exponential Tethers for Accelerated Space Elevator Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exponential space elevator is a space elevator with a tether cross-section that varies exponentially with altitude. With such an elevator it is possible to reel in tether material at one end of the elevator while reeling out at the other end, without changing the overall taper profile. I show how to use this property to build up or clone a space elevator much more efficiently than with standard climber-based methods.</description>

      <title>Corotation-bounce resonance of ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Banded energy distributions of H$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, S$^{+++}$, and O$^+$ or S$^{++}$ ions between 100 eV to ~20 keV are consistently observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere mapping to M-shells between M=10-20. The bands correspond to flux enhancements at similar speeds for different ion species, providing the first evidence of simultaneous bounce-resonant acceleration of multiple ion species in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ion enhancements occur for energies at which the bounce frequencies of the trapped ions matched integer harmonics of the System-III corotation frequency. The observations highlight a previously unknown interaction between corotation and bounce motion of &lt;10 keV energy ions that is a fundamental and persistent process occurring in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Turbulent multicomponent magnetopause: Analytical description and kinetic simulation of complex distributed current sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out particle-in-cell simulations of complex current sheets of the family of analytically found Vlasov--Maxwell equilibria that model a collisionless magnetopause and allow for arbitrary energy distributions and countercurrents of various particle component. We find that, depending on the parameters, i)~a weak small-scale bending-type instability is always present at the sharp low-density plasma boundary of such a magnetopause, and ii)~the development of a small-scale Weibel-type instability inside a magnetopause is either excluded or possible. Both cases are studied and compared for two variants of the particle energy distribution~ -- Maxwellian and Kappa. The long-term stability of the whole current sheet is observed either without or with saturated Weibel-type turbulence, which can be generated in a low-magnetized region between neighboring countercurrents. We point out the applicability of the developed model of distributed current sheets and the results of analysis of their small-scale instability for the description of physical phenomena in the magnetopauses of planets and late-type stars.</description>
