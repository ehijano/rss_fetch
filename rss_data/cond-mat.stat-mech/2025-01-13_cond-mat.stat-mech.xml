      <title>Deep learning of phase transitions with minimal examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of neural networks and deep learning methods to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ behave analogously to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model, when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We apply histogram reweighting to the neural network prediction and compare its capabilities when trained more conventionally at multiple temperatures. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in Quenched Random Environments: Reviving Laplace's First Law of Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplace's first law of errors, which states that the frequency of an error can be represented as an exponential function of the error magnitude, was overlooked for many decades but was recently shown to describe the statistical behavior of diffusive tracers in isordered, glassy-like media. While much is known about this behavior, a key ingredient is still missing: the relationship between this observation and diffusion in a quenched random environment. We address this problem using the trap model, deriving lower and upper bounds on the particle packet for large displacements. Our results demonstrate that both bounds exhibit Laplace-like laws. We further establish a connection between the density of energy traps $\rho(E)$, and the observed behavior, showing that the phenomenon is truly universal, albeit with constants that depend on temperature and the level of disorder.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of two-component mean-field Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the structure of the phase diagram of the two-component mean-field Bose mixture at finite temperatures, considering both the cases of attractive and repulsive interspecies interactions. In particular, we analyze the evolution of the phase diagram upon driving the system towards collapse and point out its distinctive features in this limit. We provide analytical insights into the global structure of the phase diagram and the properties of the phase transitions between the normal phase and the phases involving Bose-Einstein condensates. \emph{Inter alia} we analytically demonstrate that for sufficiently weak interspecies interactions $a_{12}$ the system generically exhibits a line of quadruple points but has no triple nor tricritical points in the phase diagram spanned by the chemical potentials $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ and temperature $T$. In contrast, for sufficiently large, positive values of $a_{12}$, the system displays both triple and tricritical points but no quadruple points. As pointed out in recent studies, in addition to the phase transitions involving condensation, the mixture may be driven through a liquid-gas type transition, and we clarify the conditions for its occurrence. We finally discuss the impact of interaction- and mass-imbalance on the phase diagram of the mixture.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling in the ageing dynamics of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two-time auto-correlator converges, when deep into the finite-size regime.</description>

      <title>Exploring Metastability in Ising models: critical droplets, energy barriers and exit time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the research on the metastable behavior of the Ising model. We analyze the transition times from the set of metastable states to the set of the stable states by identifying the critical configurations that the system crosses with high probability during this transition and by computing the energy barrier that the system must overcome to reach the stable state starting from the metastable one. We describe the dynamical phase transition of the Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics across various contexts, including different lattices, dimensions and anisotropic variants. The analysis is extended to related models, such as long-range Ising model, Blume-Capel and Potts models, as well as to dynamics like Kawasaki dynamics, providing insights into metastability across different systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. We investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase on the Nishimori line becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. This result underscores the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. Furthermore, we argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These findings reveal fundamentally different properties of the ferromagnetic phase in models with correlation in disorder compared to those without.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.</description>

      <title>Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum-entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, have become indispensable tools for modeling pairwise interactions in disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their remarkable success, these methods often overlook high-order interactions that may be crucial in complex systems. Conversely, while modern machine learning approaches can capture such interactions, existing interpretable frameworks are computationally expensive, making it impractical to assess the relevance of high-order interactions in real-world scenarios. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations via hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. Here, we present a method that maps RBMs exactly onto generalized Potts models with interactions of arbitrary high order. This approach leverages large-$N$ approximations, facilitated by the simple architecture of the RBM, to enable the efficient extraction of effective many-body couplings with minimal computational cost. This mapping also enables the development of a general formal framework for the extraction of effective higher-order interactions in arbitrarily complex probabilistic models. Additionally, we introduce a robust formalism for gauge fixing within the generalized Potts model. We validate our method by accurately recovering two- and three-body interactions from synthetic datasets. Additionally, applying our framework to protein sequence data demonstrates its effectiveness in reconstructing protein contact maps, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results position RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for investigating high-order interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A strong-coupling effective-field theory for asymmetrically charged plates with counterions only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in rationalizing the phenomenon of like-charge attraction between charged bodies, such as a pair of colloids, in the strong coupling regime. The two colloids are modelled as uniformly charged parallel plates, neutralized by mobile counterions. In an earlier work [Palaia et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 126, 3143 (2022)], we developed an effective-field theory for symmetric plates, stemming from the ground-state description that holds at infinite couplings. Here, we generalize the approach to the asymmetric case, where the plates bear charges of the same sign, but of different values. In the symmetric situation, the mobile ions, which are localized in the vicinity of the two plates, share equally between both of them. Here, the sharing is non-trivial, depending both on the coupling parameter and the distance between the plates. We thus introduce a counterion occupation parameter, that is determined variationally to ensure minimum of the free energy. The resulting analytical results for the pressure as a function of the plate-plate distance $d$ agree well with our Monte Carlo data, in a large interval of strong and intermediate coupling constants $\Xi$. We show in particular that within this description, there exists a range of large distances at which the attractive pressure features a $1/d^2$ behavior.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation, where a single input $x$ is mapped to a single output $y$. In prior work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a minimal cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff between these three resources. Our result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" with implications for the relationship between the Second Law and the Physical Church-Turing thesis.</description>

      <title>Effect of shape anisotropy on percolation of aligned and overlapping objects on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation transition of aligned, overlapping, anisotropic shapes on lattices. Using the recently proposed lattice version of excluded volume theory, we show that shape-anisotropy leads to some intriguing consequences regarding the percolation behavior of anisotropic shapes. We consider a prototypical anisotropic shape - rectangle - on a square lattice and show that for rectangles of width unity (sticks), the percolation threshold is a monotonically decreasing function of the stick length, whereas, for rectangles of width greater than two, it is a monotonically increasing function. Interestingly, for rectangles of width two, the percolation threshold is independent of its length. We show that this independence of threshold on the length of a side holds for d-dimensional hypercubiods as well for specific integer values for the lengths of the remaining sides. The limiting case of the length of the rectangles going to infinity shows that the limiting threshold value is finite and depends upon the width of the rectangle. This 'continuum' limit with the lattice spacing tending to zero only along a subset of the possible directions in d-dimensions results in a novel 'semi-continuum' percolation system. We show that similar results hold for other anisotropic shapes and lattices in different dimensions. The critical properties of the aligned and overlapping rectangles are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the threshold values given by the lattice-excluded volume theory are in good agreement with the simulation results, especially for larger rectangles. Our results show that shape-anisotropy of the aligned, overlapping percolating units has a marked influence on the percolation properties, especially when a subset of the dimensions of the percolation units are made to diverge.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of stability of metastable states in the presence of L\'{e}vy noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The barrier-crossing event for superdiffusion characterized by symmetric L\'{e}vy flights is analyzed. Starting from the fractional Fokker-Planck equation, we derive an integro-differential equation along with the necessary conditions to calculate the mean residence time of a particle within a fixed interval. We consider an arbitrary smooth potential profile, particularly metastable, with a sink and L\'{e}vy noise characterized by both an arbitrary index $\alpha$ and arbitrary noise intensity parameter. For the specific case of L\'{e}vy flights with an index $\alpha = 1$ and a cubic metastable potential, a closed expression for the mean residence time is obtained in quadratures. The analytical results reveal an enhancement of the mean residence time in the metastable state due to the influence of L\'{e}vy noise.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Legendre Transform, Canonical Ensemble and Jaynes' Maximum Entropy Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legendre transform between thermodynamic quantities such as the Helmholtz free energy and entropy plays a key role in the formulation of the canonical ensemble. In the standard treatment, the transform exchanges the independent variable from the system's internal energy to its conjugate variable -- the inverse temperature of the heat reservoir. In this article, we formulate a microscopic version of the transform between the free energy and Shannon entropy of the system, where the conjugate variables are the microstate probabilities and the energies (scaled by the inverse temperature). The present approach gives a non-conventional perspective on the connection between information-theoretic measure of entropy and thermodynamic entropy. We focus on the exact differential property of Shannon entropy, utilizing it to derive central relations within the canonical ensemble. Thermodynamics of a system in contact with the heat reservoir is discussed in this framework. Other approaches, in particular, Jaynes' maximum entropy principle is compared with the present approach.</description>

      <title>On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of inter-species interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the relaxation of the distribution functions to equilibrium is shown through entropy dissipation. Some numerical simulations are included to investigate the trend to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Local Order Controls the Onset of Oscillations in the Nonreciprocal Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying nontrivial spatiotemporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium trapped states and a loss of ergodic behavior via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the nonreciprocal Ising model beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and the triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Hilbert space fragmentation in the quantum East model: fragmentation, subspace-restricted quantum scars, and effects of density-density interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the complete fragmentation structure of this model by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration and utilizing the transfer matrix method. We show that the growth of the size of each fragment of the model follows the widely studied Dyck sequence, and is therefore analytically tractable with the help of Catalan triangles. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space which exhibits Poisson statistics of the energy level spacing, an examination of various quantities restricted to the largest fragments shows that a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization holds. This weaker violation of the ETH within the largest fragments is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars due to quantum fragmentation. Next, we show that the inclusion of a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength $V$ induces a spectral transition within the largest fragment from a weakly ETH-violating phase containing scars to a statistical bubble localized phase as $V$ increases. In particular, the $V\to \infty$ limit produces an integrable model. We find that the addition of finite-$V$ stabilizes the ground state near half-filling while keeping intact the fragmentation structure of the East model. However, this behavior abruptly changes exactly at $V = \infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure. The infinite-$V$ model has many interesting properties, among which the appearance of the ground state and the largest fragment at two different filling fractions is specially noteworthy. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model as a particular limit of a special kind of $t-V$ model with an on-site potential.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed, both in the latter case and in the case of almost-sure exit. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the exit probability and the mean first-return time at the origin coincide with the values obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.</description>

Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>

      <title>Social adaptive behavior and oscillatory prevalence in an epidemic model on evolving random geometric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic amply shows that spatial effects like the mobility of agents and average interpersonal distance, together with the adaptation of agents, are very important in deciding the outcome of epidemic dynamics. Structural and dynamical aspects of random geometric graphs are widely employed in describing processes with a spatial dependence, such as the spread of an airborne disease. In this work, we investigate the interplay between spatial factors, such as agent mobility and average interpersonal distance, and the adaptive responses of individuals to an ongoing epidemic within the framework of random geometric graphs. We show that such spatial factors, together with the adaptive behavior of the agents in response to the prevailing level of global epidemic, can give rise to oscillatory prevalence even with the classical SIR framework. We characterize in detail the effects of social adaptation and mobility of agents on the disease dynamics and obtain the threshold values. We also study the effects of delayed adaptive response of agents on epidemic dynamics. We show that a delay in executing non-pharmaceutical spatial mitigation strategies can amplify oscillatory prevalence tendencies and can have non-linear effects on peak prevalence. This underscores the importance of early implementation of adaptive strategies coupled with the dissemination of real-time prevalence information to manage and control the epidemic effectively.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced First Order Transition to Collective Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the transition to collective motion in assemblies of aligning self-propelled particles remains a long-standing matter of debate. In this article, we focus on dry active matter and show that weak fluctuations suffice to generically turn second-order mean-field transitions into a `discontinuous' coexistence scenario. Our theory shows how fluctuations induce a density-dependence of the polar-field mass, even when this effect is absent at mean-field level. In turn, this dependency on density triggers a feedback loop between ordering and advection that ultimately leads to an inhomogeneous transition to collective motion and the emergence of inhomogeneous travelling bands. Importantly, we show that such a fluctuation-induced first order transition is present in both metric models, in which particles align with neighbors within a finite distance, and in `topological' ones, in which alignment is based on more complex constructions of neighbor sets. We compute analytically the noise-induced renormalization of the polar-field mass using stochastic calculus, which we further back up by a one-loop field-theoretical analysis. Finally, we confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of fluctuating hydrodynamics as well as of topological particle models with either k-nearest neighbors or Voronoi alignment.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify ($\textit{herald}$) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Gears in Chemical Reaction Networks: Optimizing Energy Transduction Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomena when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modelling competition for space: Emergent inefficiency and inequality due to spatial self-organization among a group of crowd-avoiding agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition for a limited resource is the hallmark of many complex systems, and often, that resource turns out to be the physical space itself. In this work, we study a novel model designed to elucidate the dynamics and emergence in complex adaptive systems in which agents compete for some spatially spread resource. Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that inefficiency in utilizing physical space shows transition at a specific density and peaks at another distinct density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the variation of inefficiency relative to the information accessible to the agents exhibits contrasting behavior above and below this second density. We also look into the inequality of resource sharing in the model and show that although inefficiency can be a non-monotonic function of information depending upon the parameters of the model, inequality, in general, decreases with information. Our study sheds light on the role of competition, spatial constraints, and agent traits within complex adaptive systems, offering insights into their emergent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. In this study, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.</description>
