      <title>Universal scaling solution for a rigidity transition: renormalization group flows near the upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigidity transitions induced by the formation of system-spanning disordered rigid clusters, like the jamming transition, can be well-described in most physically relevant dimensions by mean-field theories. However, we lack a theoretical description of these kinds of rigidity transitions that can detect an upper critical dimension below which mean-field theory fails and predict corrections to the theory in and below this upper critical dimension. Towards that end, we show that the critical exponents for a continuous isotropic rigidity transition predicted by a simple dynamical effective medium theory (the Coherent Potential Approximation, CPA) are not mean-field-like, dimension-independent quantities. Instead, we find that the theory has an upper critical dimension $d_{u}=2$, in which there are the usual logarithmic corrections and below which the critical exponents are modified. We recapitulate Ken Wilson's phenomenology of the $(4-\epsilon)$-dimensional Ising model, but with the upper critical dimension reduced to $2$. We interpret this using normal form theory as a transcritical bifurcation in the RG flows, and posit their explicit forms, incorporating a dangerously irrelevant variable becoming marginal in $d=2$. We also derive universal scaling functions from the CPA sufficient to predict all linear response in randomly diluted isotropic elastic systems. These results indicate the types of corrections one expects to disordered rigidity transitions in $2$ dimensions and provide a pathway to understanding the critical phenomena in such systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-body finite element model for hydrogel packings: Linear response to shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-body finite element model of a packing of hydrogel particles using the Flory-Rehner constitutive law to model the deformation of the swollen polymer network. We show that while the dependence of the pressure, $\Pi$, on the effective volume fraction, $\phi$, is virtually identical to a monolithic Flory material, the shear modulus, $\mu$, behaves in a non-trivial way. $\mu$ increases monotonically with $\Pi$ from zero and remains below about $80\%$ of the monolithic Flory value at the largest $\Pi$ we study here. The local shear strain in the particles has a large spatial variation. Local strains near the centers of the particles are all roughly equal to the applied shear strain, but the local strains near the contact facets are much smaller and depend on the orientation of the facet. We show that the slip between particles at the facets depends strongly on the orientation of the facet and is, on average, proportional to the component of the applied shear strain resolved onto the facet orientation. This slip screens the stress transmission and results in a reduction of the shear modulus relative to what one would obtain if the particles were welded together at the facet. Surprisingly, given the reduction in the shear modulus arising from the facet slip, and the spatial variations in the local shear strain inside the particles themselves, the deformation of the particle centroids is rather homogeneous with the strains of the Delaunay triangles having fluctuations of only order $\pm 5\%$. These results should open the way to construction of quantitative estimates of the shear modulus in highly compressed packings via mean-field, effective-medium type approaches.</description>

      <title>An asymptotically consistent morphoelastic shell model for compressible biological structures with finite-strain deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an asymptotically consistent morphoelastic shell model to describe the finite deformations of biological tissues using the variational asymptotical method. Biological materials may exhibit remarkable compressibility when under large deformations, and we take this factor into account for accurate predictions of their morphoelastic changes. The morphoelastic shell model combines the growth model of Rodriguez et al. and a novel shell model developed by us. We start from the three-dimensional (3D) morphoelastic model and construct the optimal shell energy based on a series expansion around the middle surface. A two-step variational method is applied that retains the leading-order expansion coefficient while eliminating the higher-order ones. The main outcome is a two-dimensional (2D) shell energy depending on the stretching and bending strains of the middle surface. The derived morphoelastic shell model is asymptotically consistent with three-dimensional morphoelasticity and can recover various shell models in literature. Several examples are shown for the verification and illustration.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin equation for a tagged monomer in a Gaussian semiflexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the motion of a tagged monomer within a Gaussian semiflexible polymer model. We carefully derived the generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) that governs the motion of a tagged central monomer. This derivation involves integrating out all the other degrees of freedom within the polymer chain, thereby yielding an effective description of the viscoelastic motion of the tagged monomer. A critical component of our analysis is the memory kernel that appears in the GLE. By examining this kernel, we characterized the impact of bending rigidity on the non-Markovian diffusion dynamics of the tagged monomer. Furthermore, we calculated the mean-squared displacement of the tagged monomer using the derived GLE. Our results not only show remarkable agreement with previously known results in certain limiting cases but also provide dynamic features over the entire timescale.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional memory in sheared granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore what features of multi-dimensional training can be remembered in granular materials, the response of a small, two-dimensional packing of hydrogel spheres to two independent types of shear is measured. Packings are trained via the application of several identical shear cycles, either of a single shear type or combinations of the two types. The memory is then read out using a standard protocol capable of revealing memories as a cusp at the point where readout reaches the training strain. The ability to read out a memory is sensitive not only to the type of deformation applied but also to the order in which different types of training are performed. These results underscore the importance of thinking of memories not as single remembered value (amplitude) but as a learned path through phase space.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Clusters as models for chiral active micromotors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular swimmers with tunable orbit radius and chirality are gaining attention due to their potential to illustrate novel collective phases in simulations and synthetic and biological active matter. Here, we present a facile experimental strategy for fabricating active rotors using chemically cross-linked clusters of Janus colloids. Janus clusters are propelled by induced charge electrophoresis in an alternating electric field. We demonstrate capillary-assisted assembly as a feasible path toward expanding the fabrication process to get large amounts of uniform circular clusters. Systematic studies of the Janus clusters reveal circular motion with tunable angular velocity, orbit radius, and chirality and a relation between the radius of gyration of the cluster and their rotational dynamics. Importantly, clusters with uniform azimuthal angles behave distinctly exhibiting larger orbit radii, while those with random angles exhibit higher angular velocities and smaller radii. We also validate the kinetic model for clusters beyond dimers. Collectively, our studies highlight that Janus clusters as promising candidates as controlled circular rotors with tunable properties and, hence in the future, will facilitate studies on the collective behaviors of synthetic chiral rotors.</description>

      <title>Tethered flexible polymer under oscillatory linear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium structural and dynamical properties of a flexible polymer tethered to a reflecting wall and subject to oscillatory linear flow are studied by numerical simulations. Polymer is confined in two dimensions and is modeled as a bead-spring chain immersed in a fluid described by the Brownian multiparticle collision dynamics. At high strain, the polymer is stretched along the flow direction following the applied flow, then recoils at flow inversion before flipping and elongate again. When strain is reduced, it may happen that the chain recoils without flipping when the applied shear changes sign. Conformations are analyzed and compared to stiff polymers revealing more compact patterns at low strains and less stretched configurations at high strain. The dynamics is investigated by looking at the center-of-mass motion which shows a frequency doubling along the direction normal to the external flow. The center-of-mass correlation function is characterized by smaller amplitudes when reducing bending rigidity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical arrest in active nematic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting arrested flow patterns in extensile systems. Our results reveal a mechanism of labyrinthine pattern formation produced by an emergent topology of nematic domain walls that partially suppresses chaotic flows. Taken together, our findings call for the experimental realization of defect-free active nematics, and suggest that topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for viscoelasticity of soft jammed solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscoelastic properties of soft jammed solids, such as foams, emulsions, and soft colloids, have been the subject of experiments, with particular interest in the anomalous viscous loss. However, a microscopic theory to explain these experimental results is still lacking. Here, we develop an effective medium theory that incorporates the effects of contact damping. The theory explains experimentally observed viscoelastic properties, particularly attributing the anomalous viscous loss to marginal stability in amorphous systems. This work establishes a microscopic theory for describing the impact of damping on soft jammed solids and their viscoelastic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Membrane Dynamics Induced by Active Protein Interactions and Chemical Reactions: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomembranes wrapping cells and organelles are not only the partitions that separate the insides but also dynamic fields for biological functions accompanied by membrane shape changes. In this review, we discuss the spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations of membranes under nonequilibrium conditions. In particular, we focus on theoretical analyses and simulations. Protein active forces enhance or suppress the membrane fluctuations; the membrane height spectra are deviated from the thermal spectra. Protein binding or unbinding to the membrane is activated or inhibited by other proteins and chemical reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis. Such active binding processes can induce traveling waves, Turing patterns, and membrane morphological changes. They can be represented by the continuum reaction-diffusion equations and discrete lattice/particle models with state flips. The effects of structural changes in amphiphilic molecules on the molecular-assembly structures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic constitutive curves and shear banding in dry and wet granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use particle simulations to map comprehensively the shear rheology of dry and wet granular matter, in both fixed pressure and fixed volume protocols. At fixed pressure we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thinning, whereas at fixed volume we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thickening. We show that the presence of one non-monotonicity does not imply the other. Instead, there exists a signature in the volume fraction measured under fixed pressure that, when present, ensures non-monotonic constitutive curves at fixed volume. In the context of dry granular flow we show that gradient and vorticity bands arise under fixed pressure and volume respectively, as implied by the constitutive curves. For wet systems our results are consistent with a recent experimental observation of shear thinning at fixed pressure. We furthermore predict discontinuous shear thickening in the absence of critical load friction.</description>

      <title>Optical Micromanipulation of Soft Materials: Applications in Devices and Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its invention by Arthur Ashkin and colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1970s, optical micromanipulation, also known as optical tweezers or laser tweezers, has evolved remarkably to become one of the most convenient and versatile tools for studying soft materials, including biological systems. Arthur Ashkin received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for enabling these extraordinary scientific advancements. Essentially, a focused laser beam is used to apply and measure minuscule forces from a few piconewtons to femtonewtons by utilizing light-matter interaction at mesoscopic length scales. Combined with advanced microscopy and position-sensing techniques, optical micromanipulations enable us to investigate diverse aspects of functional soft materials. These include studying mechanical responses through force-elongation measurements, examining the structural properties of complex fluids employing microrheology, analyzing chemical compositions using spectroscopy, and sorting cells through single-cell analysis. Furthermore, it is utilized in various soft-matter-based devices, such as laser scissors and optical motors in microfluidic channels. This chapter presents an overview of optical micromanipulation techniques by describing fundamental theories and explaining the design considerations of conventional single-trap and dual-trap setups as well as recent improvisations. We further discuss their capabilities and applications in probing exotic soft-matter systems and in developing widely utilized devices and technologies based on functional soft materials.</description>

      <title>Viologen-based supramolecular crystal gels: gelation kinetics and sensitivity to temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supramolecular crystal gels, a subset of molecular gels, form through self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators into interconnecting crystalline fibers, creating a three-dimensional soft solid network. This study focuses on the formation and properties of viologen-based supramolecular crystalline gels. It aims to answer key questions about the tunability of network properties and the origin of these properties through in-depth analyses of the gelation kinetics triggered by thermal quenching. Experimental investigations, including UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, rheology, microscopy and scattering measurements, contribute to a comprehensive and self-consistent understanding of the system kinetics. We confirm that the viologen-based gelators crystallize into nanometer radius hollow tubes that assemble into micro to millimetric spherulites. We then show that the crystallization follows the Avrami theory and is based on pre-existing nuclei. We also establish that the growth is interface controlled leading to the hollow tubes to branch into spherulites with fractal structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the gel properties can be tuned depending on the quenching temperature. Lowering the temperature results in the formation of denser and smaller spherulites. In contrast, the gels elasticity is not significantly affected by the quench temperature, leading us to hypothesize that the spherulites densification occurs at the expense of the connectivity between spherulite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical behavior of binary mixtures consisting of highly charged colloidal particles is studied by means of Brownian dynamics simulations. We investigate differently sized, but identically charged particles with nearly identical interactions between all species in highly dilute suspensions. Different short-time self-diffusion coefficients induce, mediated by electrostatic interactions, a coupling of both self and collective dynamics of differently sized particles: The long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a larger species are increased by the presence of a more mobile, smaller species and vice versa. Similar coupling effects are observed in collective dynamics where in addition to the time constant of intermediate scattering function's initial decay its functional form, quantified by exponents of a stretched exponential decay, are influenced by the presence of a differently sized species. We provide a systematic analysis of coupling effects in dependence on the ratio of sizes, number densities, and the strength of electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a collection of simulations of the Edwards-Anderson lattice spin glass at $T=0$ to elucidate the nature of low-energy excitations over a range of dimensions that reach from physically realizable systems to the mean-field limit. Using heuristic methods, we sample ground states of instances to determine their energies while eliciting excitations through manipulating boundary conditions. We exploit the universality of the phase diagram of bond-diluted lattices to make such a study in higher dimensions computationally feasible. As a result, we obtain a verity of accurate exponents for domain wall stiffness and finite-size corrections that allow us to examine their dimensional behavior and their connection with predictions from mean-field theory. We also provide an experimentally testable prediction for the thermal-to-percolative crossover exponent in dilute lattices Ising spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Binding and dimerization control phase separation in a compartment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.</description>

Abstract: Voltage distribution in sub-cellular micro-domains such as neuronal synapses, small protrusions or dendritic spines regulates the opening and closing of ionic channels, energy production and thus cellular homeostasis and excitability. Yet how voltage changes at such a small scale in vivo remains challenging due to the experimental diffraction limit, large signal fluctuations and the still limited resolution of fast voltage indicators. Here, we study the voltage distribution in nano-compartments using a computational approach based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the electro-diffusion motion of ions, where inward and outward fluxes are generated between channels. We report a current-voltage (I-V) logarithmic relationship generalizing Nernst law that reveals how the local membrane curvature modulates the voltage. We further find that an influx current penetrating a cellular electrolyte can lead to perturbations from tens to hundreds of nanometers deep depending on the local channels organization. Finally, we show that the neck resistance of dendritic spines can be completely shunted by the transporters located on the head boundary, facilitating ionic flow. To conclude, we propose that voltage is regulated at a subcellular level by channels organization, membrane curvature and narrow passages.</description>

      <title>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular structure</title>

Abstract: We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation (filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching between air-filled and evacuated states.</description>

      <title>Explaining the spread in measurement of PDMS elastic properties: influence of test method and curing protocol</title>

Abstract: Accuracy in the measurement of mechanical properties is essential for precision engineering and for the interrogation of composition-property relationships. Conventional methods of mechanical testing, such as uniaxial tension, compression, and nanoindentation, provide highly repeatable and reliable results for stiff materials, for which they were originally developed. However, when applied to the characterization of soft and biological materials, the same cannot be said, and the spread of reported properties of similar materials is vast. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), commonly obtained from Dow as SYLGARD 184, is a ubiquitous such material, which has been integral to the rapid development of biocompatible microfluidic devices and flexible electronics in recent decades. However, reported shear moduli of this material range over 2 orders of magnitude for similar chemical compositions. Taking advantage of the increased mechanical scrutiny afforded to SYLGARD 184 in recent years, we combine both published and new experimental data obtained using 9 mechanical test methods. A statistical analysis then elucidates the significant bias induced by the test method itself, and distinguishes this bias from the influence of curing protocols on the mechanical properties. The goal of this work is thus two-fold: (i) it provides a quantitative understanding of the different factors that influence reported properties of this particular material, and (ii) it serves as a cautionary tale. As researchers in the field of mechanics strive to quantify the properties of increasingly complex soft and biological materials, converging on a standardized measurement of PDMS is a necessary first step.</description>

Abstract: According to excess-entropy scaling, dynamic properties of liquids like viscosity and diffusion coefficient are determined by the entropy. This link between dynamics and thermodynamics is increasingly studied and of interest also for industrial applications, but hampered by the challenge of calculating entropy efficiently. Utilizing the fact that entropy is basically the Kolmogorov complexity, which can be estimated from optimal compression algorithms [Avinery et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 178102 (2019); Martiniani et al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 011031 (2019)], we here demonstrate that the diffusion coefficients of four simple liquids follow a quasiuniversal exponential function of the optimal compression length of a single equilibrium configuration. We conclude that "complexity scaling" has the potential to become a useful tool for estimating dynamic properties of any liquid from a single configuration.</description>

      <title>Multicell-Fold: geometric learning in folding multicellular life</title>

Abstract: During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the correlated orientational disordered phase of entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystalline solids with lack of orientational ordering serve the purpose of studying the disordered systems with many fundamental applications in contemporary research. Despite the orientational disorder, the constituent particles sometime follow some conserved laws or correlation while maintaining the translational order depicted by the crystal structure. Such phase is called ``correlated orientational disordered'' phase in the crystal. Polyhedral particles in the presence of hard-core interaction provide a great opportunity to study the orientational order and disorder in entropy driven self-assembly. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetry of the polyhedral particles and cubic crystalline structures exhibiting the correlated disordered phases, which are obtained from the simulations of single-component systems. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure appear to be directly connected with the existence of multiple unique orientations satisfying a few other orientational features. In this phase, the systems exhibit orientationally frozen states at sufficiently higher packing fractions and discrete orientational hopping at comparatively lower ones while all the signatures of the correlation are preserved. This symmetry relationship appears to control all the aspects of orientational correlation in the crystalline solids which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered phases with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity suppresses intermittency in direct turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity (also Hall or gyro-viscosity), which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>
