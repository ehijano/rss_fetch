      <title>Investigating the missing wedge problem in small-angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography across real and reciprocal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is a technique for studying anisotropic nanostructures of millimeter-sized samples in a volume-resolved manner. It requires the acquisition of data through repeated tomographic rotations about an axis which is subjected to a series of tilts. The tilt that can be achieved with a typical setup is geometrically constrained, which leads to limits in the set of directions from which the different parts of the reciprocal-space map can be probed. Here, we characterize the impact of this limitation on reconstructions in terms of the missing wedge problem of tomography, by treating the problem of tensor tomography as the reconstruction of a three-dimensional field of functions on the unit sphere, represented by a grid of Gaussian radial basis functions. We then devise an acquisition scheme to obtain complete data by remounting the sample, which we apply to a sample of human trabecular bone. Performing tensor tomographic reconstructions of limited data sets as well as the complete data set, we further investigate and validate the missing wedge understanding of data incompleteness by investigating reconstruction errors due to data incompleteness across both real and reciprocal space. Finally, we carry out an analysis of orientations and derived scalar quantities, to quantify the impact of this missing wedge problem on a typical tensor tomographic analysis. We conclude that the effects of data incompleteness are consistent with the predicted impact of the missing wedge problem, and that the impact on tensor tomographic analysis is appreciable but limited, especially if precautions are taken. In particular, there is only limited impact on the means and relative anisotropies of the reconstructed reciprocal space maps.</description>

      <title>Fast Monte Carlo Dose Calculation in Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the critical role of fast Monte Carlo dose calculations in advancing proton therapy techniques, particularly in the context of increasing treatment customization and precision. As adaptive radiotherapy and other patient-specific approaches evolve, the need for accurate and precise dose calculations, essential for techniques like proton-based stereotactic radiosurgery, becomes more prominent. These calculations, however, are time-intensive, with the treatment planning/optimization process constrained by the achievable speed of dose computations. Thus, enhancing the speed of Monte Carlo methods is vital, as it not only facilitates the implementation of novel treatment modalities but also improves the optimality of treatment plans. Today, the state-of-the-art in Monte Carlo dose calculation speeds is 106 - 107 protons per second. This review highlights the latest advancements in fast Monte Carlo dose calculations that have led to such speeds, including emerging artificial intelligence-based techniques, and discusses their application in both current and emerging proton therapy strategies.</description>

      <title>Tunable dynamical tissue phantom for laser speckle imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to design and implement a tunable dynamical tissue phantom for laser speckle-based in-vivo blood flow imaging. This approach relies on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to control a piezoelectric actuator which, upon illuminated with a laser source, generates speckles of pre-defined probability density function and auto-correlation. The validation experiments show that the phantom can generate dynamic speckles that closely replicate both surfaces as well as deep tissue blood flow for a reasonably wide range and accuracy.</description>

      <title>X-ray Interferometry Using a Modulated Phase Grating: Theory and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray grating interferometry allows for the simultaneous acquisition of attenuation, differential-phase contrast, and dark-field images, resulting from X-ray attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering, respectively. The modulated phase grating (MPG) interferometer is a recently developed grating interferometry system capable of generating a directly resolvable interference pattern using a relatively large period grating envelope function that is sampled at a pitch that allows for X-ray spatial coherence using a microfocus X-ray source or by use of a source G0 grating that follows the Lau condition. We present the theory of the MPG interferometry system for a 2-dimensional staggered grating, derived using Fourier optics, and we compare the theoretical predictions with experiments we have performed with a microfocus X-ray system at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LSU. The theoretical and experimental fringe visibility is evaluated as a function of grating-to-detector distance. Quantitative experiments are performed with porous carbon and alumina samples, and qualitative analysis of attenuation and dark-field images of a dried anchovy are shown.</description>

      <title>Metric-guided Image Reconstruction Bounds via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have led to novel imaging systems and algorithms that address ill-posed problems. Assessing their trustworthiness and understanding how to deploy them safely at test time remains an important and open problem. We propose a method that leverages conformal prediction to retrieve upper/lower bounds and statistical inliers/outliers of reconstructions based on the prediction intervals of downstream metrics. We apply our method to sparse-view CT for downstream radiotherapy planning and show 1) that metric-guided bounds have valid coverage for downstream metrics while conventional pixel-wise bounds do not and 2) anatomical differences of upper/lower bounds between metric-guided and pixel-wise methods. Our work paves the way for more meaningful reconstruction bounds. Code available at https://github.com/matthewyccheung/conformal-metric</description>

      <title>Quasistatic approximation in neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00486v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and explain the quasistatic approximation (QSA) as applied to field modeling for electrical and magnetic stimulation. Neuromodulation analysis pipelines include discrete stages, and QSA is applied specifically when calculating the electric and magnetic fields generated in tissues by a given stimulation dose. QSA simplifies the modeling equations to support tractable analysis, enhanced understanding, and computational efficiency. The application of QSA in neuro-modulation is based on four underlying assumptions: (A1) no wave propagation or self-induction in tissue, (A2) linear tissue properties, (A3) purely resistive tissue, and (A4) non-dispersive tissue. As a consequence of these assumptions, each tissue is assigned a fixed conductivity, and the simplified equations (e.g., Laplace's equation) are solved for the spatial distribution of the field, which is separated from the field's temporal waveform. Recognizing that electrical tissue properties may be more complex, we explain how QSA can be embedded in parallel or iterative pipelines to model frequency dependence or nonlinearity of conductivity. We survey the history and validity of QSA across specific applications, such as microstimulation, deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise definition and explanation of QSA in neuromodulation are essential for rigor when using QSA models or testing their limits.</description>
