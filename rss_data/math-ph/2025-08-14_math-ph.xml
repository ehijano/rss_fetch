      <title>Universal Deformations in Compressible Isotropic Cauchy Elastic Solids with Residual Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate universal deformations in compressible isotropic Cauchy elastic solids with residual stress, without assuming any specific source for the residual stress. We show that universal deformations must be homogeneous, and the associated residual stresses must also be homogeneous. Since a non-trivial residual stress cannot be homogeneous, it follows that residual stress must vanish. Thus, a compressible Cauchy elastic solid with a non-trivial distribution of residual stress cannot admit universal deformations. These findings are consistent with the results of \citet{YavariGoriely2016}, who showed that in the presence of eigenstrains, universal deformations are covariantly homogeneous and in the case of simply-connected bodies the universal eigenstrains are zero-stress (impotent).</description>

      <title>Confluent hypergeometric kernel determinant on multiple large intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confluent hypergeometric point process represents a universality class which arises in a variety of different but related areas. It particularly describes the local statistics of eigenvalues in the bulk of spectrum near a Fisher-Hartwig singular point for a broad class of unitary ensembles. It is the aim of this work to investigate large gap asymptotics of this process over a union of disjoint intervals $\cup_{j=0}^{n}(sa_j,sb_j)$, where $a_0&lt;b_0&lt;\dots&lt;a_m&lt;0&lt;b_m&lt;\dots&lt;a_n&lt;b_n$ for some $0\leq m \leq n$. As $s\to +\infty$, we establish a general asymptotic formula up to and including the oscillatory term of order $1$, which involves a $\theta$-functions-combination integral along a linear flow on an $n$-dimensional torus. If the linear flow has ``good Diophantine properties'' or the ergodic properties, we further improve the error estimate or the leading term for the asymptotics of the integral. These results can be combined for the case $n=1$, which lead to a precise large gap asymptotics up to an undetermined constant.</description>

      <title>Improper currents in theories with local invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof that the currents arising from Noether's first theorem in a physical theory with local invariance can always be decomposed into two terms, one of them vanishing on-shell, and the other having an off-shell vanishing divergence, or that they are improper, using the original terminology of Noether. We also prove that, when there is a current which is covariantly conserved, it differs from the canonical current by an improper current. Both proofs are performed in the most general case, that is, for arbitrary maximal order of the derivatives of the dynamical fields of the theory in the Lagrangian, and for arbitrary maximal order of the derivatives of the parameters of the symmetry transformations present in the infinitesimal transformations of the fields and spacetime coordinates. Both proofs are made using only elementary calculus, making them accessible to a large number of physicists.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Theory Approach to Ordered Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified kinetic theory for ordered fluids, which systematically extends the phase space with the appropriate generalized angular momenta. Our theory yields a uniquely determined mesoscopic model for any continuum with microstructure that is characterized by Capriz's order parameter manifold. We illustrate our theory with three running examples: liquids saturated with non-diffusive gas bubbles, liquids composed of calamitic (rodlike) molecules, and liquids composed of calamitic molecules with additional head-to-tail symmetry. We discuss the symmetries of the microscopic interactions via Noether's theorem, and use them to characterize the conserved quantities mesoscopic dynamics. We derive the mesoscopic model for ordered fluids from a kinetic point of view assuming that the microscopic interactions are of weak nature, when it comes to the ordering of the fluid. Lastly, we discuss under which conditions an H-theorem result holds at the mesoscopic scale and for which Vlasov potential we can expect the emergence of collective behavior.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

      <title>$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>

      <title>A supergroup series for knot complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three variable series invariant $F_K (y,z,q)$ for plumbed knot complements associated with a Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)$. The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of data- and image- domain LSRTM under velocity-impedance parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches, thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic impedance is found to work well.</description>

      <title>Kinematical Lie algebras and symplectic symmetric spaces I: Lie algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of kinematical Lie algebra introduced in physics for the classification of the various possible relativity algebras an isotropic spacetime can accommodate.
  We first give an elementary proof of the fact that such a generalized kinematical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ always carries a canonical structure of symplectic involutive Lie algebra (shortly ``siLa''). In other words, if $G$ is a connected Lie group admitting $\mathfrak{g}$ as Lie algebra, there always exists a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$ constituted by the elements of $G$ that are fixed under an involutive automorphism of $G$ and such that the homogenenous space $M=G/H$ is a symplectic symmetric space. In particular, the manifold $M$ canonically carries a $G$-invariant linear torsionfree connection $\nabla$ whose geodesic symmetries centered at all points extend as global $\nabla$-affine transformations of $M$. The manifold $M$ is also canonically equipped with a symplectic structure $\omega$ which is invariant under every geodesic symmetry, implying in particular that it is parallel w.r.t the linear connection: $\nabla\omega=0$.
  In a second part, we give a complete description of the fine structure of our generalized siLa's. Our discussion yields a complete classification of such sila's.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of Equations of Motion from Symmetries in Quantum-Mechanical Systems via Heisenberg's Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the construction of equations of motion based on symmetries in quantum-mechanical systems, using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a minimal foundation. From canonical operators, two spaces of conjugate operators are constructed, along with a third space derived from the former, which includes the ``Symmetry-Dilation'' operator. When this operator commutes with the main equation of motion, it defines the set of observables compatible with a complete basis of operators (symmetry generators), organized into a Lie algebra dependent on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle within Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, by requiring the dilation operator to commute with the central operator, the wavefunction is constrained, thereby constructing known structures. Specific cases are derived -- relativistic, non-relativistic, and a lesser-studied case: ``ultra-relativistic (Carroll-Schr\"odinger)''. Our work may open new avenues for understanding and classifying symmetries in quantum mechanics, as well as offer an alternative method for deriving equations of motion and applying them to complex scenarios involving exotic particles.</description>

      <title>Decoded Quantum Interferometry Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum optimization algorithm that exploits sparsity in the Fourier spectrum of objective functions, with the potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms on suitably structured problems. While highly promising in idealized settings, its resilience to noise has until now been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of DQI under noise, focusing on local depolarizing noise. For the maximum linear satisfiability problem, we prove that, in the presence of noise, performance is governed by a noise-weighted sparsity parameter of the instance matrix, with solution quality decaying exponentially as sparsity decreases. We demonstrate this decay through numerical simulations on two special cases: the Optimal Polynomial Intersection problem and the Maximum XOR Satisfiability problem. The Fourier-analytic methods we develop can be readily adapted to other classes of random Pauli noise, making our framework applicable to a broad range of noisy quantum settings and offering guidance on preserving DQI's potential quantum advantage under realistic noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the general construction of a twist of bigraded Hopf algebras by skew bicharacters to obtain two-parameter quantum groups in the Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld (for affine types), and FRT (for both finite and affine) presentations from their standard one-parameter versions. This yields new elementary proofs of the fundamental results on two-parameter quantum groups that appeared in the literature over the last two decades, and also leads to natural generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases.</description>

      <title>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on heat kernels of finite particle systems of Keller-Segel type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Magic angle (in)stability and mobility edges in disordered Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why do experiments only observe one magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene, despite standard models like the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian predicting an infinite number? In this article, we explore the relative stability of larger magic angles compared to smaller ones. Specifically, we analyze how disorder impacts these angles as described by the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian in the chiral limit. Changing focus, we investigate the topological and transport properties of a specific magic angle under disorder. We identify a mobility edge near the flat band energy for small disorder, showing that this mobility edge persists even when all Chern numbers are zero. This persistence is attributed to the system's $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, which enables non-trivial sublattice transport. Notably, this effect remains robust beyond the chiral limit and near perfect magic angles, aligning with experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: We give fundamental solutions of arbitrarily sized matrix Fuchsian linear systems, in the case where the coefficients $B^{(i)}$ of the systems are matrix solutions of the Schlesinger system that are upper triangular, and whose eigenvalues follow an arithmetic progression of a rational difference. The values on the superdiagonals of the matrices $B^{(i)}$ are given by contour integrals of meromorphic differentials defined on Riemann surfaces obtained by compactification of superelliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spin Gromov-Witten (GW) theory of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Using the standard torus action on $\mathbb{P}^1$, we prove that the associated equivariant potential can be expressed by means of operator formalism and satisfies the 2-BKP hierarchy. As a consequence of this result, we prove the spin analogue of the GW/Hurwitz correspondence of Okounkov-Pandharipande for $\mathbb{P}^1$, which was conjectured by J. Lee. Finally, we prove that this correspondence for a general target spin curve follows from a conjectural degeneration formula for spin GW invariants that holds in virtual dimension 0.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to study isometries of the $1$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups endowed with horizontally strictly convex norms. Well-known examples of horizontally strictly convex norms on Carnot groups are the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ endowed with the Heisenberg-Kor\'anyi norm, or with the Naor-Lee norm; and $H$-type Iwasawa groups endowed with a Kor\'anyi-type norm. We prove that on a general Carnot group there always exists a horizontally strictly convex norm. The main result of the paper says that if $(\mathbf{G},N_{\mathbf{G}})$ is a Carnot group where $N_{\mathbf{G}}$ is a horizontally strictly convex norm on $\mathbf{G}$, then the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ is isometrically rigid. That is, for every isometry $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})\to\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ there exists an isometry $\psi:\mathbf{G}\to \mathbf{G}$ such that $\Phi=\psi_{\#}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic Yang-Mills heat equation on the two-dimensional torus. Using regularity structures, Chandra, Chevyrev, Hairer, and Shen previously proved both the local well-posedness and gauge-covariance of this model. In this article, we revisit their results using para-controlled calculus. One of the main ingredients is a new coordinate-invariant perspective on vector-valued stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity as a Gauge Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity (ECG) as a cubic gauge theory of gravity via abelian gauge and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local {\it non}-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Dynamical Decoupling for (Almost) Any Spin-Boson Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a technique aimed at suppressing the interaction between a quantum system and its environment by applying frequent unitary operations on the system alone. In the present paper, we analytically study the dynamical decoupling of a two-level system coupled with a structured bosonic environment initially prepared in a thermal state. We find sufficient conditions under which dynamical decoupling works for such systems, and, most importantly, we find bounds for the convergence speed of the procedure. Our analysis is based on a new Trotter theorem for multiple Hamiltonians and involves a rigorous treatment of the evolution of mixed quantum states via unbounded Hamiltonians. A comparison with numerical experiments shows that our bounds reproduce the correct scaling in various relevant system parameters. Furthermore, our analytical treatment allows for quantifying the decoupling efficiency for boson baths with infinitely many modes, in which case a numerical treatment is unavailable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's ``moving wall'' model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are \emph{pairwise isocausal} on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections between the models and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion for when the isocausality descends to the compactified spacetimes. In the absence of equivariance, the covering result does not imply global isocausality, and at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Optimal Transport and Applications in Fluid Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.</description>

      <title>Invariance of subbundles and nonholonomic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>On the independent set polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two new contributions to the study of the independence polynomial $Z_G(z)$ of a finite simple graph $G = (V,E)$. First, we provide an improved lower bound for the zero-free region of $Z_G(z)$ for the important class of claw-free graphs. Our bound exceeds the classical Shearer radius and it is derived through a refined application of the Fern\'andez-Procacci criterion using properties of the local neighborhood structure in claw-free graphs. Second, we establish a novel combinatorial expression for $Z_G(z)$, inspired by the connection with the abstract polymer gas models in statistical mechanics, which offers a new structural interpretation of the polynomial and may be of independent interest. These results strengthen the connection between statistical physics, combinatorics, and graph theory, and suggest new approaches for analytic exploration.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of two-dimensional determinantal processes associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new class of determinantal point processes in the complex plane coming from the ground state of free fermions associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators. These processes generalize the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory. We prove a two-term Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotic expansion for the Laplace transform of smooth linear statistics. This implies a law of large number and central limit theorem for the empirical field. The limiting variance includes both contributions from the bulk and boundary of the droplet. The boundary fluctuations depend on the Hamiltonian dynamics associated with the underlying operator and, generally, are not conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>Measures and Trajectory Properties in Oscillator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [43], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [49].</description>
