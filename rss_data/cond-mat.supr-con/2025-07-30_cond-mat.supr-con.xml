      <title>Topological indicators for systems with open boundaries: Application to the Kitaev wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clarify the relationship between edge electronic states in open-boundary crystalline systems and their corresponding bulk electronic structure, Alase et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 076804 (2016)] have recently generalized Bloch's theorem to lattice models with broken translational symmetry. Their formalism provides a bulk-boundary correspondence indicator, D, sensitive directly to the localization of edge states. We extend this formalism in two significant ways. First, we explicitly classify the edge-state basis provided by the theory according to their underlying protecting symmetries. Second, acknowledging that the true topological invariant is the Zak phase, inherently defined only for periodic boundary conditions, we introduce an analogous quantity $\gamma_Z$, suitable for open-boundary systems. We illustrate these developments on the example of the Kitaev wire model. We demonstrate that both indicators, $D$ and our open-boundary analog, $\gamma_Z$, effectively capture topological localization: while D diverges within the topological phase, $\gamma_Z = \pi$ . We further examine eigenvalues ($z$) of the lattice shift operator, showing that variations in these eigenvalues as a function of chemical potential provide additional signatures of topological phase transitions. Additionally, we study a periodic Kitaev wire containing a bond impurity, revealing that while the topological phase remains characterized by $\gamma_Z = \pi$, significant state localization near the impurity emerges only at critical values of the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>REBCO delamination by transverse electromagnetic stress due to screening current in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REBCO coated conductor has great potential to be used in ultra-high field magnets. Commercial REBCO tapes are strong in the longitudinal direction but prone to delamination by tensile stress in the thickness direction. For high field magnet applications, it is crucial to characterize delamination strength of REBCO conductor and better manage the transverse electromagnetic stress. In this work, the electromagnetic stress in high magnetic fields by screen current is used to study the delamination behavior of commercial REBCO tapes. Screening currents are induced in REBCO by either ramping field or rotating sample in magnetic fields up to 35 T. The experimental results are presented. The prospect of using this method for quality assurance in large magnet projects is discussed.</description>

      <title>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a d-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same FFLO phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding 45% without applied magnetic fields. The d-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free setting. The supercurrent-controlled finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO state modulates both the topological gap and the diode response. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Strong correlation behavior and Strong coupling superconductivity in (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix with the rich magnetic element Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for new superconductors, especially unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades but remains one of the major outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics. Medium/high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) are new fertile soils of unconventional superconductors and generate widespread interest and questions on the existence of superconductivity in highly disordered materials. Here, we report on the effect of Ni-doped on the crystal structure and superconductivity properties of strongly coupled TiHfNbTa MEA. XRD results indicate that the maximum solid solution of (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix is about 7.7%. Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements demonstrated that (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEAs are all bulk type-II superconductors and follow the trend of the increase of Tc with the increase of Ni-doped contents. The specific heat jump of all (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix are much larger than the BCS value of 1.43, suggesting all these HEAs are strongly coupled superconductors. Additionally, large Kadawaki-Woods ratio values suggest that there is a strong electron correlation effect in this system. The (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEA system is a new ideal material platform for the study of strong correlation behavior and strongly coupled superconductivity, which provides an insight into the physics of high-temperature superconductors or other unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Weak Localization Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dirty two-dimensional superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields described by the nonlinear sigma model that includes short-range electron-electron interactions from the Coulomb and Cooper channels. The renormalized Ginzburg-Landau theory, which includes the weak localization effects at the one-loop level, is constructed by using the Keldysh functional formalism. It is shown that the tricritical point appears in the phase diagram. The superconducting diode quality factor increases divergently as the system approaches the tricritical point. Near the superconducting phase transition lines, the absolute value of the diode quality factor decreases due to the cooperation of localization and interactions. The normal conductivity of the resistive state, in which the superconducting state is destroyed by the critical current, is calculated, and localization behaviors are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Charge-Transfer Complex $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ Analogous to Organic Spin Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST: bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN), which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that $\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa, $\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN. Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective charge transfer drives two-step negative thermal expansion structural transitions in PbTa2Se4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect has been found generally combined with structural phase transitions. However, the charge and orbital freedoms of the NTE has not been well studied. This study employs angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to elucidate the charge and orbital kinetics of the anomalous two-step negative thermal expansion structural phase transitions in PbTa2Se4. As the temperature decreases, each transition undergoes a similar block-layer sliding, although the charge transfer behaviors differ significantly. During the first transition, charge is mainly transferred from the Pb 6pz orbital to an M-shaped band below the Fermi level, barely altering the Fermi surface. In contrast, the second transition involves modifications to both the Fermi surface and charge-transfer orbitals, with charge selectively transferred from Pb 6px/py orbitals to Ta 5dz2 orbitals and a decrease of the Fermi pockets formed by Pb 6px/py orbitals. Furthermore, a small pressure can easily tune the base structure phase among the three phases and the corresponding superconductivity. Therefore, our findings reveal that the orbital-selective charge transfer drives the unusual structure transition in PbTa2Se4, offering new insights into the NTE mechanisms and providing a unique window to study the pressure-tuned superconductivity in this metal-intercalated transition chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Borromean Super-counterfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of dynamical field theories for $N$-component "Borromean" ($N\geq 3$) super-counterfluid order, naturally formulated in terms of inter-species bosonic fields $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$. Their condensation breaks the normal-state [U(1)]$^N$ symmetry down to its diagonal U(1) subgroup, thereby encoding the arrest of the net superflow. This approach broadens our understanding of dynamical properties of super-counterfluids, at low energies capturing its universal properties, phase transition, counterflow vortices, and many of its other properties. Such super-counterfluid strikingly exhibits $N$ distinct flavors of energetically stable elementary vortex solutions, despite $\mathbb{Z}^{N-1}$ homotopy group of its $N\! -\! 1$ independent Goldstone modes, with $N\! -\! 1$ topologically distinct elementary vortex types, obeying modular arithmetic. The model leads to Borromean hydrodynamics as a low-energy theory, reveals counteflow AC Josephson effect, and generically predicts a first-order character of the phase transitions into Borromean super-counterfluid state in dimensions greater than two.</description>

      <title>Direct signatures of $d$-level hybridization and dimerization in magnetic adatom chains on a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adatom chains on superconductors provide a platform to explore correlated spin states and emergent quantum phases. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study the distance-dependent interaction between Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$. While single atoms exhibit four Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and partially occupied $d$ levels consistent with a $S=2$ spin state, the spin is quenched when two Fe atoms reside in nearest neighbor lattice sites, where the $d$ levels of the atoms hybridize. The non-magnetic dimer configuration is stable in that dimerization persists in chains with weak interactions among the dimers. Thus, the spin-state quenching has important implications also for Fe chains. While even-numbered chains are stable and non-magnetic, odd-numbered chains host a single magnetic atom at one of the chain's ends, with its position being switchable by voltage pulses. Our findings emphasize the role of interatomic coupling in shaping quantum ground states and suggest that engineering alternating hopping amplitudes analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model may offer a pathway to realizing topological systems.</description>

      <title>Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal, or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced $f$-electron orbital weighting in UTe2 mapped by quantum interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase landscape of UTe$_2$ features a remarkable diversity of superconducting phases under applied pressure and magnetic field. Recent quantum oscillation studies at ambient pressure have revealed the quasi-2D Fermi surface of this material. However, the pressure-dependence of the Fermi surface remains an open question. Here we track the evolution of the UTe$_2$ Fermi surface as a function of pressure up to 19.5 kbar by measuring quantum interference oscillations. We find that in sufficient magnetic field to suppress both superconductivity at low pressures and incommensurate antiferromagnetism at higher pressures, the quasi-2D Fermi surface found at ambient pressure smoothly connects to that at 19.5 kbar, with no signs of a reconstruction over this pressure interval. We observe a smooth increase in oscillatory frequency with increasing pressure, indicating that the warping of the cylindrical Fermi sheets continuously increases with pressure. By computing a tight-binding model, we show that this enhanced warping indicates increased $f$-orbital contribution at the Fermi level - up to and beyond the critical pressure at which superconductivity is truncated. These findings highlight the value of high-pressure quantum interference measurements as a new probe of the electronic structure in heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Microwave resonator for measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking at cryogenic temperatures</title>

Abstract: We present a microwave-frequency method for measuring polar Kerr effect and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in unconventional superconductors. While this experiment is motivated by work performed in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, the microwave implementation is quite different, and is based on the doubly degenerate modes of a TE$_{111}$ cavity resonator, which act as polarization states analogous to those of light. The resonator system has $in$-$situ$ actuators that allow quadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as these compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The most reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the two-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case the presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward and reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of reciprocity. We illustrate and characterize a coupler system that generates and detects circularly polarized microwaves, and then show how these are integrated with the TE$_{111}$ resonator, resulting in a dilution refrigerator implementation with a base temperature of 20 mK. We show test data on yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) ferrite and the van der Waals ferromagnet CrGeTe$_3$ as an illustration of how the system operates, then present data showing system performance under realistic conditions at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.</description>

      <title>Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.</description>
