      <title>A note on P\'olya urns: the winner may lead all the time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a P\'olya urn where a drawn ball of colour $i$ is replaced together with a fixed number $m_i$ of balls of the same colour. We give a simple proof that if, for example, there are two colours and the urn starts with more balls of colour 1 than 2, and $m_1\ge m_2$, then there is a positive probability that there always will be more balls of colour 1 than colour 2.</description>

      <title>Coarse graining of stochastic differential equations: averaging and projection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coarse-graining methods for stochastic differential equations. In particular we consider averaging and a type of projection operator method, sometimes referred to as effective dynamic via conditional expectations. The projection method (PM) we consider is related to the ``mimicking marginals'' coarse graining approach proposed by Gy\"ongy. The first contribution of this paper is to provide further theoretical background for the PM and a rigorous link to the Gy\"ongy method. Moreover, we compare PM and averaging. While averaging applies to systems with time scale separation, the PM can in principle be applied irrespective of this. However it is often assumed that the two methods coincide in presence of scale separation. The second contribution of this paper is to make this statement precise, provide sufficient conditions under which these two methods coincide and then show -- via examples and counterexamples -- that this needs not be the case.</description>

      <title>2BSDE with uncertain horizon and application to stochastic control in erratic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and uniqueness of non-Markovian second-order backward stochastic differential equations with an uncertain terminal horizon and establish comparison principles under the assumption that the driver is Lipschitz continuous. The terminal time is both random and exogenous, and it may not be adapted to the Brownian filtration, leading to a singular jump in the 2BSDE decomposition. We also provide a connection between this new class of 2BSDE and a fully nonlinear PDE in a Markovian setting. Our theoretical results are applied to non-Markovian stochastic control problems in two settings: (1) when an agent seeks to maximize utility from a payoff received at an uncertain terminal time by controlling both the drift and volatility of a diffusion process; and (2) when the agent contends with volatility uncertainty stemming from an external source, referred to as Nature, and optimizes the drift in a worst-case scenario for the ambiguous volatility. We term this class of problems erratic stochastic control, reflecting the dual uncertainty in both model parameters and the timing of the terminal horizon.</description>

      <title>Percolation in the marked stationary Random Connection Model for higher-dimensional simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel percolation model that generalizes the classical Random Connection Model (RCM) to a random simplicial complex, allowing for a more refined understanding of connectivity and emergence of large-scale structures in random topological spaces. Regarding percolation with respect to the notion of up-connectivity, we establish the existence of a sharp phase transition for the appearance of a giant component, akin to the well-known threshold behavior in random graphs. This sharp phase transition is, in its generality, new even for the classical RCM as a random graph. As special cases, we obtain sharp phase transitions for the Vietoris-Rips complex, the Cech complex, and the Boolean model, allowing us to identify which properties of these well-known percolation models are actually required.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Integration on Stochastic Sets of Interval Type and Applications to Mathematical Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the existing works, stochastic sets $\mathbb{B}$ of interval type, along with $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic processes, were introduced within the framework of stochastic analysis. In this paper, we undertake the construction of $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic integration by exploring three novel types of $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic integrals: Stieltjes integrals of $\mathbb{B}$-predictable processes with respect to $\mathbb{B}$-adapted processes with finite variation, stochastic integrals of $\mathbb{B}$-predictable processes with respect to $\mathbb{B}$-inner local martingales, and stochastic integrals of $\mathbb{B}$-predictable processes with respect to $\mathbb{B}$-inner semimartingales. These $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic integrals are exclusively defined on subsets $\mathbb{B}$, with values outside the scope of $\mathbb{B}$ being deemed irrelevant. Additionally, we present several notable consequences, including the relationship between $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic integrals and existing stochastic integrals, as well as It\^{o}'s formula for $\mathbb{B}$-inner semimartingales. In the context of models pertaining to uncertain time-horizons in mathematical finance, we establish essentials of mathematical finance for general markets characterized by sudden-stop horizons. This is achieved by defining self-financing strategies, admissible strategies, and no-arbitrary conditions. In such financial markets, the exclusivity characteristic inherent in $\mathbb{B}$-stochastic integrals offers investors a viable alternative approach. This approach enables them to effectively filter out unnecessary information pertaining to asset price dynamics and portfolio strategies that extend beyond the predefined time-horizons.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of First Passage Times of Branching Random Walks in $\mathbb{R}^d$: Asymptotics and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviation probabilities of first passage times (FPT) of discrete-time supercritical non-lattice branching random walks (BRWs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $d\geq 1$. Here, the FPT refers to the first time the BRW enters a ball of radius one with a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon survival. We then apply the spine decomposition technique to construct an asymptotically optimal polynomial-time algorithm for computing the lower large deviation probabilities of the FPT. Our algorithm is also verified numerically. Our analysis provides a further understanding of the microstructural feature that can help characterize the strength of polymers.</description>

      <title>Conditional central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) conditioning on the number of edges. In subcritical region of model parameters, we prove a conditional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) with explicit mean and variance for the number of two stars. This generalizes the corresponding result in the literature for the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph. To prove our main result, we develop a new conditional CLT via exchangeable pairs based on the ideas of Dey and Terlov. Our key technical contributions in the application to ERGMs include establishing a linearity condition for an exchangeable pair involving two star counts, a local CLT for edge counts, as well as new higher-order concentration inequalities. Our approach also works for general subgraph counts, and we give a conjectured form of their conditional CLT.</description>

      <title>Superpositions for General Conditional Mckean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the connection between a general class of Conditional Mckean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (CMVSDEs) and its corresponding (infinite dimensional) Conditional Fokker-Planck Equation. The CMVSDE under consideration is similar to the one studied in [4], which is a non-trivial generalization of the McKean-Vlasov SDE with common noise and is closely related to a new type of non-linear Zakai equation that has not been studied in the literature. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the superposition principles among the three subjects so that their well-posedness can imply each other. More precisely, we shall first prove the superposition principle between the non-linear Zakai equation, a non-linear measure-valued stochastic PDE, and a CMVSDE; and then prove the superposition principle between an infinite dimensional conditional Fokker-Planck equation and the nonlinear Zakai equations. It is worth noting that none of the (weak) well-posedness of these SDEs/SPDEs in such generality have been investigated in the literature.</description>

      <title>Uniform large deviation principles and averaging principles for stochastic Burgers type equations with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns about stochastic Burgers type equations with reflection. First of all, by means of the equicontinuous uniform Laplace principle, we prove the Freidlin-Wentzell uniform large deviation principle for these equations uniformly on bounded sets. Then based on this result, we establish the Dembo-Zeitouni uniform large deviation principle for these equations uniformly on compact sets. Finally, an averaging principle result for these equations is obtained through the time discretization approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete Bak-Sneppen model introduced by Barbay and Kenyon (2001) "On the discrete Bak-Sneppen model of self-organized criticality". We extend their results as well as the non-triviality result of Meester and Znamenskiy (2002) for a finite segment of $\mathbb{Z}^1$ with the periodic boundary condition to a large class of graphs, by using coupling between the Bak-Sneppen model and the oriented percolation in a quadrant. This allows us to avoid dealing with the so-called avalanches, thus simplifying many arguments.</description>

      <title>On Mixed-Precision Iterative Methods and Analysis for Nearly Completely Decomposable Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06378v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of computing the stationary distribution of nearly completely decomposable Markov processes, a well-established area in the classical theory of Markov processes with broad applications in the design, modeling, analysis and optimization of computer systems and applications. We devise a general mathematical framework of numerical solution methods that exploits forms of mixed-precision computation to significantly reduce computation times and that exploits forms of iterative approximate computing approaches to mitigate the impact of inaccurate computations, further reduce computation times, and ensure convergence. Then we derive a mathematical analysis that establishes theoretical properties of our general algorithmic framework including results on approximation errors, convergence behaviors, and other algorithmic characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our general algorithmic framework provides significant improvements in computation times over the most-efficient existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Faster Computation of Entropic Optimal Transport via Stable Low Frequency Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an accelerated version for the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is the reference method for computing the solution to Entropic Optimal Transport.
  Its main draw-back is the exponential slow-down of convergence as the regularization weakens $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.
  Thanks to spectral insights on the behavior of the Hessian, we propose to mitigate the problem via an original spectral warm-start strategy. This leads to faster convergence compared to the reference method, as also demonstrated in our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical evolution of randomness Part B: Geometrisation and the origin of convergence in LLN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical probability theory, the convergence of empirical frequencies to theoretical probabilities: as captured by the Law of Large Numbers (LLN): is treated as axiomatic and emergent from statistical assumptions such as independence and identical distribution. In this work, a novel dynamical framework is constructed in which convergence arises as a consequence of structured evolution in outcome space, rather than a statistical postulate. Through this formalism, statistical convergence is derived dynamically, revealing an internal structure to randomness and exposing entanglement between successive trials. The system recovers classical LLN behaviour in the large-number limit, while predicting deviations, transient fluctuations, and geometric asymmetries in the early regime. This work inaugurates a new paradigm: dynamical probability mechanics: in which randomness is modelled not as a sequence of disconnected stochastic events, but as a physically structured, feedback-driven process. The theory provides a novel explanatory layer beneath statistical laws and opens pathways toward a mechanistic foundation of probability itself.</description>

      <title>The superposition principle for the continuity equation with singular flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation results for absolutely continuous curves $\mu:[0,T]\to \mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p&gt;1$, with values in the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d),W_p)$ of Borel probability measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite $p$-moment, provide a crucial tool to study evolutionary PDEs in a measure-theoretic setting. They are strictly related to the superposition principle for measure-valued solutions to the continuity equation. This paper addresses the extension of these results to the case $p=1$, and to curves $\mu:[0,+\infty)\to\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that are only of bounded variation in time: in the corresponding continuity equation, the flux measure $\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{loc}([0,+\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^{d};\mathbb{R}^{d})$ thus possesses a non-trivial singular part w.r.t. $\mu$ in addition to the absolutely continuous part featuring the velocity field. Firstly, we carefully address the relation between curves in ${\rm BV}_{loc}([0,+\infty);\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^d))$ and solutions to the associated continuity equation, among which we select those with minimal singular (contribution to the) flux $\nu$. We show that, with those distinguished solutions it is possible to associate an `auxiliary' continuity equation, in an augmented phase space, solely driven by its velocity field. For that continuity equation, a standard version of the superposition principle can be thus obtained. In this way, we derive a first probabilistic representation of the pair $(\mu,\nu)$ solutions by projection over the time and space marginals. This representation involves Lipschitz trajectories in the augmented phase space, reparametrized in time and solving the characteristic system of ODEs. Finally, for the same pair $(\mu,\nu)$ we also prove a superposition principle in terms of BV curves on the actual time interval, providing a fine description of their behaviour at jump points.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Diagram of the REM under independent spin-flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape of the Random Energy model (REM) integrated along trajectories of the simple random walk on the hypercube. We show that the quenched cumulant generating function of the time integral of the REM energy undergoes phase transitions in the large $N$ limit for trajectories of any time extent, and identify phases distinguished by the activity and value of the time integral. This is achieved by relating the dynamical behavior to the spectral properties of Hamiltonians associated with the Quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). Of independent interest are deterministic $ \ell^p $-properties of the resolvents of such Hamiltonians, which we establish.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ factorization does not hold for arbitrary multi-trace observables in random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider real tensors of order $D$, that is $D$-dimensional arrays of real numbers $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$, where each index $a^c$ can take $N$ values. The tensor entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ have no symmetry properties under permutations of the indices. The invariant polynomials built out of the tensor entries are called trace invariants.
  We prove that for a Gaussian random tensor with $D\ge 3$ indices (that is such that the entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ are independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables) the cumulant, or connected expectation, of a product of trace invariants is not always suppressed in scaling in $N$ with respect to the product of the expectations of the individual invariants. Said otherwise, not all the multi-trace expectations factor at large $N$ in terms of the single-trace ones and the Gaussian scaling is not subadditive on the connected components. This is in stark contrast to the $D=2$ case of random matrices in which the multi-trace expectations always factor at large $N$. The best one can do for $D\ge 3$ is to identify restricted families of invariants for which the large $N$ factorization holds and we check that this indeed happens when restricting to the family of melonic observables, the dominant family in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>Pathwise convergence of a novel numerical scheme based on semi-implicit method for stochastic differential-algebraic equations with non-global Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the well-posedness and the numerical approximation of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear local Lipschitz coefficients that satisfy the more general monotonicity condition called Khasminskii condition. The key challenge is the presence of a singular matrix which makes the numerical integration hard and heavy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on semi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs. More precisely we split the drift term as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term. The linear part is approximated implicitly, while the nonlinear part is approximated explicitly. The linear component's role is to handle the singularity issues during the numerical integration without the resolution of nonlinear algebraic equations in the constraint equations. This novel scheme is therefore very efficient for SDAEs in high dimension that come after the spatial discretisation of stochastic partial differential algebraic equations (SPDAEs). To prove the pathwise convergence of our novel scheme, we first derive a equivalent scheme called dual scheme, suitable for mathematical analysis and linked to the inherent stochastic differential equation resulting from the elimination of constraints in the initial SDAEs. We prove that our novel scheme converges to the exact solution with rate $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$, for arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$ in the pathwise sense. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in high dimension and to show that our theoretical results are in agreement with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous stochastic games with heterogeneous mean field interactions and jumps on large networks and explore their limit counterparts. We introduce the graphon game model based on a controlled graphon mean field stochastic differential equation system with jumps, which can be regarded as the limiting case of a finite game dynamic system as the number of players goes to infinity. We examine the case of controlled dynamics, with control terms present in the drift, diffusion, and jump components. We focus on the study of Markovian controls and concentrate on the limit theory. We provide convergence results on the state trajectories and their laws, transitioning from finite game systems to graphon systems. We also study approximate equilibria for finite games on large networks, using the graphon equilibrium as a benchmark. The rates of convergence are analyzed under various underlying graphon models and regularity assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We study properties of the (generalized) Dickman distribution with two parameters and the stationary solution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation driven by a Poisson process. In particular, we show that the marginal distribution of this solution is the Dickman distribution. Additionally, we investigate superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes which may have short- or long-range dependencies and marginal distribution of the form of the Dickman distribution. The numerical algorithm for simulation of these processes is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop two novel couplings between general pure-jump L\'evy processes in $\R^d$ and apply them to obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence in an appropriate Wasserstein distance on the path space for a wide class of L\'evy processes attracted to a multidimensional stable process in the small-time regime. We also establish general lower bounds based on certain universal properties of slowly varying functions and the relationship between the Wasserstein and Toscani--Fourier distances of the marginals. Our upper and lower bounds typically have matching rates. In particular, the rate of convergence is polynomial for the domain of normal attraction and slower than a slowly varying function for the domain of non-normal attraction.</description>

      <title>Voter model on heterogeneous directed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consensus dynamics of the voter model on large random graphs with heterogeneous and directed features, focusing in particular on networks with power-law degree distributions. By extending recent results on sparse directed graphs, we derive exact first-order asymptotics for the expected consensus time in directed configuration models with i.i.d. Pareto-distributed in- and out-degrees. For any tail exponent {\alpha}&gt;0, we derive the mean consensus time scaling depending on the network size and a pre-factor that encodes detailed structural properties of the degree sequences. We give an explicit description of the pre factor in the directed setting. This extends and sharpens previous mean-field predictions from statistical physics, providing the first explicit consensus-time formula in the directed heavy-tailed setting. Through extensive simulations, we confirm the validity of our predictions across a wide range of heterogeneity regimes, including networks with infinite variance and infinite mean degree distribution. We further explore the interplay between network topology and voter dynamics, highlighting how degree fluctuations and maximal degrees shape the consensus landscape. Complementing the asymptotic analysis, we provide numerical evidence for the emergence of Wright-Fisher diffusive behavior in both directed and undirected ensembles under suitable mixing conditions, and demonstrate the breakdown of this approximation in the in the infinite mean regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we explore the mathematical preliminaries and foundational concepts that connect stochastic processes with partial differential equations. We begin by investigating Brownian motion, which serves as a model for random fluctuations and is deeply connected to the heat equation. This connection forms the basis for understanding diffusion phenomena, where the probability distribution of Brownian motion evolves according to the heat equation over time. To extend this classical result to more general stochastic systems, we introduce the It\^o calculus, a powerful framework that allows us to analyze processes driven by both deterministic drift and stochastic fluctuations. This mathematical tool is essential for understanding the dynamics of more complex diffusion processes, where randomness is no longer purely Brownian, but also depends on the underlying system's state. Building on these concepts, we turn to the study of diffusion processes, which generalize Brownian motion by incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation. This equation describes how the probability density of a diffusion process evolves over time and serves as an extension of the heat equation to more complex stochastic systems. By using It\^o calculus, we can rigorously study how these processes behave and connect the microscopic randomness of individual particles to their macroscopic description via partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Normal approximations for the multivariate inverse Gaussian distribution and asymmetric kernel smoothing on $d$-dimensional half-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04757v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel density estimator supported on $d$-dimensional half-spaces. It stands out as the first asymmetric kernel density estimator for half-spaces in the literature. Using the multivariate inverse Gaussian (MIG) density from Minami (2003) as the kernel and incorporating locally adaptive parameters, the estimator achieves desirable boundary properties. To analyze its mean integrated squared error (MISE) and asymptotic normality, a local limit theorem and probability metric bounds are established between the MIG and the corresponding multivariate Gaussian distribution with the same mean vector and covariance matrix, which may also be of independent interest. Additionally, a new algorithm for generating MIG random vectors is developed, proving to be faster and more accurate than Minami's algorithm based on a Brownian first-hitting location representation. This algorithm is then used to discuss and compare optimal MISE and likelihood cross-validation bandwidths for the estimator in a simulation study under various target distributions. As an application, the MIG asymmetric kernel is used to smooth the posterior distribution of a generalized Pareto model fitted to large electromagnetic storms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with $N$ samples can be linked to the $N$-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the $N$-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in $N$. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of the objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size $N$ tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising in biomathematics, consisting of a chemotaxis model with a cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by using the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators, and cut-off functions. This scheme enables the construction of sufficiently smooth approximate solutions and facilitates the effective application of the entropy-energy method. Then, based on a newly derived stochastic version of the entropy-energy inequality, we further establish some a priori higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method, allow us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein barycenter problem in the setting of non-compact, non-smooth extended metric measure spaces. We introduce a couple of new concepts and obtain the existence, uniqueness, absolute continuity of the Wasserstein barycenter, and prove Jensen's inequality in an abstract framework.
  This generalized several results on Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces, to metric measure spaces satisfying Riemannian Curvature-Dimension condition \`a la Lott--Sturm--Villani, and some extended metric measure spaces including abstract Wiener spaces and configuration spaces over Riemannian manifolds.
  We also introduce a new curvature-dimesion condition, we call Barycenter-Curvature-Dimension condition. We prove its stability under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and prove the existence of the Wasserstein barycenter under this new condition. In addition, we get some geometric inequalities including a multi-marginal Brunn--Minkowski inequality and a functional Blaschke--Santal\'o type inequality.</description>

Our result can be extended to more general functions that include orthogonal projections and fractional Brownian motion. As a particular case, letting $\theta=1$, the results are valid for the Box dimension.</description>

      <title>Beyond Propagation of Chaos: A Stochastic Algorithm for Mean Field Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.</description>

      <title>High order integration of stochastic dynamics on Riemannian manifolds with frozen flow methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations with additive noise on general Riemannian manifolds with high weak order of accuracy. In opposition to the popular approach with projection methods, the proposed methods are intrinsic: they only rely on geometric operations and avoid coordinates and embeddings. We provide a robust and general convergence analysis and an algebraic formalism of exotic planar Butcher series for the computation of order conditions at any high order. To illustrate the methodology, an explicit method of second weak order is introduced, and several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and extend the approach for the sampling of the invariant measure of Riemannian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unimodality of the number of paths per length on polytopes: Examples, counter-examples, and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve a linear program, the simplex method follows a path in the graph of a polytope, on which a linear function increases. The length of this path is an key measure of the complexity of the simplex method. Numerous previous articles focused on the longest paths, or, following Borgwardt, computed the average length of a path for certain random polytopes. We detail more precisely how this length is distributed, i.e., how many paths of each length there are.
  It was conjectured by De Loera that the number of paths counted according to their length forms a unimodal sequence. We give examples (old and new) for which this holds; but we disprove this conjecture by constructing counterexamples for several classes of polytopes. However, De Loera is "statistically correct": We prove that the length of coherent paths on a random polytope (with vertices chosen uniformly on a sphere) admits a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Clustering in Mixture of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic portfolio theory with price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for stochastic portfolio theory (SPT), which incorporates modern nonlinear price impact and impact decay models. Our main result derives the celebrated master formula for additive functional generation of trading strategies in a general high-dimensional market model with price impact. We also develop formulas for an investor's relative wealth with respect to the market portfolio, conditions that guarantee positive observed market prices and derive a stochastic differential equation governing the dynamics of the observed price, investor's holdings and price impact processes. As an application of these results, we develop conditions for relative arbitrage in the price impact setting analogous to previously obtained results for the frictionless setting. Numerical experiments are presented to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Mitigating collusion in Gold Humanism Honor Society nominations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An anecdotally common complaint regarding induction into the Gold Humanism Honor Society is the bias toward close friends during the initial nomination process. In this work, we numerically simulate the nomination process under different assumptions, demonstrate that collusion can be detected, and propose a simple strategy to correct for bias in the nomination process.</description>
