      <title>Swallow-tail dispersions of moving solitons in a two-dimensional fermionic superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton-like localised wave solutions in a two-dimensional Fermi superfluid are studied by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in the BCS regime of weak pairing interactions. The dispersion relations of these solitons are found to exhibit a peculiar swallow-tail shape, with cusps and multiple branches. The effective mass of the solitons is found to diverge and change sign at the cusp. This behavior is in contrast to the smooth dispersion relations and negative effective masses of solitons in the three-dimensional Fermi superfluid. The swallow-tail dispersion relations are shown to be a consequence of counterflow of the superfluid and sign-changing contributions to the superfluid current from different transverse momenta in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The results are relevant for the understanding of solitonic excitations in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids, such as ultracold atomic gases and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Landau damping and algebraic thermalization in two-dimensional superfluids far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative description of the thermalization dynamics of far-from-equilibrium, two-dimensional (2D) Bose superfluids. Our analysis leverages a quantum kinetic formalism and allows us to identify two successive regimes of relaxation: an initial damping of quasi-particles due to Landau scattering processes, followed by the slower establishment of a global equilibrium at long time. For a far-from-equilibrium initial state, we find that Landau damping differs from the conventional picture of exponentially relaxing quasi-particles. Moreover, our results showcase a pronounced mechanism of algebraic transport at late times, rooted in energy conservation and compatible with 2D diffusion. Using theoretical and numerical arguments, we construct a detailed dynamical portrait of global equilibration in 2D superfluids.</description>

      <title>Tweezer interferometry with NOON states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic interferometers measure phase differences along paths with exceptional precision. Tweezer interferometry is a novel approach for performing this task. It allows to guide the particles along pre-defined trajectories. We explore the feasibility of using condensed bosons in tweezer interferometry. As opposed to factor $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement with ${N \sim 100}$ fermions, here we expect factor ${N}$ enhancement using NOON state interferometry. The proposed protocol involves adiabatic splitting and merging, followed by adiabatic branching of condensed bosons. The purpose of the latter step is phase encoding. Spontaneous symmetry breaking should be avoided. We estimate the time that is required for performing those sweep processes.</description>

      <title>Mechanism for sound dissipation in a two-dimensional degenerate Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the transport properties of a two-dimensional Fermi gas in a weakly and strongly interacting regimes, in the range of temperatures close to the transition to a superfluid phase. For that we excite sound waves in a fermionic mixture by using the phase imprinting technique, follow their evolution, and finally determine both their speed and attenuation. Our formalism incorporates thermal fluctuations via the ground canonical ensemble description and with the help of Metropolis algoritm. From numerical simulations we extract temperature dependence of the sound velocity and diffusivity as well as the dependence on the interaction strength. We emphasize the role of virtual vortex-antivortex pairs creation in the process of sound dissipation.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an ultracold Fermi gas against Fermi acceleration to superdiffusion through localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e., destructive quantum interference of multiple-scattering paths, halts transport entirely. Contrarily, time-dependent random forces expedite transport via Fermi acceleration, proposed as a mechanism for high-energy cosmic rays. Their competition creates interesting dynamics, but experimental observations are scarce. Here, we experimentally study the expansion of an ultracold Fermi gas inside time-dependent disorder and observe distinct regimes from sub- to superdiffusion. Unexpectedly, quantum interference counteracts acceleration in strong disorder. Our system enables the investigation of Fermi acceleration in the quantum-transport regime.</description>
