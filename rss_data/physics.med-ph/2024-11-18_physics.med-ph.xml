      <title>Prediction of cerebral blood volume change after resuscitation from hypoxic-ischemic insult for newborn piglets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality and developmental disabilities. It has been revealed that the temporal behavior of the cerebral blood volume (CBV) carries information on the degree of hypoxia-ischemia. CBV can be estimated by means of near-infrared spectroscopy. The change of CBV after the insult is related to the change of CBV during the insult. In this paper, we consider a mathematical model which governs the time evolution of CBV after the insult. We show that the temporal behavior of CBV can be predicted with the Kalman filter which is based on the mathematical model.</description>

      <title>Two-step registration method boosts sensitivity in longitudinal fixel-based analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal analyses are increasingly used in clinical studies as they allow the study of subtle changes over time within the same subjects. In most of these studies, it is necessary to align all the images studied to a common reference by registering them to a template. In the study of white matter using the recently developed fixel-based analysis (FBA) method, this registration is important, in particular because the fiber bundle cross-section metric is a direct measure of this registration. In the vast majority of longitudinal FBA studies described in the literature, sessions acquired for a same subject are directly independently registered to the template. However, it has been shown in T1-based morphometry that a 2-step registration through an intra-subject average can be advantageous in longitudinal analyses. In this work, we propose an implementation of this 2-step registration method in a typical longitudinal FBA aimed at investigating the evolution of white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared at the fixel level the mean absolute effect and standard deviation yielded by this registration method and by a direct registration, as well as the results obtained with each registration method for the study of AD in both fixelwise and tract-based analyses. We found that the 2-step method reduced the variability of the measurements and thus enhanced statistical power in both types of analyses.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Collimated X-Ray Image Simulation Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collimator detection remains a challenging task in X-ray systems with unreliable or non-available information about the detectors position relative to the source. This paper presents a physically motivated image processing pipeline for simulating the characteristics of collimator shadows in X-ray images. By generating randomized labels for collimator shapes and locations, incorporating scattered radiation simulation, and including Poisson noise, the pipeline enables the expansion of limited datasets for training deep neural networks. We validate the proposed pipeline by a qualitative and quantitative comparison against real collimator shadows. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that utilizing simulated data within our deep learning framework not only serves as a suitable substitute for actual collimators but also enhances the generalization performance when applied to real-world data.</description>

      <title>A Method for Imaging the Ischemic Penumbra with MRI using IVIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the hypothesis that intravoxel incoherent motion MRI (IVIM) can quantify local cerebral blood flow (qCBF), infarct volume, and define the ischemic penumbra for determination of the perfusion-diffusion mismatch (PWI/DWI) volume in a setting of acute ischemic stroke. Eight experiments were conducted in a pre-clinical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. IVIM and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging were acquired 2.5hr post-MCAO. IVIM was post-processed using software written in-house to produce parametric images of local qCBF, Water Transport Time (WTT), diffusion, and subsequently, PWI/DWI mismatch. These IVIM image parameters were compared with delay-and-dispersion-corrected local-AIF DSC perfusion image parameters including Tmax, qCBF, mean transit time (MTT), and mean diffusivity for DSC PWI/DWI mismatch. Final infarct volume was measured 4hrs post-occlusion. Early (2.5hr post-occlusion) DSC qCBF and IVIM qCBF in the diffusion negative MCA territory correlated strongly (slope=1.00, p=0.01,R2=0.69,Lins CCC=0.71), and both DSC and IVIM qCBF values negatively correlated with final infarct volume (R2=0.78,R2=0.61 respectively). The volume of hypoperfusion measured at 2.5 hours from DSC qCBF and from IVIM qCBF both predicted final infarct volume with good sensitivity and correlation (slope=2.08, R2=0.67, slope=2.50,R2=0.68 respectively). IVIM PWI/DWI ratio was correlated with infarct growth (R2=0.70) and WTT correlated with MTT (slope=0.82,R2=0.60). IVIM qCBF correlated strongly with local-AIF DSC qCBF and IVIM PWI/DWI correlated strongly with infarct growth. Both DSC and IVIM quantitative perfusion image acquired early after occlusion were able to predict final infarct volume, and IVIM simultaneous PWI/DWI ratio predicted infarct growth.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Imaging of $^{55}\text{Co}$ and $^{18}\text{F}$-Labeled Tracers in a Single "Multiplexed" PET Imaging Session</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Co-55 as a radioisotope for multiplexed PET (mPET) by utilizing its emission of a prompt gamma-ray in cascade with a positron during decay. We leverage the prompt-gamma signal to generate triple coincidences for a Co-55-labeled tracer, allowing us to distinguish it from a tracer labeled with a pure positron emitter, such as F-18. By employing triple versus double coincidence detection and signal processing methodology, we successfully separate the Co-55 signal from that of F-18. Phantom studies were conducted to establish the correlation between Co-55 double and triple coincidence counts and Co-55 activity. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for quantifying hot spots within a warm background produced by both Co-55 and F-18 signals in a single PET scan. Finally, we showcase the ability to simultaneously image two tracers in vivo in a single PET session with mouse models of cancer.</description>
