      <title>Note on Bubbles Attached to Real Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational bubble is a situation in which the asset price exceeds its fundamental value defined by the present value of dividends in a rational equilibrium model. We discuss the recent development of the theory of rational bubbles attached to real assets, emphasizing the following three points. (i) There exist plausible economic models in which bubbles inevitably emerge in the sense that all equilibria are bubbly. (ii) Such models are necessarily nonstationary but their long-run behavior can be analyzed using the local stable manifold theorem. (iii) Bubbles attached to real assets can naturally and necessarily arise with economic development. Finally, we present a model with stocks and land, and show that bubbles in aggregate stock and land prices necessarily emerge.</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>

      <title>Strategic Irreversible Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies oligopolistic irreversible investment with closed-loop strategies. These permit fully dynamic interactions that result in much richer strategic behavior than previous studies with open-loop strategies allow. The tradeoff between preemption incentives and the option value of waiting becomes distinctly visible. Strategies that depend on present capital stocks enable credible reactions that deter from excessive preemption and support positive option values in equilibrium. Simpler strategies lead into a "preemption trap" with perfectly competitive outcome and zero net present values. To obtain these results, a novel concept of Markov perfect equilibrium is developed that copes with optimal investment taking the form of singular control.</description>
