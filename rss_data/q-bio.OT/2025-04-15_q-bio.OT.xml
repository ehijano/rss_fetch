      <title>Diagnostic Uncertainty Limits the Potential of Early Warning Signals to Identify Epidemic Emergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods to detect the emergence of infectious diseases, and approach to the "critical transition" RE = 1, have to potential to avert substantial disease burden by facilitating preemptive actions like vaccination campaigns. Early warning signals (EWS), summary statistics of infection case time series, show promise in providing such advanced warnings. As EWS are computed on test positive case data, the accuracy of this underlying data is integral to their predictive ability, but will vary with changes in the diagnostic test accuracy and the incidence of the target disease relative to clinically-compatible background noise. We simulated emergent and null time series as the sum of an SEIR-generated measles time series, and background noise generated by either independent draws from a Poisson distribution, or an SEIR simulation with rubella-like parameters. We demonstrate that proactive outbreak detection with EWS metrics is resilient to decreasing diagnostic accuracy, so long as background infections remain proportionally low. Under situations with large, episodic, noise, imperfect diagnostic tests cannot appropriately discriminate between emergent and null periods. Not all EWS metrics performed equally: we find that the mean was the least affected by changes to the noise structure and magnitude, given a moderately accurate diagnostic test (&gt;= to 95% sensitive and specific), and the autocovariance and variance were the most predictive when the noise incidence did not exhibit large temporal variations. In these situations, diagnostic test accuracy should not be a precursor to the implementation of an EWS metric-based alert system.</description>
