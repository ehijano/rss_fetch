      <title>Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps separate the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike the existing methods, our proposed approach eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed methodology to the settings, in which the treatment feature is based on human perception rather than is assumed to be fixed given the treatment object. We conduct simulation studies using the generated text data with an open-source LLM, Llama3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over the state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Glucodensity Functional Profiles Outperform Traditional Continuous Glucose Monitoring Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data has revolutionized the management of type 1 diabetes, particularly when integrated with insulin pumps to mitigate clinical events such as hypoglycemia. Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing CGM devices in clinical studies involving healthy and diabetes populations. However, efficiently exploiting the high temporal resolution of CGM profiles remains a significant challenge. Numerous indices -- such as time-in-range metrics and glucose variability measures -- have been proposed, but evidence suggests these metrics overlook critical aspects of glucose dynamic homeostasis. As an alternative method, this paper explores the clinical value of glucodensity metrics in capturing glucose dynamics -- specifically the speed and acceleration of CGM time series -- as new biomarkers for predicting long-term glucose outcomes. Our results demonstrate significant information gains, exceeding 20\% in terms of adjusted $R^2$, in forecasting glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at five and eight years from baseline AEGIS data, compared to traditional non-CGM and CGM glucose biomarkers. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating more complex CGM functional metrics, such as the glucodensity approach, to fully capture continuous glucose fluctuations across different time-scale resolutions.</description>

      <title>Denoising Variational Autoencoder as a Feature Reduction Pipeline for the diagnosis of Autism based on Resting-state fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by restricted interests and difficulties in communication. The complexity of ASD has resulted in a deficiency of objective diagnostic biomarkers. Deep learning methods have gained recognition for addressing these challenges in neuroimaging analysis, but finding and interpreting such diagnostic biomarkers are still challenging computationally. We propose an ASD feature reduction pipeline using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). We used Ncuts parcellations and Power atlas to extract functional connectivity data, resulting in over 30 thousand features. Then the pipeline further compresses the connectivities into 5 latent Gaussian distributions, providing is a low-dimensional representation of the data, using a denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE). To test the method, we employed the extracted latent features from the DVAE to classify ASD using traditional classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) on a large multi-site dataset. The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of the SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions. Without using DVAE, the prediction accuracy is 0.70, which falls within the interval. This implies that the model successfully encodes the diagnostic information in rs-fMRI data to 5 Gaussian distributions (10 features) without sacrificing prediction performance. The runtime for training the DVAE and obtaining classification results from its extracted latent features (37 minutes) was 7 times shorter compared to training classifiers directly on the raw connectivity matrices (5-6 hours). Our findings also suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Ncuts parcellations. The encoded features can be used for the help of diagnosis and interpretation of the disease.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Classification of Near-Surface Shallow-Water Sediments using A Portable Free-Fall Penetrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geotechnical evaluation of seabed sediments is important for engineering projects and naval applications, offering valuable insights into sediment properties, behavior, and strength. Obtaining high-quality seabed samples can be a challenging task, making in-situ testing an essential part of site characterization. Free Fall Penetrometers (FFP) have emerged as robust tools for rapidly profiling seabed surface sediments, even in energetic nearshore or estuarine conditions and shallow as well as deep depths. While methods for interpretation of traditional offshore Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) data are well-established, their adaptation to FFP data is still an area of research. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that utilizes machine learning algorithms to create a sediment behavior classification system based on portable free fall penetrometer (PFFP) data. The proposed model leverages PFFP measurements obtained from locations such as Sequim Bay (Washington), the Potomac River, and the York River (Virginia). The result shows 91.1\% accuracy in the class prediction, with the classes representing cohesionless sediment with little to no plasticity, cohesionless sediment with some plasticity, cohesive sediment with low plasticity, and cohesive sediment with high plasticity. The model prediction not only provides the predicted class but also yields an estimate of inherent uncertainty associated with the prediction, which can provide valuable insight about different sediment behaviors. These uncertainties typically range from very low to very high, with lower uncertainties being more common, but they can increase significantly dpending on variations in sediment composition, environmental conditions, and operational techniques. By quantifying uncertainty, the model offers a more comprehensive and informed approach to sediment classification.</description>

      <title>Robust Emax Model Fitting: Addressing Nonignorable Missing Binary Outcome in Dose-Response Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Binary Emax model is widely employed in dose-response analysis during drug development, where missing data often pose significant challenges. Addressing nonignorable missing binary responses, where the likelihood of missing data is related to unobserved outcomes, is particularly important, yet existing methods often lead to biased estimates. This issue is compounded when using the regulatory-recommended imputing as treatment failure approach, known as non-responder imputation. Moreover, the problem of separation, where a predictor perfectly distinguishes between outcome classes, can further complicate likelihood maximization. In this paper, we introduce a penalized likelihood-based method that integrates a modified Expectation-Maximization algorithm in the spirit of Ibrahim and Lipsitz to effectively manage both nonignorable missing data and separation issues. Our approach applies a noninformative Jeffreys prior to the likelihood, reducing bias in parameter estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods, such as NRI, and the superiority is further supported by its application to data from a Phase II clinical trial. Additionally, we have developed an R package, ememax, to facilitate the implementation of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fermi-GBM Team Analysis on The Ravasio Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prompt spectra of gamma-ray bursts are known to follow broadband continuum behavior over decades in energy. GRB 221009A, given the moniker the brightest of all time (BOAT), is the brightest gamma-ray burst identified in half a century of observations, and was first identified by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). On behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team, Lesage et al. (2023) described the initial GBM analysis. Ravasio et al. (2024) report the identification of a spectral line in part of the prompt emission of this burst, which they describe as evolving over 80 s from $\sim$12 MeV to 6 MeV. We report a GBM Team analysis on the Ravasio Line: 1) We cannot identify an instrumental effect that could have produced this signal, and 2) our method of calculating the statistical significance of the line shows it easily exceeds the 5$\sigma$ discovery threshold. We additionally comment on the claim of the line beginning at earlier time intervals, up to 37 MeV, as reported in Zhang et al. (2024). We find that it is reasonable to utilize these measurements for characterization of the line evolution, with caution. We encourage theoretical studies exploring this newly discovered gamma-ray burst spectral feature, unless any rigorous alternative explanation unrelated to the emission from GRB 221009A is identified.</description>

Abstract: Social network analysis can answer research questions such as why or how individuals interact or form relationships and how those relationships impact other outcomes. Despite the breadth of methods available to address psychological research questions, social network analysis is not yet a standard practice in psychological research. To promote the use of social network analysis in psychological research, we present an overview of network methods, situating each method within the context of research studies and questions in psychology.</description>

Abstract: Over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the prediction and modelling of competitive sports outcomes, with particular emphasis placed on this area by the Bayesian statistics and machine learning communities. In this paper, we have carried out a comparative evaluation of statistical and machine learning models to assess their predictive performance for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and for the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations by evaluating alternative summaries of past performances related to the involved teams. More specifically, we consider the Bayesian Bradley-Terry-Davidson model, which is a widely used statistical framework for ranking items based on paired comparisons that have been applied successfully in various domains, including football. The analysis was performed including in some canonical goal-based models both the Bradley-Terry-Davidson derived ranking and the widely recognized Coca-Cola FIFA ranking commonly adopted by football fans and amateurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is commonly employed to help estimate the likelihood of extreme events in many geophysical and other application areas. The recently proposed blended generalized extreme value (bGEV) distribution modifies the GEV with positive shape parameter to avoid a hard lower bound that complicates fitting and inference. Here, the bGEV is extended to the GEV with negative shape parameter, avoiding a hard upper bound that is unrealistic in many applications. This extended bGEV is shown to improve on the GEV for forecasting heat and sea level extremes based on past data. Software implementing this bGEV and applying it to the example temperature and sea level data is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation is a core component of numerical weather prediction systems. The large quantity of data processed during assimilation requires the computation to be distributed across increasingly many compute nodes, yet existing approaches suffer from synchronisation overhead in this setting. In this paper, we exploit the formulation of data assimilation as a Bayesian inference problem and apply a message-passing algorithm to solve the spatial inference problem. Since message passing is inherently based on local computations, this approach lends itself to parallel and distributed computation. In combination with a GPU-accelerated implementation, we can scale the algorithm to very large grid sizes while retaining good accuracy and compute and memory requirements.</description>

Abstract: Local spatial models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) serve as instrumental tools to capture intrinsic contextual effects through the estimates of the local intercepts and behavioral contextual effects through estimates of the local slope parameters. GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric causal inference for optogenetics: sequential excursion effects for dynamic regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optogenetics is a powerful neuroscience technique for studying how neural circuit manipulation affects behavior. Standard analysis conventions discard information and severely limit the scope of the causal questions that can be probed. To address this gap, we 1) draw connections to the causal inference literature on sequentially randomized experiments, 2) propose a non-parametric framework for analyzing "open-loop" (static regime) optogenetics behavioral experiments, 3) derive extensions of history-restricted marginal structural models for dynamic treatment regimes with positivity violations for "closed-loop" designs, and 4) propose a taxonomy of identifiable causal effects that encompass a far richer collection of scientific questions compared to standard methods. From another view, our work extends "excursion effect" methods, popularized recently in the mobile health literature, to enable estimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences in the presence of positivity violations. We describe sufficient conditions for identifiability of the proposed causal estimands, and provide asymptotic statistical guarantees for a proposed inverse probability-weighted estimator, a multiply-robust estimator (for two intervention timepoints), a framework for hypothesis testing, and a computationally scalable implementation. Finally, we apply our framework to data from a recent neuroscience study and show how it provides insight into causal effects of optogenetics on behavior that are obscured by standard analyses.</description>

      <title>More Skin, More Likes! Measuring Child Exposure and User Engagement on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharenting, the practice of parents sharing content about their children on social media platforms, has become increasingly common, raising concerns about children's privacy and safety online. This study investigates children's exposure on TikTok, offering a detailed examination of the platform's content and associated comments. Analyzing 432,178 comments across 5,896 videos from 115 user accounts featuring children, we categorize content into Family, Fashion, and Sports. Our analysis highlights potential risks, such as inappropriate comments or contact offers, with a focus on appearance-based comments. Notably, 21% of comments relate to visual appearance. Additionally, 19.57% of videos depict children in revealing clothing, such as swimwear or bare midriffs, attracting significantly more appearance-based comments and likes than videos featuring fully clothed children, although this trend does not extend to downloads. These findings underscore the need for heightened awareness and protective measures to safeguard children's privacy and well-being in the digital age.</description>
