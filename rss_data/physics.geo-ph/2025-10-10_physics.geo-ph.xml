      <title>Single and Multi-Objective Optimization of Distributed Acoustic Sensing Cable Layouts for Geophysical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic approach to optimise distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fibre-optic cable layouts using global optimisation techniques. Our method represents cable geometries using splines, enabling efficient exploration of layouts while respecting physical deployment constraints. The use of evolutionary algorithms enables single and multi-objective optimisation, taking into account complex design constraints such as terrain, accesibility, exclusion zones and cable length, while allowing efficient parallelisation of the optimisation process. We demonstrate the approach on a real-world case study, optimising the layout of a DAS cable for monitoring slope stability in the Cuolm da Vi area of Switzerland. We adapt design criteria for seismic source location problems, and for ambient noise surface wave tomography, to account for the unique characteristics of DAS, such as directional sensitivity patterns. The results show significant potential for improvements in source location accuracy and surface wave tomographic resolution by optimising cable layouts, highlighting the potential of this approach for optimising DAS deployments in various geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>A Geomechanically-Informed Framework for Wellbore Trajectory Prediction: Integrating First-Principles Kinematics with a Rigorous Derivation of Gated Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate wellbore trajectory prediction is a paramount challenge in subsurface engineering, governed by complex interactions between the drilling assembly and heterogeneous geological formations. This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Probabilistic Modeling for Hourly Streamflow Prediction and Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hourly predictions are critical for issuing flood warnings as the flood peaks on the hourly scale can be distinctly higher than the corresponding daily ones. Currently a popular hourly data-driven prediction scheme is multi-time-scale long short-term memory (MTS-LSTM), yet such models face challenges in probabilistic forecasts or integrating observations when available. Diffusion artificial intelligence (AI) models represent a promising method to predict high-resolution information, e.g., hourly streamflow. Here we develop a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (h-Diffusion) for hourly streamflow prediction that conditions on either observed or simulated daily discharge from hydrologic models to generate hourly hydrographs. The model is benchmarked on the CAMELS hourly dataset against record-holding MTS-LSTM and multi-frequency LSTM (MF-LSTM) baselines. Results show that h-Diffusion outperforms baselines in terms of general performance and extreme metrics. Furthermore, the h-Diffusion model can utilize the inpainting technique and recent observations to accomplish data assimilation that largely improves flood forecasting performance. These advances can greatly reduce flood forecasting uncertainty and provide a unified probabilistic framework for downscaling, prediction, and data assimilation at the hourly scale, representing risks where daily models cannot.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Mars Terraforming, 2025 Workshop Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terraforming Mars is an age old science fiction concept now worth revisiting through the lens of modern science and technology. This document serves as a summary of contemporary ideas about Mars terraforming, prepared for attendees of the 2025 Green Mars Workshop. It presents one illustrative story of how Mars might be transformed into a habitable world. The story is told in reverse, beginning with possible planetary endpoints and tracing backward to the steps required to reach them. Along the way, it highlights alternative approaches, critical unknowns and research priorities, and the near term applications and benefits of terraforming research for planetary science, climate engineering, and sustainable technologies on Earth.</description>
