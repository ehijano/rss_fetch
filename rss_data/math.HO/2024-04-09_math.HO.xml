      <title>Constructive Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An age-old controversy in mathematics concerns the necessity and the possibility of constructive proofs. The controversy has been rekindled by recent advances which demonstrate the feasibility of a fully constructive mathematics. This nontechnical article discusses the motivating ideas behind the constructive approach to mathematics and the implications of constructive mathematics for the history of mathematics.</description>

      <title>A remarkable eelliptic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a system of plane algebraic curves defined over \Z, attached naturally to the exponential function. On of these is a remarkable curve of degree 6 that has genus equal to 1. As the sectic curve has rational points, it is an elliptic curveand can be tranformed over \Q into the curve 1584.j1 of the LMFDB. One is left to wonder what the number 11, appearing in the factorisation 1584=2^4.3^2.11 has to do with the exponential function.</description>

      <title>Database-Driven Mathematical Inquiry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in computing have changed not only the nature of mathematical computation, but mathematical proof and inquiry itself. While artificial intelligence and formalized mathematics have been the major topics of this conversation, this paper explores another class of tools for advancing mathematics research: databases of mathematical objects that enable semantic search. In addition to defining and exploring examples of these tools, we illustrate a particular line of research that was inspired and enabled by one such database.</description>

      <title>The double gamma function and Vladimir Alekseevsky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the Weierstrass product for the entire function $\sin \pi x$ and taking half of the factors corresponding to non-positive roots, we obtain the function $1/\Gamma(x)$. Considering the Weierstrass product for the Jacobi theta function $\vartheta_1$ and taking quarter of the factors (corresponding to the positive quadrant in the lattice $n_1\omega+n_2\omega_2$ of periods), we come to the double gamma function. It satisfies big collection of identities parallel to properties of $\Gamma(x)$. We discuss the seminal work (1888-89) by V.P.Alekseevsky, where the double gamma function was introduced and investigated. His standpoint was the paper by P.\'E.Appell (1881) on extensions of Heine's $q$-version of the Euler gamma function. For the case of equal periods $\omega_1=\omega_2$, a function equivalent to the double gamma function was introduced earlier by H.Kinkelin (1860). After Alekseevsky, the double gamma function was a topic of investigations by E.W.Barnes, J.Beaupin, G.H.Hardy, V.A.Steklov in 1899-1907. It was quite unusual compared to special functions known at that time. Despite obviously bright publications, the function was forgotten until 1976-1979, when it appeared again in works by T.Shintani and M.V.Vign\'eras. In the same time, Shintani introduced the double sine as a product of two double gammas. We also discuss the biography of Alekseevsky (1858-1916).</description>
