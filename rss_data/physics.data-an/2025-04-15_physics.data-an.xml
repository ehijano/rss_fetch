      <title>Entropically Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations of agents often exhibit surprising collective behavior emerging from simple local interactions. The common belief is that the agents must posses a certain level of cognitive abilities for such an emerging collective behavior to occur. However, contrary to this assumption, it is also well known that even noncognitive agents are capable of displaying nontrivial behavior. Here we consider an intermediate case, where the agents borrow a little bit from both extremes. We assume a population of agents performing random-walk in a bounded environment, on a square lattice. The agents can sense their immediate neighborhood, and they will attempt to move into a randomly selected empty site, by avoiding collisions.Also, the agents will temporary stop moving when they are in contact with at least two other agents. We show that surprisingly, such a rudimentary population of agents undergoes a percolation phase transition and self-organizes in a large polymer like structure, as a consequence of an attractive entropic force emerging from their restricted-valence and local spatial arrangement.</description>

      <title>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</description>

      <title>Closer look at sum uncertainty relations and related relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Noise2Ghost: Self-supervised deep convolutional reconstruction for ghost imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new self-supervised deep-learning-based Ghost Imaging (GI) reconstruction method, which provides unparalleled reconstruction performance for noisy acquisitions among unsupervised methods. We present the supporting mathematical framework and results from theoretical and real data use cases. Self-supervision removes the need for clean reference data while offering strong noise reduction. This provides the necessary tools for addressing signal-to-noise ratio concerns for GI acquisitions in emerging and cutting-edge low-light GI scenarios. Notable examples include micro- and nano-scale x-ray emission imaging, e.g., x-ray fluorescence imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Their applications include in-vivo and in-operando case studies for biological samples and batteries.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Graph Representations for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks process information on graphs represented at a given resolution scale. We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>
