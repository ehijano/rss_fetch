      <title>Remote Interference Mitigation through Null Precoding and Fractional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations (BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully automated, data-driven framework for the large-scale deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in cellular networks. Leveraging physically consistent ray tracing and empirical data from a commercial deployment in the UK, the proposed method jointly optimizes RIS placement, orientation, configuration, and base station beamforming in dense urban environments across frequency bands (corresponding to 4G, 5G, and a hypothetical 6G system). Candidate RIS locations are identified via reflection- and scattering-based heuristics using calibrated electromagnetic models within the Sionna Ray Tracing (RT) engine. Outage users are clustered to reduce deployment complexity, and the tradeoff between coverage gains and infrastructure cost is systematically evaluated. It is shown that achieving meaningful coverage improvement in urban areas requires a dense deployment of large-aperture RIS units, raising questions about cost-effectiveness. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, the complete simulation framework and RIS deployment algorithms are provided as open-source software.</description>

      <title>An information theorist's tour of differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since being proposed in 2006, differential privacy has become a standard method for quantifying certain risks in publishing or sharing analyses of sensitive data. At its heart, differential privacy measures risk in terms of the differences between probability distributions, which is a central topic in information theory. A differentially private algorithm is a channel between the underlying data and the output of the analysis. Seen in this way, the guarantees made by differential privacy can be understood in terms of properties of this channel. In this article we examine a few of the key connections between information theory and the formulation/application of differential privacy, giving an ``operational significance'' for relevant information measures.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Cryptography via Universal Gr\"obner Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis $\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct $\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Distributed Quantum Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes, of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes, and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.</description>

      <title>Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation in Discrete-Modulation CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution, information reconciliation is required to extract a shared secret key from correlated random variables obtained through the quantum channel. Reverse reconciliation (RR) is generally preferred, since the eavesdropper has less information about Bob's measurements than about Alice's transmitted symbols. When discrete modulation formats are employed, however, soft information is available only at Bob's side, while Alice has access only to hard information (her transmitted sequence). This forces her to rely on hard-decision decoding to recover Bob's key.
  In this work, we introduce a novel RR technique for PAM (and QAM) in which Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to help Alice recover Bob's key, while leaking no additional information about the key to an eavesdropper. We assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of achievable secret key rate (SKR) and its bounds, showing that the achievable SKR closely approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR. Finally, we implement the scheme at the coded level using binary LDPC codes with belief-propagation decoding, assess its bit-error rate through numerical simulations, compare the observed gain with theoretical predictions from the achievable SKR, and discuss the residual gap.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximization for Multiuser Communications with Flexible-Sector 6DMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective and easily-deployable flexible-sector six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) architecture for future wireless communication networks, which enables flexible antenna configurations to match users' spatial distribution for capacity enhancement. Different from conventional sectorized base station (BS) with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the flexible-sector 6DMA-enabled BS employs multiple directional sector antenna arrays that can flexibly move along a common circular track. By properly moving antennas across sectors and rotating all sector antenna arrays synchronously, the flexible-sector BS can adjust the coverage regions of all sectors with flexible antenna allocations over them. In particular, we consider the multiuser downlink communication employing the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to serve users in each sector. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the sector rotation and the antenna allocation at the flexible-sector BS to maximize the average common throughput achievable for all users based on their spatial distribution. We solve this non-convex optimization problem by deriving closed-form solutions and thereby analyze the effect of users' spatial distribution on the achievable common throughput. It is shown that equal user distribution over sectors is optimal for maximizing the common throughput. Motivated by this result, we further develop a low-complexity suboptimal solution for the sector rotation that minimizes the variance of user numbers across sectors. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify our analytical results and validate the performance of our proposed solutions. It is demonstrated that the flexible-sector BS significantly improves the network throughput as compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Forward-Forward Autoencoder Architectures for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings compared to BP-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Repeated-and-Offset QPSK for DFT-s-OFDM in Satellite Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite networks, we consider an adaptation of offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK), used with single-carrier waveform in traditional satellite systems, to discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) waveform employed in the uplink of terrestrial systems. We introduce a new order-one constellation modulation, termed repeated-and-offset QPSK (RO-QPSK), derive its basic properties, and compare it with pi/2-BPSK with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS), as supported in 5G. RO-QPSK naturally produces a Hann-window-shaped spectrum, resulting in a very low maximum peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on the order of 2 dB. Moreover, with single-tap equalization and symbol combining at the receiver, RO-QSPK can improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) compared to pi/2-BPSK with FDSS, in narrowband and/or moderately frequency-selective channels, as encountered in satellite communications. A moderate FDSS can also be combined with RO-QSPK to further reduce the PAPR while providing similar performance. Of independent interest, general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM are also provided.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized) Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 &lt; p \leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean ($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).</description>

Abstract: Celebrated breakthrough sparsity theorem obtained independently by Donoho and Elad \textit{[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003]} and Gribonval and Nielsen \textit{[IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2003]} and Fuchs \textit{[IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2004]} says that unique sparse solution to NP-Hard $\ell_0$-minimization problem can be obtained using unique solution to P-Type $\ell_1$-minimization problem. In this paper, we extend their result to abstract Banach spaces using 1-approximate Schauder frames. We notice that the `normalized' condition for Hilbert spaces can be generalized to a larger extent when we consider Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper classifies the derivations of twisted group algebras in terms of the generators and defining relations of the group. In particular, we generalize some know results over group algebras to the case of twisted group algebras. We will give necessary and sufficient condition for a map defined over the generators to be extended to a derivation over a twisted group ring. We present how this results can be use in case of an abelian group or dihedral group. We also present how this results can be use to compute the first Hochschild cohomology group of twisted group algebras.</description>

      <title>Bounds in the Projective Unitary Group with Respect to Global Phase Invariant Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a global phase-invariant metric in the projective unitary group PUn, relevant for universal quantum computing. We obtain the volume and measure of small metric ball in PUn and derive the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds in PUn. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the kissing radius of the codebooks in PUn as a function of the minimum distance. Using the lower bound of the kissing radius, we find a tight Hamming bound. Also, we establish bounds on the distortion-rate function for quantizing a source uniformly distributed over PUn. As example codebooks in PUn, we consider the projective Pauli and Clifford groups, as well as the projective group of diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy, and find their minimum distances. For any code in PUn with given cardinality we provide a lower bound of covering radius. Also, we provide expected value of the covering radius of randomly distributed points on PUn, when cardinality of code is sufficiently large. We discuss codebooks at various stages of the projective Clifford + T and projective Clifford + S constructions in PU2, and obtain their minimum distance, distortion, and covering radius. Finally, we verify the analytical results by simulation.</description>

      <title>IECZ-III: Hardcore Condensation Lift with Size-Aware Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a compact, size-aware blueprint for transferring structure through gadget lifts. Two low-order invariants -- cumulative mod-$q$ Fourier mass up to degree $k$ and noise stability $\mathrm{Stab}_\rho$ -- are treated as a reusable "profile" tied to the gadget's affine interface. Under coordinate permutations ($\Delta=1$) the profile is preserved exactly; under bounded fan-in the degree budget relaxes by at most $+\Delta k$ (i.e., $k \mapsto k + \Delta k$), with all overheads tracked explicitly. In a balanced window $m=(1+\gamma)n$ the framework yields a distributional lower bound for a monotone cost (Erasure Complexity, EC) and an "echo" to correlation against size-aware $\mathrm{AC}^0{+}\log$ and to logarithmic degree in the polynomial-calculus setting. The accounting keeps total-variation non-expansion and a single $O(\log N)$ prefix-free header visible end to end, avoiding hidden slack.</description>

      <title>Decomposer Networks: Deep Component Analysis and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases and the second generalized Hamming weight of a linear code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that for binary codes one can use Gr\"obner bases to obtain a subset of codewords of minimal support that can be used to determine the second generalized Hamming weight of the code. In this paper we establish conditions on a nonbinary code under which the same property holds. We also construct a family of codes over any nonbinary finite field where the property does not hold. Furthermore, we prove that whenever the subset obtained via Gr\"obner basis suffices to determine the second generalized Hamming weight, this invariant can also be recovered from the degrees of the syzygies of a minimal free resolution.</description>

      <title>Conformal Sparsification for Bandwidth-Efficient Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary operating regimes.</description>

      <title>The algorithmic regulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <title>Preserving Core Structures of Social Networks via Information Guided Multi-Step Graph Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks often contain dense and overlapping connections that obscure their essential interaction patterns, making analysis and interpretation challenging. Identifying the structural backbone of such networks is crucial for understanding community organization, information flow, and functional relationships. This study introduces a multi-step network pruning framework that leverages principles from information theory to balance structural complexity and task-relevant information. The framework iteratively evaluates and removes edges from the graph based on their contribution to task-relevant mutual information, producing a trajectory of network simplification that preserves most of the inherent semantics. Motivated by gradient boosting, we propose IGPrune, which enables efficient, differentiable optimization to progressively uncover semantically meaningful connections. Extensive experiments on social and biological networks show that IGPrune retains critical structural and functional patterns. Beyond quantitative performance, the pruned networks reveal interpretable backbones, highlighting the method's potential to support scientific discovery and actionable insights in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.</description>

      <title>A Distance Measure for Random Permutation Set: From the Layer-2 Belief Structure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory (RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.</description>

      <title>How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language - has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.</description>

      <title>Redundancy as a Structural Information Principle for Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure) and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems, such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic world of communication and the finite world of learning.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Representation Efficiency of Barlow Twins: An Information-Geometric Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.</description>

      <title>CSI Prediction Using Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder, which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two recent developments of the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm, have significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes in this framework.
  In this note, we embed the restricted decoding problem within these frameworks. We propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based candidates in the NIST competition.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic analysis of temporal dependence in discrete stochastic processes: Application to precipitation predictability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the temporal dependence of precipitation is key to improving weather predictability and developing efficient stochastic rainfall models. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to quantify memory effects in discrete stochastic processes and apply it to daily precipitation records across the contiguous United States. The method is based on the predictability gain, a quantity derived from block entropy that measures the additional information provided by higher-order temporal dependencies. This statistic, combined with a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing and Fisher's method, enables a robust memory estimator from finite data. Tests with generated sequences show that this estimator outperforms other model-selection criteria such as AIC and BIC. Applied to precipitation data, the analysis reveals that daily rainfall occurrence is well described by low-order Markov chains, exhibiting regional and seasonal variations, with stronger correlations in winter along the West Coast and in summer in the Southeast, consistent with known climatological patterns. Overall, our findings establish a framework for building parsimonious stochastic descriptions, useful when addressing spatial heterogeneity in the memory structure of precipitation dynamics, and support further advances in real-time, data-driven forecasting schemes.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network (NOS) Scheduling for 6G O-RAN: Spectral Margin and Delay-Tail Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes. A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$ and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta&gt;0$ and derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller 99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.</description>

Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency, and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices. Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically, especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of fixed rank matrices with integer coefficients over a number field K/Q and bounded norm. As an application, we derive an approximate Rogers integral formula for discrete sets of module lattices obtained from lifts of algebraic codes. This in turn implies that the moment estimates of random lattices with a number field structure also carry through for large enough discrete sets of module lattices.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Rate Channel Codes in $\texttt{GF}(p^{n^{2}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.11296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A code $\mathcal{C}(n, k, d)$ defined over $\texttt{GF}(q^{n})$ is conventionally designed to encode a $k$-symbol user data into a codeword of length $n$, resulting in a fixed-rate coding. This paper proposes a coding procedure to derive a multiple-rate code from existing channel codes defined over a composite field $\texttt{GF}(q^{n})$. Formally, by viewing a symbol of $\texttt{GF}(q^{n})$ as an $n$-tuple over the base field $\texttt{GF}(q)$, the proposed coding scheme employs children codes $\mathcal{C}_{1}(n, 1), \mathcal{C}_{2}(n, 2), \ldots, \mathcal{C}_{n}(n, n)$ defined over $\texttt{GF}(q)$ to encode user messages of arbitrary lengths and incorporates a variable-rate feature. In sequel, unlike the conventional block codes of length $n$, the derived multiple-rate code of fixed blocklength $n$ (over $\texttt{GF}(q^{n})$) can be used to encode and decode user messages ${\bf m}$ (over $\texttt{GF}(q)$) of arbitrary lengths $|{\bf m}| = k, k+1, \ldots, kn$, thereby supporting a range of information rates - inclusive of the code rates $1/n, 2/n, \ldots, (k-1)/n$, in addition to the existing code rate $k/n$. The proposed multiple-rate coding scheme is also equipped with a decoding strategy, wherein the identification of children encoded user messages of variable length are carried out through a simple procedure using {\it orthogonal projectors}.</description>

      <title>Towards Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: New Metrics, Framework, and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Shannon's pioneering masterpiece which established the prototype of modern information theory, the goal of communications has long been promising accurate message reconstruction at a refined bit-by-bit level, which deliberately neglects the semantics/effectiveness aspect of information. Nevertheless, the recent development of wireless technologies and the spurt of deep learning (DL) techniques allow us to reclaim the meaning/usefulness aspect in the design of future 6G communication paradigms, where goal-oriented communication is becoming a trend. Age of Information (AoI), a well-known metric that captures the importance of information by recording the time elapsed from the generation time slot, has been extended to various variants, such as Value of Information (VoI), Urgency of Information (UoI), Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), and etc. While each of them proposes novel ways to measure the meaning/usefulness aspect of information, there is not yet an integrated framework encompassing all of them. To this end, we propose a novel tensor-based approach, the Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT), to unify them, which also allows more flexible and fine-grained goal characterizations. Following the proposed GoT, we architect a holistic goal-oriented framework to enable goal-oriented semantic communications, in which information perception, dissemination, and control-plane decisions are implemented in accordance with specific goals. Finally, we outline several open challenges to fulfill the vision of the GoT framework.</description>

      <title>Unified Upper Bounds on the ML decoding Error Probability of Spinal Codes over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance evaluation of particular channel coding has been a significant topic in coding theory, often involving the use of bounding techniques. This paper focuses on the new family of capacity-achieving codes, Spinal codes, to provide a comprehensive analysis framework to tightly upper bound the block error rate (BLER) of Spinal codes in the finite block length (FBL) regime. First, we resort to a variant of the Gallager random coding bound to upper bound the BLER of Spinal codes over the fading channel. Then, this paper derives a new bound without resorting to the use of Gallager random coding bound, achieving provable tightness over the wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The derived BLER upper bounds in this paper are generalized, facilitating the performance evaluations of Spinal codes over different types of fast fading channels. Over the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rician fading channels, this paper explicitly derived the BLER upper bounds on Spinal codes as case studies. Based on the bounds, we theoretically reveal that the tail transmission pattern (TTP) for ML-decoded Spinal codes remains optimal in terms of reliability performance. Simulations verify the tightness of the bounds and the insights obtained.</description>

      <title>On the Weight Spectrum of Rate-Compatible Polar Codes</title>

Abstract: The weight spectrum plays a crucial role in the performance of error-correcting codes. Despite substantial theoretical exploration of polar codes with mother code length, a framework for the weight spectrum of rate-compatible polar codes remains elusive. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting the theoretical results for enumerating the number of minimum-weight codewords for quasi-uniform punctured, Wang-Liu shortened, and bit-reversal shortened decreasing polar codes. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the average spectrum of random upper-triangular pre-transformed shortened and punctured polar codes. Notably, our algorithms operate with polynomial complexity relative to the code length. Simulation results affirm that our findings yield a precise estimation of the performance of rate-compatible polar codes.</description>

      <title>Editable-DeepSC: Reliable Cross-Modal Semantic Communications for Facial Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.</description>

      <title>Error Floor of ML-Decoded Spinal Codes in the Finite Blocklength Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinal codes is a new family of capacity-achieving rateless codes that has been shown to achieve better rate performance compared to Raptor codes, Strider codes, and rateless Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. This correspondence addresses the performance limitations of Spinal codes in the finite block length regime, uncovering an error floor phenomenon at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). We develop an analytical expression to approximate the error floor and devise SNR thresholds at which the error floor initiates. Numerical results across {Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), rayleigh, and nakagami-m fading channels} verify the accuracy of our analysis. The analysis and numerical results also show that transmitting more passes of symbols can lower the error floor but does not affect the SNR threshold, providing insights on the performance target, the working SNR region, and the code design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sum-rank codes are an important class of codes which can be utilized for linear network coding, space-time coding and distributed storage. They can not only reduce the size of network alphabet but also detect and correct more errors. Based on the duality theory of sum-rank codes [Byrne, Gluesing-Luerssen, Ravagnani, IEEE TIT, 2021] and those related theory of rank-metric codes, it is significant to study self-dual codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes in sum-rank metric. In this paper, we introduce the notion of self-dual codes and LCD codes in sum-rank metric, and obtain two methods of constructing self-dual sum-rank codes and LCD sum-rank codes from Euclidean self-dual codes and Euclidean LCD codes. Some examples of cyclic self-dual sum-rank codes and cyclic LCD sum-rank codes with good parameters are provided. In addition, we prove that there exist asymptotically good self-dual sum-rank codes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Message Secure Aggregation with Demand Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-message secure aggregation with privacy problem, in which a server aims to compute $\sf K_c\geq 1$ linear combinations of local inputs from $\sf K$ distributed users. The problem addresses two tasks: (1) security, ensuring that the server can only obtain the desired linear combinations without any else information about the users' inputs, and (2) privacy, preventing users from learning about the server's computation task. In addition, the effect of user dropouts is considered, where at most $\sf{K-U}$ users can drop out and the identity of these users cannot be predicted in advance. We propose two schemes for $\sf K_c$ is equal to (1) and $\sf 2\leq K_c\leq U-1$, respectively. For $\sf K_c$ is equal to (1), we introduce multiplicative encryption of the server's demand using a random variable, where users share coded keys offline and transmit masked models in the first round, followed by aggregated coded keys in the second round for task recovery. For $\sf{2\leq K_c \leq U-1}$, we use robust symmetric private computation to recover linear combinations of keys in the second round. The objective is to minimize the number of symbols sent by each user during the two rounds. Our proposed schemes have achieved the optimal rate region when $ \sf K_c $ is equal to (1) and the order optimal rate (within 2) when $\sf{2\leq K_c \leq U-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Task Semantic Communication: A Distributed Information Bottleneck Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers' tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks under physical limits.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Multiple-Access Channel with Cribbing Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.15589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</description>

      <title>MLorc: Momentum Low-rank Compression for Memory Efficient Large Language Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). The key idea of MLorc is to compress and reconstruct the momentum of matrix parameters during training to reduce memory consumption. Compared to LoRA, MLorc avoids enforcing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and thus enables full-parameter learning. Compared to GaLore, MLorc directly compress the momentum rather than gradients, thereby better preserving the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning. We provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under mild assumptions. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning at small ranks (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at near-linear complexity in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in computational complexity and greater clutter resilience over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\norm{\vw}$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\norm{\vw}/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O\xkh{ \sqrt{\frac{\norm{\vw}\log n }{\sqrt m}}}\norm{\vx_0}$. Here, $\vx_0 \in \C^n$ is the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, a upper error bound and its corresponding minimax lower bound are also provided. Our results represent a significant step toward Soltanolkotabi's conjecture, offering new insights into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>Detecting Malicious Pilot Contamination in Multiuser Massive MIMO Using Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and other hypothesis testing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1/logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1/nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</description>
