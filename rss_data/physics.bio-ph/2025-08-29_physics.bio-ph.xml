      <title>Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.</description>

      <title>Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies five independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Spreading Across Dynamic Mitochondrial Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of physical units can vary from a stationary set of spatially-embedded links to a collection of mobile agents that undergo transient social interactions. In living cells, mitochondria form architectures that span across these regimes, transitioning between fragmented, partly connected, and highly fused structures depending on cell type and state. Diffusive transport of biomolecular components through these networks limits the heterogeneity of the mitochondrial population. Here we address the connection between dynamic network architecture and the rate of diffusive mixing through simulations and analytic models that incorporate fusion, fission, and rearrangement. We find that the material delivered from a source to the rest of the network depends on the network dimensionality and a balance of competing timescales for encounter, fusion, and diffusive dispersion. We extract morphological and dynamic parameters for mitochondrial networks in three human cell lines, demonstrating that different cells span across both the physical and social network regimes. Mixing in mitochondrial networks is shown to be limited by material transport through connected tubules for slowly-diffusing particles and by inter-mitochondrial encounter rates for rapidly diffusing ones. These results provide a quantitative basis for predicting the homogenization of proteins, lipids, ions, or genetic material through the mitochondrial population. The general principles identified in this work capture diffusive spreading through both social and physical networks, unifying a continuum of spatial network architectures.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machine for the Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion from Single Trajectories (AnDi-ELM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of natural and artificial systems has provided several examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as anomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>MINFLUX -- molecular resolution with minimal photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical super-resolution microscopy is a key technology for structural biology that offers high imaging contrast and live-cell compatibility. Minimal (fluorescence) photons flux microscopy, or MINFLUX, is an emerging super-resolution technique that localizes single fluorophores with high spatiotemporal precision by targeted scanning of a patterned excitation beam featuring a minimum. MINFLUX offers super-resolution imaging with nanometer resolution. When tracking single fluorophores, MINFLUX can achieve nanometer spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution over long tracks, greatly outperforming camera-based techniques. In this review, we present the basic working principle of MINFLUX and explain how it can reach high photon efficiencies. We then outline the advantages and limitations of MINFLUX, describe recent extensions and variations of MINFLUX and, finally, provide an outlook for future developments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.</description>

      <title>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</description>

      <title>Cell-Scale Dynamic Modeling of Membrane Interactions with Arbitrarily Shaped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.</description>
