      <title>A guide to modeling plasmid co-infection dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile genetic elements like conjugative plasmids play a crucial role in shaping the genetic content and population dynamics of bacterial species. Bacterial populations often contain not one, but multiple co-circulating MGEs, which modify each other's population dynamics in a myriad of ways. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to gain intuition about the expected eco-evolutionary dynamics in a biological system with many interacting players. Here, we detail how to develop a mathematical model of plasmid co-infection, how to implement this computationally, and we give examples of what can be learned from such models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing chemoradiotherapy for malignant gliomas: a validated mathematical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malignant gliomas (MGs), particularly glioblastoma, are among the most aggressive brain tumors, with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Maximal safe resection and the so-called Stupp protocol are the standard first-line therapies. Despite combining radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an intensive manner, it provides limited survival benefits over radiation therapy alone, underscoring the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that alternative dosing schedules, such as less aggressive regimens with extended intervals between consecutive treatment applications, may improve outcomes, enhancing survival, delaying the emergence of resistance, and minimizing side effects. In this study, we develop, calibrate, and validate in animal models a novel ordinary differential equation-based mathematical model, using in vivo data to describe MG dynamics under combined chemoradiotherapy. The proposed model incorporates key biological processes, including cancer cell dormancy, phenotypic switching, drug resistance through persister cells, and treatment-induced effects. Through in silico trials, we identified optimized combination treatment protocols that may outperform the standard Stupp protocol. Finally, we computationally extrapolated the results obtained from the in vivo animal model to humans, showing up to a four-fold increase in median survival with protracted administration protocols in silico. Although further experimental and clinical validation is required, our framework provides a computational foundation to optimize and personalize treatment strategies for MG and potentially other cancers with similar biological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Applied Antifragility in Natural Systems: Evolutionary Antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter introduces evolutionary antifragility as the time-scale interaction characteristics of a natural dynamic system. It describes the benefit derived from input distribution unevenness, based on the emergent system dynamics and its uncertain and volatile interactions with the operating environment described by unknown disturbances. We consider methods for the detection, analysis, and modelling of cancer, environmental, microbiota, and social systems antifragility.

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection, known as herd immunity. Studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. Here, we theoretically explore network epidemic models to show that the opposite can also be true. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the biased distribution of immunity toward socially active individuals enhances herd immunity, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in a low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for a careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>
