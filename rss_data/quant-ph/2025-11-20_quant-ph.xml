      <title>An Error Correctable Implication Algebra for a System of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Lukasiewicz logic as a viable system for an implication algebra on a system of qubits. Our results show that the three valued Lukasiewicz logic can be embedded in the stabilized space of an arbitrary quantum error correcting stabilizer code. We then fully characterize the non trivial errors that may occur up to group isomorphism. Lastly, we demonstrate by explicit algorithmic example, how any algorithm consistent with the Lukasiewicz logic can immediately run on a quantum system and utilize the indeterminate state.</description>

      <title>The PID Controller Strikes Back: Classical Controller Helps Mitigate Barren Plateaus in Noisy Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) combine the advantages of classical optimization and quantum computation, making them one of the most promising approaches in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Dependent Performance of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise to redefine the boundaries of computational science, offering the potential for exponential speedups in solving complex problems across chemistry, optimization, and materials science. Yet, their practical utility remains constrained by unpredictable performance degradation under real-world noise conditions. A key question is how problem structure itself influences algorithmic resilience. In this work, we present a comprehensive, hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors, revealing that algorithmic performance is exquisitely sensitive to problem structure. Our results reveal average success rates of 100.0\% (ideal simulation), 85.2\% (noisy emulation), and 26.4\% (real hardware), representing a dramatic 58.8\% average performance gap between noisy emulation and real hardware execution. With quantum state tomography confirming corresponding average state fidelities of 0.993, 0.760, and a 0.234 fidelity drop to hardware. Performance degrades dramatically from 75.7\% success for sparse patterns to complete failure for high-density 10-qubit patterns. Most strikingly, quantum state tomography reveals a near-perfect correlation between pattern density and state fidelity degradation, providing the fundamental explanation for observed performance patterns. The catastrophic fidelity collapse observed in real hardware measurements -- dropping to 0.111 compared to the predicted 0.763 -- underscores severe limitations in current noise models for capturing structure-dependent error mechanisms. Our work establishes pattern-dependent performance as a critical consideration for quantum algorithm deployment and provides a quantitative framework for predicting algorithm feasibility in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Generalized Density Functional Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is an indispensable ab initio method in both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the quantum Mpemba effect against state-preparation errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Codes: One Code To Rule Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the analogy between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, we define an intrinsic quantum code as a subspace of a group representation. We show how this abstract code rules over any physical (extrinsic) realization by dictating its error-correction properties. By finding one intrinsic code, we simultaneously uncover properties of all its realizations. This approach brings diverse codes into a unified framework and binds them through a single underlying symmetry.</description>

      <title>Time complexity in preparing metrologically useful quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental time complexity, as constrained by Lieb-Robinson bounds, for preparing entangled states useful in quantum metrology. We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^\alpha$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \sim N^{1+\gamma}$ where $\gamma \in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($\alpha &gt; 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \gtrsim L^\gamma$, where $L \sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \gtrsim L^{\gamma(\alpha-2d)}$ for $2d &lt; \alpha &lt; 2d+1$, $t \gtrsim \log L$ for $(2-\gamma)d &lt; \alpha &lt; 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $\alpha &lt; (2-\gamma)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^\alpha$. We further show that these bounds are saturable, up to sub-polynomial corrections, for all $\alpha$ at the Heisenberg limit ($\gamma=1$) and for $\alpha &gt; (2-\gamma)d$ when $\gamma&lt;1$. Our results establish a benchmark for the time-optimality of protocols that prepare metrologically useful quantum states.</description>

      <title>Exact Factorization of Unitary Transformations with Spin-Adapted Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is essential for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions. Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>A fast and frugal Gaussian Boson Sampling emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If classical algorithms have been successful in reproducing the estimation of expectation values of observables of some quantum circuits using off-the-shelf computing resources, matching the performance of the most advanced quantum devices on sampling problems usually requires extreme cost in terms of memory and computing operations, making them accessible to only a handful of supercomputers around the world. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a classical simulation outperforming Gaussian boson sampling experiments of one hundred modes on established benchmark tests using a single CPU or GPU. Being embarrassingly parallelizable, a small number of CPUs or GPUs allows us to match previous sampling rates that required more than one hundred GPUs. We believe algorithmic and implementation improvements will generalize our tools to photo-counting, single-photon inputs, and pseudo-photon-number-resolving scenarios beyond one thousand modes. Finally, most of the innovations in our tools remain valid for generic probability distributions over binary variables, rendering it potentially applicable to the simulation of qubit-based sampling problems and creating classical surrogates for classical-quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Globalized critical quantum metrology in dynamics of quantum Rabi model by auxiliary nonlinear term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter interactions, the finite-component quantum phase transition (QPT) in the QRM has established a paradigmatic application for critical quantum metrology (CQM). However, such a paradigmatic application is restricted to a local regime of the QPT which has only a single critical point. In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation.</description>

      <title>The Most Informative Cram\'er--Rao Bound for Quantum Two-Parameter Estimation with Pure State Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal measurements for quantum multiparameter estimation are complicated by the uncertainty principle. Generally, there is a trade-off between the precision with which different parameters can be simultaneously estimated. The task of determining the minimum achievable estimation error is a central task of multiparameter quantum metrology. For estimating parameters encoded in pure quantum states, the ultimate limit is known, but is given by the solution of a non-trivial minimisation problem. We present a new expression for the achievable bound for two-parameter estimation with pure states that is considerably simpler. We also determine the optimal measurements, completing the problem of two-parameter estimation with pure state probes. To demonstrate the utility of our result, we determine the precision limit for estimating displacements using grid states.</description>

      <title>Time series learning in a many-body Rydberg system with emergent collective nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting Rydberg atoms constitute a versatile platform for the realization of non-equilibrium states of matter. Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Generation of 10-dB squeezed light from a broadband waveguide optical parametric amplifier with improved phase locking method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15082v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report generation of 10.1\pm0.2-dB squeezed light from a broadband periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Based on our previous report where a similar PPLN waveguide shows 8.3-dB squeezing [T. Kashiwazaki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 122, 234003 (2023)], we reduce phase fluctuations and overall optical losses in the measurement system. In particular, we introduce a novel phase detection technique that does not require tapping a part of the squeezed light to get a phase locking signal. We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping. With all these improvements, the phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and the total optical loss from 12\% to 8\%. Achieving more than 10 dB of squeezing by the broadband waveguide OPA is a significant step towards realization of fault-tolerant ultra-fast universal optical quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Work-minimizing protocols in driven-dissipative quantum systems: An impulse-ansatz approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics sets a lower bound on the work required to drive a system between thermal equilibrium states, with equality attained in the quasistatic limit. For finite-time processes, part of the extractable work is inevitably dissipated, motivating the search for driving protocols that minimize the work. While classical stochastic systems have been extensively explored, quantum analyses remain limited and often rely on Markovian master equations valid only in the weak-coupling regime. Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times. We also identify cases in which the widely used Markovian master equation fails even at weak coupling, underscoring the need for fully quantum approaches to finite-time thermodynamic optimization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trotterization: Variational Product Formulas for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational alternative to the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition that provides greater control over errors while preserving the unitary structure of time evolution. The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the variational parameters up to cubic order in time, valid for generic Hamiltonians. These approximations enable long-time quantum simulations with improved accuracy over equivalent Suzuki decompositions, providing ready-to-use evolution formulas that match Suzuki's gate complexity while delivering better performance.</description>

      <title>Radial Fast Entangling Gates Under Micromotion in Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromotion in radio-frequency ion traps is generally considered detrimental for quantum logic gates, and is typically minimized in state-of-the-art experiments. However, as a deterministic effect, it can be incorporated into quantum control frameworks aimed at designing high-fidelity quantum logic controls. In this work, we demonstrate that micromotion can be beneficial to the design of fast gates utilizing the radial modes of a two-ion crystal, particularly in the sub-trap-period regime where high-fidelity control sequences are identified with operation times ranging from hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds. Through analysis of select fast gate solutions, we uncover the physical origin of micromotion enhancement and further study the induced gate error under experimental noises and control imperfections. This analysis establishes the feasibility of realising high-fidelity entangling gates in hundreds of nanoseconds using the micromotion-sensitive radial modes of trapped-ion crystals.</description>

      <title>Fail fast: techniques to probe rare events in quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of quantum error correction is to create logical qubits with very low error rates (e.g. 1e-12) and assemble them into large-scale quantum computers capable of performing many (e.g. billions) of logical gates on many (e.g. thousands) of logical qubits. However, it is necessarily difficult to directly assess the performance of such high-quality logical qubits using standard Monte Carlo sampling because logical failure events become very rare. Building on existing approaches to this problem, we develop three complementary techniques to characterize the rare-event regime for general quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes under circuit noise. (I) We propose a well-motivated, low-parameter ansatz for the failure spectrum (the fraction of fault sets of each size that fail) that empirically fits all the QEC systems we studied and predicts logical error rates at all physical error rates. (II) We find min-weight logical operators of syndrome measurement circuits and exactly compute the number of min-weight failing configurations. (III) We generalize the splitting method to qLDPC codes using multi-seeded Metropolis sampling to improve convergence for systems with many inequivalent logical operators. We apply these tools to distance-6, -12, and -18 bivariate bicycle codes under circuit noise, observing strong low-error-rate performance with the recently proposed Relay decoder but also considerable scope for further improvement.</description>

      <title>QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Thermalizing channel states for rapid qubit heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although known for negatively impacting the operation of superconducting qubits, thermal baths are shown to exert qubit control in a positive way, provided they are properly engineered. We demonstrate an experimental method to engineer the transduction of microwave driving into heat flow through a leaky resonator. Given the precise conversion, a qubit receiving the heat flow obtains a quasi-thermal equilibrium with arbitrary target temperature in hundreds of nanoseconds. We show that the dynamics of the quantum transducing process is described by thermalizing channel states, generated from the double dressings of the resonator by the semi-classical driving and the qubit-resonator coupling. Their spectrum, coupling, and driving strength determine the channel rate of energy flow, along with the relaxation rates of photon leakage into the bath. The analytical prediction is shown to match well with the experimental measurements on an Xmon qubit circuit.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-Preserving Quantum Encoding for Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently encoding classical visual data into quantum states is essential for realizing practical quantum neural networks (QNNs). However, existing encoding schemes often discard spatial and semantic information when adapting high-dimensional images to the limited qubits of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We propose a Fidelity-Preserving Quantum Encoding (FPQE) framework that performs near lossless data compression and quantum encoding. FPQE employs a convolutional encoder-decoder to learn compact multi-channel representations capable of reconstructing the original data with high fidelity, which are then mapped into quantum states through amplitude encoding. Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains. By maintaining fidelity during classical to quantum transformation, FPQE establishes a scalable and hardware efficient foundation for high-quality quantum representation learning.</description>

      <title>QSentry: Backdoor Detection for Quantum Neural Networks via Measurement Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an important model for implementing quantum machine learning (QML), while they demonstrate a high degree of vulnerability to backdoor attacks similar to classical networks. To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods. This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in QML.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequality Violation with Vacuum-One-Photon Number Superposition States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum technologies, and the realization of photonic entanglement necessarily relies on interaction with matter. Resonance fluorescence (RF), originating from the coherent interaction between a driving field and a two-level system, plays a pivotal role in quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a novel route to entanglement generation based on RF from a single quantum dot. Rather than relying on generation of multiphoton states, our approach directly exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation. By delocalizing this superposition via a beam splitter, we realize time-bin entanglement and observe a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry. Our scheme removes the need for multiphoton generation, simplifies the experimental requirements, and establishes a scalable pathway toward solid-state entangled photon sources.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Transducers in a Hybrid Rydberg Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a topological transport platform for microwave-to-optical conversion at the single-photon level in a Rydberg atom-cavity setting. This setting leverages a hybrid dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) configuration, where a microwave resonator couples an optical cavity mediated by a Rydberg atom ensemble. Our scheme uniquely enables the formation of Fock-state lattices (FSLs), where photon hopping rates depend on photon numbers in individual sites. We identify an inherent zero-energy mode corresponding to the dark state of the dual-mode JC model. This enables to build a high-efficiency single-photon transducer, which realizes topologically protected photon transport between the microwave and optical modes. Crucially, we show analytically that the FSL features continuous variations of the winding number. Our work establishes a robust mechanism for efficient quantum transduction in synthetic dimensions and opens avenues for exploring topological physics with continuous winding numbers in the atom-cavity system.</description>

      <title>Overview of Routing Approaches in Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles. However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although they have enabled several advances in the field of optomechanics, optomechanical disk resonators have not yet been operated in the quantum regime. We present the first experimental demonstration of an optomechanical disk resonator prepared in the quantum ground state. With a gigahertz frequency, the mechanical breathing mode of the investigated semiconductor disk reaches a level of excitation below a single phonon when cooled in a dilution refrigerator. We quantify the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode by performing Brillouin sideband spectroscopy: a conical optical fiber is evanescently coupled to the disk optical whispering-gallery mode, and Stokes and anti-Stokes photons scattered by phonon emission and absorption are counted on a single-photon detector. We measure a suppression of the absorption process corresponding to a phonon occupancy of $0.66\pm0.20$. We experimentally investigate the mechanisms ruling laser-induced heating, which limits the lowest measurable phonon occupancy, and notably witness an extra-cavity heating effect.</description>

      <title>Stochastic unravelings for trace-nonpreserving open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic unravelings allow to efficiently simulate open system dynamics, yet their application has traditionally been restricted to master equations that preserve both Hermiticity and trace. In this work, we introduce a general framework that extends piecewise-deterministic unravelings to arbitrary trace-nonpreserving master equations, requiring only positivity and Hermiticity of the dynamics. Our approach includes, as special cases, unravelings of arbitrary dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, evolutions interpolating between fully Lindblad and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generators, and equations employed in the derivation of full counting statistics, for which we show it can be used to obtain the moments of the associated probability distribution. The framework is suitable for both trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes through stochastic disappearance and replication of the stochastic realizations, and it is compatible with different unraveling schemes and with reverse jumps in the non-Markovian regime. Thereby, our approach provides a powerful and versatile simulation method that significantly broadens the applicability of stochastic techniques for open system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Adaptive Diversity Schemes in Quantum MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum networks evolve toward a full quantum Internet, reliable transmission in quantum multiple-input multiple-output (QuMIMO) settings becomes essential, yet remains difficult due to noise, crosstalk, and the mixing of quantum information across subchannels. To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes. A cloning asymmetry index is introduced to quantify the distribution of quantum information across the multiple subchannels across these operating conditions. The results show that the proposed scheme yields significant fidelity gains in crosstalk-dominated settings and automatically adapts to channel symmetry and channel conditions. This work provides design guidelines for future QuMIMO systems and establishes a robust baseline for more advanced transmission and decoding strategies.</description>

      <title>Constraint-preserving quantum algorithm for the multi-frequency antenna placement problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization typically encode constraints as soft penalties within the objective function, which can reduce efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art classical methods that instead exploit constraints to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Although solving this issue for an arbitrary problem is inherently a hard task, we address this challenge for a specific problem in the field of telecommunications, the multi-frequency antenna placement problem, by introducing a constraint-preserving quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA). To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints. We first benchmark the performance of this quantum algorithm against a basic version of QAA, demonstrating superior performance in terms of feasibility and success probability. We then apply this algorithm to large problem sizes with hundreds of variables using a constraint-aware decomposition method based on the SPLIT framework. Our results indicate competitive performance against other large-scale classical approaches, such as branch-and-bound and simulated annealing. This work supports previous claims that constraint-aware algorithms are crucial for the practical and efficient application of quantum methods in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.</description>

      <title>QTIS: A QAOA-Based Quantum Time Interval Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task scheduling with constrained time intervals and limited resources remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as manufacturing, logistics, cloud computing, and healthcare. This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments.</description>

      <title>The impact of multimode sources on DLCZ type quantum repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.</description>

      <title>Gleason's Theorem for a Qubit as Part of a Composite System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Gleason's theorem to the two-dimensional Hilbert space of a qubit by invoking the standard axiom that describes composite quantum systems. The tensor-product structure allows us to derive density matrices and Born's rule for $d=2$ from a simple requirement: the probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes must not depend on whether a system is considered on its own or as a subsystem of a larger one. In line with Gleason's original theorem, our approach assigns probabilities only to projection-valued measures, while other known extensions rely on considering more general classes of measurements.</description>

      <title>Navigating Quantum Missteps in Agent-Based Modeling: A Schelling Model Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum state preparation of multivariate functions using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the preparation of high-dimensional functions on quantum computers, we introduce tensor network algorithms that are efficient with regard to dimensionality, optimize circuits composed of hardware-native gates and take gate errors into account during the optimization. To avoid the notorious barren plateau problem of vanishing gradients in the circuit optimization, we smoothly transform the circuit from an easy-to-prepare initial function into the desired target function. We show that paradigmatic multivariate functions can be accurately prepared such as, by numerical simulations, a 17-dimensional Gaussian encoded in the state of 102 qubits and, through experiments, a 9-dimensional Gaussian realized using 54 qubits on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Quantum measurement tomography with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from gradient-descent methods developed for data processing in quantum state tomography [\href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ae0baa}{Quantum Sci.~Technol.~\textbf{10} 045055 (2025)}] and quantum process tomography [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.150402}{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{130}, 150402 (2023)}], we introduce stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for fast quantum measurement tomography (QMT), applicable to both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum systems -- thus completing the tomography trio. A measurement device or detector in a quantum experiment is characterized by a set of positive operator-valued measure (POVM) elements; the goal of QMT is to estimate these operators from experimental data. To ensure physically valid (positive and complete) POVM reconstructions, we propose two distinct parameterization schemes within the SGD framework: one leveraging optimization on a Stiefel manifold and one based on Hermitian operator normalization via eigenvalue scaling. Within the SGD-QMT framework, we further investigate two loss functions: mean squared error, equivalent to L2 or Euclidean norm, and average negative log-likelihood, inspired by maximum likelihood estimation. We benchmark performance against state-of-the-art constrained convex optimization methods. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to standard methods, our SGD-QMT algorithms offer significantly lower computational cost, superior reconstruction fidelity, and enhanced robustness to noise. We make a Python implementation of the SGD-QMT algorithms publicly available at \href{https://github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}{github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}.</description>

      <title>Phonon scattering from spatial relaxation of one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium relaxation of a spatial density modulation in a one-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose gas, and its connection to the equilibrium scattering rate $\smash{\gamma_k\propto k^{3/2}}$ of the system's phononic excitations. We show that the relaxation is generally governed by a nonequilibrium scattering rate $\gamma_{k,t}$ coupled to quantum fluctuations, which approaches its equilibrium value $\gamma_k$ only at long times. Numerical simulations of quantum kinetic equations reveal an algebraic convergence, $\smash{\gamma_{k,t} - \gamma_k \sim t^{-2/3}}$, confirmed by analytical predictions. More broadly, our results establish a theoretical framework for experimentally probing phonon dynamics through the temporal evolution of local perturbations in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Unraveling additional quantum many-body scars of the spin-$1$ $XY$ model with Fock-space cages and commutant algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing entanglement at finite temperature: how does a "classical" paramagnet become a quantum spin liquid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Inverse Design of Multi-Layer Metasurface Cavities for Dual Resonance Enhancement of Nanodiamond Single Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds (neutral NV0 (wavelength 575 nm) and negative NV- (wavelength 637 nm)) represent promising platforms for quantum nanophotonics applications, yet their emission efficiencies remain constrained by weak light-matter interactions. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Routing Problems via Quantum Graph Attention Network Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a fundamental NP-hard task in intelligent transportation systems with broad applications in logistics and distribution. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.</description>

      <title>Note on Logical Gates by Gauge Field Formalism of Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge field formalism, or operator-valued cochain formalism, has recently emerged as a powerful framework for describing quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. In this work, we extend this framework to construct a broad class of logical gates for general CSS codes, including the S, Hadamard, T, and (multi-)controlled-Z gates, under the condition where fault-tolerance or circuit-depth optimality is not necessarily imposed. We show that these logical gates can be expressed as exponential of polynomial functions of the electric and magnetic gauge fields, which allows us to derive explicit decompositions into physical gates. We further prove that their logical action depends only on the (co)homology classes of the corresponding logical qubits, establishing consistency as logical operations. Our results provide a systematic method for formulating logical gates for general CSS codes, offering new insights into the interplay between quantum error correction, algebraic topology, and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Refraction Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism that produces a Hall-like response in time-reversal-invariant materials, driven entirely by geometric effects. Specifically, we demonstrate that a tilted potential interface causes electron wave packets to undergo a refraction-like deflection upon transmission through the barrier, leading to a finite transverse current and a corresponding Hall conductance. Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response. These findings establish a fundamentally distinct class of Hall-like transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Axiomatising the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We axiomatise the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, using exclusively purely categorical conditions. Our axioms are chosen with the aim of an easy interpretability: two of them describe the composition of objecs, two further ones deal with the decomposition of objects, and a final axiom expresses a symmetry property.
  The categorical reconstruction of complex Hilbert spaces addresses foundational issues in quantum physics. We present a simplified alternative to recent characterisations.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish exact scalings for the maximal group velocity of translation-invariant quantum walks in periodic electric fields. Our main result shows that the maximal group velocity decays exponentially with the period of the field in the whole parameter range, thus affirming a conjecture of arXiv:2302.01869 and at the same time augmenting it to an exact equality. We further demonstrate explicit revival relations and characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum in these models. Our results apply directly also to generalized CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>Real-time Scattering in \phi^4 Theory using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior and real-time scattering dynamics of the interacting $\phi^4$ quantum field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions using uniform matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. A finite-entanglement scaling analysis at $\lambda = 0.8$ bounds the critical mass-squared to $\mu_c^2 \in [-0.3190,-0.3185]$ and provides a quantitative map of the symmetric, near-critical, weakly broken, and deeply broken regimes. Using these ground states as asymptotic vacua, we simulate two-particle collisions in a sandwich geometry and extract the elastic scattering probability $P_{11\to 11}(E)$ and Wigner time delay $\Delta t(E)$ following the prescription of Jha et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023266 (2025)]. We find strongly inelastic scattering in the symmetric phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.63$, $\Delta t \simeq -180$ for $\mu^2 = 0.2$), almost perfectly elastic collisions in the spontaneously broken phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.998$, $\Delta t \simeq -270$ for $\mu^2=-0.2$ and $P_{11\to 11} \simeq 1$, $\Delta t \simeq -177.781$ for $\mu^2=-0.5$), and a breakdown of the sandwich evolution precisely at the critical coupling, which provides a dynamical signature of the quantum critical point. These results demonstrate that TDVP-based uniform matrix product states can probe nonperturbative scattering and critical dynamics in lattice $\phi^4$ theory with controlled entanglement truncation.</description>

      <title>Scalable spin squeezing from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <title>All You Need is pi: Quantum Computing with Hermitian Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal gate sets for quantum computation, when single and two qubit operations are accessible, include both Hermitian and non-Hermitian gates. Here we {utilize the fact} that any single-qubit operator may be implemented as two Hermitian gates, and thus a purely Hermitian universal set is possible. This implementation can be used to prepare high fidelity single-qubit states in the presence of amplitude errors, and helps to achieve a high fidelity single-qubit gate decomposition using four Hermitian gates. An implementational convenience can be that non-identity single-qubit Hermitian gates are equivalent to $\pi$ rotations up to a global phase. We show that a gate set comprised of $\pi$ rotations about two fixed axes, along with the CNOT gate, is universal for quantum computation. Moreover, we show that two $\pi$ rotations can transform the axis of any multi-controlled unitary, a special case being a single CNOT sufficing for any controlled $\pi$ rotation. These gates simplify the process of circuit compilation in view of their Hermitian nature. We exemplify by designing efficient circuits for a variety of controlled gates, and achieving a CNOT count reduction for the four-controlled Toffoli gate in LNN-restricted qubit connectivity.</description>

      <title>NN-AE-VQE: Neural network parameter prediction on autoencoded variational quantum eigensolvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding computational challenge is the accurate simulation of many-body particle systems. Especially for deriving key characteristics of high-impact but complex systems such as battery materials and high entropy alloys (HEA). While simple models allow for simulations of the required scale, these methods often fail to capture the complex dynamics that determine the characteristics. A long-theorized approach is to use quantum computers for this purpose, which allows for a more efficient encoding of quantum mechanical systems. In recent years, the field of quantum computing has become significantly more mature. Furthermore, the rise in integration of machine learning with quantum computing further pushes to a near-term advantage. In this work we aim to improve the well-established quantum computing method for calculating the inter-atomic potential, the variational quantum eigensolver, by presenting an auto-encoded VQE with neural-network predictions: NN-AE-VQE. We apply a quantum autoencoder for a compressed quantum state representation of the atomic system, to which a naive circuit ansatz is applied. This reduces the number of circuit parameters to optimize, while still minimal reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we train a classical neural network to predict the circuit parameters to avoid computationally expensive parameter optimization. We demonstrate these methods on a H2 molecule, achieving chemical accuracy. We believe this method shows promise of efficiently capturing highly accurate systems while omitting current bottlenecks of variational quantum algorithms. Finally, we explore options for exploiting the algorithm structure and further algorithm improvements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a toy model that obeys environmentally induced decoherence and quantum Darwinism and satisfies the decoherent histories criterion and Leggett-Garg inequalities with respect to the pointer basis. Yet, the resulting "classical" dynamics are extremely fragile and recohere after a seemingly innocent control operation. This challenges the idea that classical behaviour or the Multiverse branches can be identified by looking at the universal wave function alone. It also demonstrates that quantum Darwinism is compatible with strong non-Markovianity. Possible solutions related to Markovianity, non-integrability and an operational definition of pointer states are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: when restricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e. Pauli measurements, one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology matures, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures - in particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessarily support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization, are typically not designed for qubit links of significantly varying latency or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a hierarchical parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum systems, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains a $9.3\%$ average increase in circuit fidelity (up to $49.99\%$). Additionally, owing to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves $3.27\times$ faster compilation on average (up to $6.74\times$) over a chiplet-unaware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From fundamental sciences to economics and industry, discrete optimization problems are ubiquitous. Yet, their complexity often renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Heuristics inspired by classical physics have long played a central role in this domain. More recently, quantum annealing has emerged as a promising alternative, with hardware implementations realized on both analog and digital quantum devices. Here, we develop a heuristic inspired by quantum annealing, using Generalized Coherent States as a parameterized variational Ansatz to represent the quantum state. This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and gradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large problems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture non-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing. We benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and compare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular heuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage quantum effects for complex optimization problems, with the potential to complement or improve upon conventional alternatives in large-scale applications.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement-assisted telescopy protocols have been proposed as a means to extend the baseline of optical interferometric telescopes. However, the optimal entangled resource and a clear optimality criterion have remained unclear. Here, we propose a novel framework for systematically characterizing entanglement-assisted telescopy by integrating quantum metrology tools with the superselection rule (SSR) framework from quantum information theory. In our approach, the estimation problem in quantum telescopy is rigorously quantified using the quantum Fisher information (QFI) under SSR constraints. Building on this framework, we derive the fundamental limits of astronomical parameter estimation with finite entanglement resources and introduce new protocols that outperform previous methods and asymptotically saturate the optimal bound. Moreover, our proposed protocols are compatible with existing linear-optical technology and could inspire practical quantum telescopy schemes for near-term, lossy, and repeaterless quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: In classical statistical mechanics, the partition function is defined in phase space. We extend this concept to quantum statistical mechanics using Bohmian trajectories. The quantum partition function in phase space captures the ensemble of positions and momenta, along with the probability distribution that accounts for the inherent uncertainty in measuring particle locations. Within this framework, the quantum-to-classical transition arises naturally, maintaining consistency between dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomness is a key feature of quantum physics. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle reveals the existence of an intrinsic noise, usually explored through Gaussian squeezed states. Due to their insufficiency for quantum advantage, the focus is currently shifting towards genuinely quantum non-Gaussian states. However, while genuine quantum behavior comes naturally to discrete variable systems, its preparation and verification are difficult in continuous ones. Simultaneously, a unifying theoretical framework based on the continuous nature is missing. Here, we introduce nonlinear squeezing as a general framework to describe and verify genuine quantumness in the noise of continuous quantum states. Using this approach, we certify the non-Gaussianity of experimentally prepared multi-photon-added coherent states of light for the first time. Chiefly, we demonstrated the nonlinear squeezing corresponding to third- and fifth-order quantum nonlinearities, going significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art in quantum technology. This framework enables uncovering intricate quantum properties in cutting-edge experiments and provides an efficient tool for further development of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will study the constrained couplings in a few different models along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near-future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement fidelity limits of photonically-networked atomic qubits from recoil and timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remote entanglement of two atomic quantum memories through photonic interactions is accompanied by atomic momentum recoil. When the interactions occur at different times, such as from the random emission over the lifetime of the atomic excited state, the difference in recoil timing can expose ``which-path'' information and ultimately lead to decoherence. Time-bin encoded photonic qubits can be particularly sensitive to asynchronous recoil timing. In this paper we study the limits of entanglement fidelity in atomic systems due to recoil and other timing imbalances and show how these effects can be suppressed or even eliminated through proper experimental design.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as a $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</description>

      <title>Composable Finite-Size Security of High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links. However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses have been limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that uses only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial under rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered in free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Decoder for the Error Correcting Parity Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-step decoder for the parity code and evaluate its performance in code-capacity and faulty-measurement settings. For noiseless measurements, we find that the decoding problem can be reduced to a series of repetition codes while yielding near-optimal decoding for intermediate code sizes and achieving optimality in the limit of large codes. In the regime of unreliable measurements, the decoder demonstrates fault-tolerant thresholds above 5% at the cost of decoding a series of independent repetition codes in (1 + 1) dimensions. Such high thresholds, in conjunction with a practical decoder, efficient long-range logical gates, and suitability for planar implementation, position the parity architecture as a promising candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage on qubit platforms with strong noise bias.</description>

      <title>Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>

      <title>Tight qubit uncertainty relations studied through weak values in neutron interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In its original formulation, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle describes a trade-off relation between the error of a quantum measurement and the thereby induced disturbance on the measured object. However, this relation is not valid in general. An alternative universally valid relation was derived by Ozawa in 2003, defining error and disturbance in a general concept, experimentally accessible via a tomographic method. Later, it was shown by Hall that these errors correspond to the statistical deviation between a physical property and its estimate. Recently, it was discovered that these errors can be observed experimentally when weak values are determined through a procedure named "feedback compensation". Here, we apply this procedure for the complete experimental characterization of the error-disturbance relation between a which-way observable in an interferometer and another observable associated with the output of the interferometer, confirming the theoretically predicted relation. As expected for pure states, the uncertainty is tightly fulfilled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs) scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate an efficiency in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon, reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC), that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes according to a power-law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost, indicating that they are more stable.</description>

      <title>The Role of Symmetry in Generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference and Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer is a foundational tool in quantum optics, with both fundamental and practical significance. Earlier works identified that input-state symmetry under exchange of the two spatial modes is fundamental in the understanding of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We now show that this notion of symmetry is central to generalizing this effect. In particular, this point of view enables the construction of extensions beyond the standard two single-photon case to arbitrary input states, as well as to configurations with more than two spatial modes via a natural generalization of the beam splitter to a discrete Fourier transform interferometer. Beyond its conceptual significance, this framework offers direct insights into quantum metrology, showing how symmetry properties of input states allow the computation of explicit precision bounds. By focusing on symmetry, we provide a perspective that simplifies and unifies a range of known results, while paving the way for new developments in quantum interference and sensing.</description>

Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, the need for scalable solutions to address large-scale computational problems has become critical. Quantum supercomputers are the next upcoming frontier by enabling multiple quantum processors to collaborate effectively to solve large-scale computational problems. The emergence of quantum supercomputers necessitates an efficient interface to manage the quantum communication protocols between quantum processors. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Network Processing Unit (QNPU), which enables quantum applications to efficiently scale beyond the capacity of individual quantum processors, serving as a critical building block for future quantum supercomputers. The QNPU works alongside the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in our decoupled processing units architecture, where the QPU handles local quantum operations while the QNPU manages quantum communication between nodes. We design a comprehensive instruction set architecture (ISA) for the QNPU with high-level communication protocol abstractions, implemented via micro-operations that manage EPR resources, quantum operations, and classical communication. To facilitate programming, we introduce DistQASM, which extends OpenQASM with distributed quantum operations. We then propose a microarchitecture featuring both scalar and superscalar QNPU designs to enhance performance for communication-intensive quantum workloads. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed QNPU design with distributed quantum workloads and demonstrate that the QNPU significantly improves the efficiency of communication between quantum nodes, paving the way for quantum supercomputing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The algorithm is applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments, problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium, and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is low-degree polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling optimal generation of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum gate within the generalized Bloch vectors formalism due to the Pontryagin principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of optimal generation of N-qubit gates for closed quantum systems -- a key task for the practical implementation of various quantum applications. Based on the generalized Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system, we develop a new optimal gates generation model, which is universal in the sense that it is applicable for an arbitrary N-qubit gate, any Hamiltonian of a closed N-qubit system and within this model an optimal control is determined only by N-qubit system parameters and does not depend on its initial state. Within the developed model, the synthesis of optimal control, carried out via the Pontryagin principle, leads to the boundary value problem for the system of ODEs, which can be explored by various computational methods. Numerical experiments conducted for generation of a variety of one/two/three qubit gates demonstrate viability of the developed optimal model which allows one to generate N-qubit quantum gates with a high degree of precision.</description>

      <title>Observation of synchronization between two quantum van der Pol oscillators in trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is a hallmark of collective behavior that emerges when nonlinear systems interact, spanning scales from mechanical oscillators to planetary orbits. As a universal phenomenon it underpins the study of complex systems and has far-reaching technological implications. While classical synchronization has a long and rich history, it has not been observed experimentally between multiple quantum limit-cycle oscillators despite a decade of theoretical investigations. We realize synchronization between two quantum van der Pol oscillators by engineering dissipation in a mixed-isotope trapped-ion quantum simulator. The synchronized state is encoded in a fixed relative phase between the oscillators that is inaccessible to local measurements and only revealed through joint readout of both oscillators, in stark contrast to the classical case where synchronization can be observed via individual phase measurements. We further show that the relative phase can be precisely controlled, and that the chain of two oscillators can synchronize to an external field, suggesting applications in sensing. Our results provide a promising pathway for studying more complex synchronized quantum dynamics beyond two oscillators, where a theoretical treatment becomes increasingly challenging, and it remains to be understood whether genuinely quantum features persist in such cases.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Coupling between Motional Modes in Trapped Ion Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped-ion crystals are a leading platform for quantum information science, but achieving the high-fidelity entangling gates required for fault-tolerant quantum computing becomes harder as system size increases. As systems scale, spectral crowding makes low-order nonlinear resonances between collective motional modes increasingly common and can limit gate performance, especially in monolithic or global-mode architectures. We develop a general model to identify and simulate nonlinear motional-mode coupling (NoMoCou) arising from third-order Coulomb terms and quantify its impact on the Molmer-Sorensen gate across linear chains and 2D crystals in rf and Penning traps. We delineate the regimes where NoMoCou dominates the error budget and provide design rules: detune operating points from low-order resonances, tune trap anisotropy to reshape spectra, and shape gate waveforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Nature of Depth-1 Equivariant Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Chemistry on Quantum Computers with Fermionic Linear Optical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and open source a quantum circuit simulator tailored to chemistry applications. More specifically, our simulator can compute the Born-rule probabilities of samples obtained from circuits containing passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. We support both approximate and exact calculation of probabilities, and for approximate probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the circuit's controlled-phase gate angles. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local cluster unitary Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead. More generally, we highlight a regime in which our simulator achieves substantially superior latency scaling and exponentially superior memory scaling over a tensor network simulator and a state vector simulator. As an efficient and flexible tool for simulating quantum chemistry circuits, our simulator enables new opportunities for enhancing near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry and related domains.</description>

Abstract: In the Stern--Gerlach (SG) apparatus, when the filtering is not perfect, the fermion state transformation is done by non-ideal devices. Such an apparatus is described in quantum mechanics by quantum instruments. It will be shown how the parameters of this instrument can be expressed in terms of some experimentally accessible quantities. These relations are valid both for single and successive measurements. In the latter case, the measuring device is rotated with respect to the first one.</description>

      <title>Hybrid acousto-optical swing-up state control in a quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State transfer between different quantum systems is key for successful quantum technologies. Over long distances, photons are irreplaceable, but on short ranges in miniaturized complex devices or hybrid systems, coupling via orders of magnitude shorter-wavelength acoustic waves has great potential. With interfaces to light, acoustic waves, and more, optically active quantum dots (QDs) are essential for multi-component systems. Here, we propose a hybrid acousto-optical method for non-resonant QD charge state control, extending the recent all-optical swing-up state preparation. We show that exciton and biexciton states, or other superpositions of charge states, can be prepared. Each field can act as a trigger, allowing for the implementation of either an optically gated acoustic control or the opposite scheme, where an optical pulse controls the transition during acoustic modulation. Thus, we introduce acoustic state control into a system that lacks direct acoustic coupling between the states. The method does not rely on pulse shaping and is expected to work with arbitrary pulse shapes as long as the optical dressing is performed quasi-adiabatically. Evaluating the phonon impact, we find an almost decoherence-free exciton preparation even at elevated temperatures with current QD and acoustic technology. This approach may also pave the way for optically controlled entanglement between emitters and acoustic modes, and further on-chip state transfer via quantum acoustic buses.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin van der Pol oscillator -- a spin-based limit-cycle oscillator exhibiting quantum synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin van der Pol (vdP) oscillator as a prototypical model of quantum spinbased limit-cycle oscillators, which coincides with the quantum optical vdP oscillator in the high-spin limit. The system is described as a noisy limit-cycle oscillator in the semiclassical regime at large spin numbers, exhibiting frequency entrainment to a periodic drive. Even in the smallest spin-1 case, mutual synchronization, Arnold tongues, and entanglement tongues in two dissipatively coupled oscillators, and collective synchronization in all-to-all coupled oscillators are clearly observed. The proposed quantum spin vdP oscillator will provide a useful platform for analyzing quantum spin synchronization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical strategy to efficiently solve the out-of-equilibrium Dyson equation in the transient regime. By discretizing the equation into a compact matrix form and applying state-of-the-art matrix compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, which result in quasi-linear scaling of both time and space complexity with propagation time. This enables to compute accurate solutions even for systems with multiple and disparate time scales. We benchmark our solver by simulating a voltage-biased Josephson junction formed by a quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic quantum nature of jets and the Quark-Gluon Plasma makes the study of jet quenching a promising candidate to benefit from quantum computing power. Standing as a precursor of the full study of this phenomenon, we study the propagation of SU(3) partons in Quark-Gluon Plasma using quantum simulation algorithms. The algorithms are developed in detail, and the propagation of both quarks and gluons is analysed and compared with analytical expectations. The results, obtained with quantum simulators, demonstrate that the algorithm successfully simulates parton propagation, yielding results consistent with analytical baseline calculations.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) for generating molecular force fields, focusing on the rMD17 dataset. We consider a QNN architecture based on previous research and point out shortcomings in the parametrization of the atomic environments. These shortcomings limit its expressivity as an interatomic potential and precludes transferability between molecules. We propose a revised QNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings. While both QNNs show promise in force prediction, with the revised architecture showing improved accuracy, they struggle with energy prediction. Further, both QNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing errors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges of scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for improved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new unified structural framework for orbifold sigma models that incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.</description>

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017). While related estimators such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert &amp; Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &amp; Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods, tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results compared to the KernelSHAP library.</description>

      <title>GPa Pressure Imaging Using Nanodiamond Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs). Using a semi-classical approach based on linear stability analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations, we derive a damped Mathieu equation governing parametric instabilities. Our analysis reveals well-separated regions of parametric resonance and Jeans instability in parameter space, with distinct growth rate characteristics: Jeans instability decreases monotonically to zero at the critical wavenumber $k_J$, while parametric resonance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a clear maximum. These findings provide explicit experimental guidelines for accessing the parametric resonance regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate the transition from Faraday wave formation to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases, validating our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical toolkit for the Anderson model in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak, with a profile which is either a pure Gaussian (i) or a Gaussian combined with a periodic modulation (ii).</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Statistical Structure of Charge Disorder in Si/SiGe Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a few principal axes, i.e. there are significant correlations between many properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact Low-Loss Grating Couplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber-to-chip couplers play a crucial role in interfacing on-chip photonic circuits with other optical systems or off-chip devices. Downsizing the couplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density integration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems. However, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level demonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further improvement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design single-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating bottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of couplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of mere 14 $\mu$m $\times$ 14 $\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode fibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the measured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers is -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band. Our demonstration provides a coupling solution for photonic applications requiring high efficiency and high-density integration, such as spatial division multiplexing and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Short-time dynamics in phase-ordering kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>
