      <title>Decreasing paths of polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a continuous path of polygons decreasing if the convex hulls of the polygons form a decreasing family of sets. For an arbitrary polygon of more than three vertices, we characterize the polygons contained in it that can be reached by a decreasing path (attainability problem), and we show that this can be done by a finite application of "pull-in" moves (bang-bang problem). In the case of triangles, this problems was investigated by Goodman, Johansen, Ramsey, and Frydman among others, in connection with the embeddability problem for non-homogeneous Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities, stability results and Kendall's problem in spherical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.06522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Euclidean space, the asymptotic shape of large cells in various types of Poisson driven random tessellations has been the subject of a famous conjecture due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results, relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results for quite general and some specific size and hitting functionals of spherically convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, where the asymptotic regime concerns large size, in the spherical framework the asymptotic analysis is concerned with high intensities.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and dimensions of fractal Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in number theory, analysis, and fractal geometry, we consider regularity properties and dimensions of graphs associated with Fourier series of the form $F(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}/n$, for a large class of coefficient functions $f$. Our main result states that if, for some constants $C$ and $\alpha$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, we have $|\sum_{1\le n\le x}f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}|\le C x^{\alpha}$ uniformly in $x\ge 1$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$, then the series $F(t)$ is H\"older continuous with exponent $1-\alpha$, and the graph of $|F(t)|$ on the interval $[0,1]$ has box-counting dimension $\leq 1+\alpha$. As applications we recover the best-possible uniform H\"older exponents for the Weierstrass functions $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a^k\cos(2\pi b^k t)$ and the Riemann function $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin(\pi n^2 t)/n^2$. Moreoever, under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we obtain nontrivial bounds for H\"older exponents and dimensions associated with series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n)e^{2\pi i n^kt}/n^k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>Multijet bundles and application to the finiteness of moments for zeros of Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of multijet for functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which extends the classical notion of jets in the sense that the multijet of a function is defined by contact conditions at several points. For all $p \geq 1$ we build a vector bundle of $p$-multijets, defined over a well-chosen compactification of the configuration space of $p$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As an application, we prove that the linear statistics associated with the zero set of a centered Gaussian field on a Riemannian manifold have a finite $p$-th moment as soon as the field is of class~$\mathcal{C}^p$ and its $(p-1)$-jet is nowhere degenerate. We prove a similar result for the linear statistics associated with the critical points of a Gaussian field and those associated with the vanishing locus of a holomorphic Gaussian field.</description>

      <title>On manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and integrally-positive $k^{th}$-scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly positive integral lower bounds on the sum of the lowest $k$ eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such curvature bounds for $k=2$, then we show that $M$ is contained in a neighbourhood of controlled width of an isometrically embedded $1$-dimensional sub-manifold. From this, we deduce several metric and topological consequences: $M$ has at most linear volume growth and at most two ends, it has bounded 1-Urysohn width, the first Betti number of $M$ is bounded above by $1$, and there is precise information on elements of infinite order in $\pi_1(M)$.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such bounds for $k\geq 2$ and additionally the Ricci curvature is asymptotically non-negative, then we show that $M$ has at most $(k-1)$-dimensional behavior at large scales.
  If $k=n={\rm dim}(M)$, so that the integral lower bound is on the scalar curvature, assuming in addition that the $(n-2)$-Ricci curvature is asymptotically non-negative, then we prove that the dimension drop at large scales improves to $n-2$.
  From the above results, we deduce topological restrictions, such as upper bounds on the first Betti number.</description>
