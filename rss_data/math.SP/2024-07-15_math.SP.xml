      <title>The moduli space of twisted Laplacians and random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rudnick recently proved that the spectral number variance for the Laplacian of a large compact hyperbolic surface converges, in a certain scaling limit and when averaged with respect to the Weil-Petersson measure on moduli space, to the number variance of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory. In this note we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal symmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This addresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted Laplacians on high genus random covers of a fixed compact surface.</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>The first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a geodesic ball with non-negative Ricci curvature and mean convex boundary, it is known that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of this geodesic ball has a sharp lower bound in term of its radius. We show a quantitative explicit inequality, which bounds the width of geodesic ball in terms of the spectral gap between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the corresponding sharp lower bound.</description>

      <title>A generalized three lines lemma in Hardy-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the following question: given a holomorphic function with prescribed $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^q(\mathbb{R})$ norm (with $1\leq p,q \leq \infty$) along two parallel lines in the complex plane, then what is the maximum value that this function can achieve at a given point between these lines. Here we show that this problem is well-posed in suitable Hardy-like spaces on the strip. Moreover, in this setting we completely solve this problem by providing not only an explicit formula for the optimizers but also for the optimal values. In addition, we briefly discuss some applications of these results to interpolation theory and to Lieb-Thirring inequalities.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Khrushchev-type formulas for structured operators, inequalities and asymptotic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interpolation results in the $S$-nodes theory may be considered as Khrushchev-type formulas. If separation of the well-known Verblunsky (Schur) coefficients occurs in Khrushchev formulas, the separation of the so the called new Verblunsky-type coefficients occurs in the interpolation formulas of the $S$-nodes theory. General asymptotic inequalities (and equalities) for the $S$-nodes, with application to the block Hankel matrices, are derived using this approach. Another asymptotic inequality, needed in the proofs and important in itself, is derived in Appendix B.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Infinitely Smooth Kernel Matrices in the Single Cluster Limit, with Applications to Multivariate Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of infinitely smooth multivariate kernel matrices when the nodes form a single cluster. We show that the geometry of the nodes plays an important role in the scaling of the eigenvalues of these kernel matrices. For the multivariate Dirichlet kernel matrix, we establish a criterion for the sampling set ensuring precise scaling of eigenvalues. Additionally, we identify specific sampling sets that satisfy this criterion. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the problem of super-resolution, i.e. stable recovery of sparse measures from bandlimited Fourier measurements.</description>

      <title>Weighted Poincar\'e inequality and Hardy improvements related to some degenerate elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the sharp constant and maximizing functions for weighted Poincar\'e inequalities. These results lead to refinements of Hardy's inequality obtained by adding remainder terms involving \(L^p\) norms. We use techniques that avoid symmetric rearrangement argument, simplifying the analysis of these inequalities in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean contexts. Specifically, this method applies to a variety of settings, such as the Heisenberg group, various Carnot groups and operators expressed as sums of squares of vector fields. Significant examples include the Heisenberg-Greiner operator and the Baouendi-Grushin operator.</description>

      <title>Rigorous estimation for the difference quotients of multiple eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to rigorously estimate the difference quotient of multiple eigenvalues with respect to domain deformation. This is achieved by deriving a novel difference quotient formula and applying a newly developed guaranteed computation method for eigenvalue problems. Using the proposed algorithm, a computer-assisted proof is provided to validate the simplicity of the second Dirichlet eigenvalue on nearly equilateral triangles. This proof partially solves Conjecture 6.47 in A. Henrot's book ``Shape Optimization and Spectral Theory".</description>

      <title>Uplifting edges in higher order networks: spectral centralities for non-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral analysis of networks states that many structural properties of graphs, such as centrality of their nodes, are given in terms of their adjacency matrices. The natural extension of such spectral analysis to higher order networks is strongly limited by the fact that a given hypergraph could have several different adjacency hypermatrices, hence the results obtained so far are mainly restricted to the class of uniform hypergraphs, which leaves many real systems unattended. A new method for analysing non-linear eigenvector-like centrality measures of non-uniform hypergraphs is presented in this paper that could be useful for studying properties of $\mathcal{H}$-eigenvectors and $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors in the non-uniform case. In order to do so, a new operation - the $\textit{uplift}$ - is introduced, incorporating auxiliary nodes in the hypergraph to allow for a uniform-like analysis. We later argue why this is a mathematically sound operation, and we furthermore use it to classify a whole family of hypergraphs with unique Perron-like $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors. We supplement the theoretical analysis with several examples and numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new upper bounds for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on the spheres of any dimension greater than $2$. As far as we have checked, our results improve previous results found in the literature for all dimensions greater than $2$. We also prove and exhibit an explicit new upper bound for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on $SO(3)$. We also discuss these estimates in the case of general compact Lie groups. Originally developed for estimating the sums of moments of negative eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, these inequalities have applications in quantum mechanics and other fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem (vdCDT) for second countable amenable groups $G$ and the ergodic hierarchy of mixing properties of a unitary representation $U$ of $G$. In particular, we show that one variant of vdCDT corresponds to subrepresentations of the left regular representation, and another variant of vdCDT corresponds to the absence of finite dimensional subrepresentations. We then obtain applications for measure preserving actions of countable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Ballmann, Matthiesen and Mondal [7], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [31].</description>
