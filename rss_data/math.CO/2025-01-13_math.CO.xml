      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <title>Balanced sets and homotopy invariants of covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that any covering of an $m$-dimensional sphere $S^m$ by $n \geq 2$ open (or closed) sets can be associated with a homotopy class of maps from $S^m$ to $S^{n-2}$. We show that by considering certain $n$ points in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, this covering of the sphere $S^m$ can also be associated with a homotopy class of maps from $S^m$ to $S^{d-1}$. In the case $S^m = \partial D^{m+1}$, the resulting homotopy class, when nontrivial, acts as an obstruction to certain extensions of the covering to the entire disk $D^{m+1}$. Using this, we derive the KKMS lemma, as well as its analogues and generalizations. We also show that modulo an automorphism of order 2 on the homotopy group, the homotopy class of the covering does not depend on the choice of the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, provided that these sets are balancedly equivalent.</description>

      <title>On Scarf's theorem for generalized cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a generalization of cooperative games to the case where a coalition can distribute the earned utility not only among its members but also to other players. In particular, we consider an examples where coalitions are required to share their winnings with non-contributing players. For these generalized games, we also provide an analogue of Scarf's theorem. It turns out that in this generalization the existence of a non-empty core is closely related to a homotopy invariants of covers defined by the cooperative game.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Partition of the Hypercube Graph into 3 Initial Segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q_n = \{0, 1\}^n$ be a hypercube graph. The initial segment $I_k \subseteq Q_n$ is the subset consisting of the first $k$ vertices of $Q_n$ in the binary order. A pair of integers $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}^2$ is said to be fit if, whenever $2^n \geq a+b$, there exists $g_1, g_2 \in \text{Aut}(Q_n)$ such that $g_1(I_a) \cup g_2(I_b) = I_{a+b}$, and $(a,b)$ is unfit otherwise. For $a + b + c = 2^n$, there is a partition of $Q_n$ into $3$ initial segments of length $a, b$, and $c$ if and only if $(a, b)$ is a fit pair. Thus, the notion of fit and unfit pairs is closely related to the graph-partition problem for hypercube graphs. This paper introduces a new criterion in determining whether $(a,b)$ is fit using an easy-to-compute point-counting function and applies this criterion to generate the set of all unfit pairs. It further shows that the number of unfit pairs $(a,b)$, where $0 &lt; a,b \leq 2^n$, is $4^n - \binom{4}{1}3^n + \binom{4}{2} 2^n - \binom{4}{1}$, which is also the number of surjection of an $n$-element set to a $4$-element set.</description>

      <title>Graphs with Independent Exact $r$-covers for all $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every natural number $d$, we construct finite $d$-regular simple graphs that, for every $r \le d$, contain an independent exact $r$-cover. This answers a question of Gray and Johnson that arose in their study of 2-step transit probabilities.
  We obtain some divisibility conditions on the order $n$ of graphs that for every $r \le d$ contain an independent exact $r$-cover, and give constructions for $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ where the order of the graph is minimal (we deduce this minimality from our divisibility conditions). We construct these graphs as common coverings of smaller graphs. We revisit a result of Angluin and Gardiner on finite common coverings of two regular graphs of the same degree, and the result of Gross that regular graphs of even degree are Schreier coset graphs. We combine both results to provide a finite common covering of two regular graphs of the same degree, that uses fewer vertices than the construction of Angluin and Gardiner in some cases.</description>

      <title>2-extendability of (4,5,6)-fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (4,5,6)-fullerene is a plane cubic graph whose faces are only quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons, which includes all (4,6)- and (5,6)-fullerenes. A connected graph $G$ with at least $2k+2$ vertices is $k$-extendable if $G$ has perfect matchings and any matching of size $k$ is contained in a perfect matching of $G$. We know that each (4,5,6)-fullerene graph is 1-extendable and at most 2-extendable. It is natural to wonder which (4,5,6)-fullerene graphs are 2-extendable. In this paper, we completely solve this problem (see Theorem 3.3): All non-2-extendable (4,5,6)-fullerenes consist of four sporadic (4,5,6)-fullerenes ($F_{12},F_{14},F_{18}$ and $F_{20}$) and five classes of (4,5,6)-fullerenes. As a surprising consequence, we find that all (4,5,6)-fullerenes with the anti-Kekul\'{e} number 3 are non-2-extendable. Further, there also always exists a non-2-extendable (4,5,6)-fullerene with arbitrarily even $n\geqslant10$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Oriented discrepancy of Hamilton cycles and paths in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd{\H o}s (1963) initiated extensive graph discrepancy research on 2-edge-colored graphs. Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli (2023) launched similar research on oriented graphs. They conjectured the following generalization of Dirac's theorem: If the minimum degree $\delta$ of an $n$-vertex oriented graph $G$ is greater or equal to $n/2$,then $G$ has a Hamilton oriented cycle with at least $\delta$ forward arcs. This conjecture was proved by Freschi and Lo (2024) who posed an open problem to extend their result to an Ore-type condition. We propose two conjectures for such extensions and prove some results which provide support to the conjectures. For forward arc maximization on Hamilton oriented cycles and paths in semicomplete multipartite digraphs and locally semicomplete digraphs, we obtain characterizations which lead to polynomial-time algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Colored Tilings on Graphs via Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of partitioning a graph into connected and colored components called blocks. Using bivariate generating functions and combinatorial techniques, we determine the expected number of blocks when the vertices of a graph $G$, for $G$ in certain families of graphs, are colored uniformly and independently. Special emphasis is placed on graphs of the form $G \times P_n$, where $P_n$ is the path graph on $n$ vertices. This case serves as a generalization of the problem of enumerating the number of tilings of an $m \times n$ grid using colored polyominoes.</description>

      <title>Refined Brill-Noether Theory for Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divisor theory of the complete graph $K_n$ is in many ways similar to that of a plane curve of degree $n$. We compute the splitting types of all divisors on the complete graph $K_n$. We see that the possible splitting types of divisors on $K_n$ exactly match the possible splitting types of line bundles on a smooth plane curve of degree $n$. This generalizes the earlier result of Cori and Le Borgne computing the ranks of all divisors on $K_n$, and the earlier work of Cools and Panizzut analyzing the possible ranks of divisors of fixed degree on $K_n$.</description>

      <title>A Direct Proof of the Short-Side Advantage in Random Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stable matching problem under the random matching model where the preferences of the doctors and hospitals are sampled uniformly and independently at random. In a balanced market with $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm gives doctors an expected rank of order $\log n$ for their partners and hospitals an expected rank of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for their partners. This situation is reversed in an unbalanced market with $n+1$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, a phenomenon known as the short-side advantage. The current proofs of this fact are indirect, counter-intuitively being based upon analyzing the hospital-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. In this paper we provide a direct proof of the short-side advantage, explicitly analyzing the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. Our proof sheds light on how and why the phenomenon arises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n_q(M,d)$ be the minimum length of a $q$-ary code of size $M$ and minimum distance $d$. Bounding $n_q(M,d)$ is a fundamental problem that lies at the heart of coding theory. This work considers a generalization $n^\bx_q(M,d)$ of $n_q(M,d)$ corresponding to codes in which codewords have \emph{protected} and \emph{unprotected} entries; where (analogs of) distance and of length are measured with respect to protected entries only. Such codes, here referred to as \emph{box codes}, have seen prior studies in the context of bipartite graph covering. Upper and lower bounds on $n^\bx_q(M,d)$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of walks in multidimensional orthants and reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (random) walks in a multidimensional orthant. Using the idea of universality in probability theory, one can associate a unique polyhedral domain to any given walk model. We use this connection to prove two sets of new results. First, we are interested in a group of transformations naturally associated with any small step model; as it turns out, this group is central to the classification of walk models. We show a strong connection between this group and the reflection group through the walls of the polyhedral domain. As a consequence, we can derive various conditions for the combinatorial group to be infinite. Secondly, we consider the asymptotics of the number of excursions, whose critical exponent is known to be computable in terms of the eigenvalue of the above polyhedral domain. We prove new results from spectral theory on the eigenvalues of polyhedral nodal domains. We believe that these results are interesting in their own right; they can also be used to find new exact asymptotic results for walk models corresponding to these nodal polyhedral domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of degenerate versions of certain special polynomials and numbers, which was initiated by Carlitz's work on degenerate Euler and degenerate Bernoulli polynomials, has recently seen renewed interest among mathematicians. The aim of this paper is to study some properties, certain identities, recurrence relations and explicit expressions for degenerate Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are a degenerate version of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. These numbers appear very frequently when we study various degenerate versions of many special polynomials and numbers. Especially, we consider some closely related polynomials and power series in connection with a degenerate version of Euler's formula for the Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <title>SAGBI bases of subalgebras arising from finite distributive lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of SAGBI bases was introduced as an analogue of Gr\"{o}bner bases in the context of subalgebras. A Hibi ideal is an ideal of a polynomial ring that arises from a distributive lattice. For the development of an analogy of the theory of Hibi ideals and Gr\"{o}bner bases within the framework of subalgebras, in this paper, we investigate when the set of the polynomials associated with a distributive lattice forms a SAGBI basis of the subalgebras it generates. We characterize such distributive lattices and their underlying posets. In particular, generalized snake posets and $\{(2+2),(1+1+1)\}$-free posets appear as the characterization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empty buses are standing at a bus station. $n$ passengers arrive, and they each board a bus completely at random (meaning that they choose uniformly and independently). Then all buses depart. We show that the more buses there are, the more likely it is that someone (i.e. at least one passenger) travels alone (while $n$ is fixed). More generally, we show that the number of lonely passengers increases with the number of buses, in the sense of stochastic dominance. This problem turned out to be surprisingly difficult, with no short solution known to the author so far, despite the efforts of many experts. Some of the results can also be formulated as properties of Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the theory of JT supergravity, Stanford-Witten derived a remarkable recursion formula of Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli space of super Riemann surfaces. It is the super version of the celebrated Mirzakhani's recursion formula. In this paper, we generalize Stanford-Witten's formula to include high degree kappa classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear recurrences we consider here include the functions $3x(1-x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which possess attractive fixed points $2/3$ and $0.739...$ (Dottie's number). Detailed asymptotics for oscillatory convergence are found, starting with a 1960 paper by Wolfgang Thron. Another function, $x/(1+x\ln(1+x))$, gives rise to a sequence with monotonic convergence to $0$ but requires substantial work to calculate its associated constant $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.07494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gluing of two rooted trees is an identification of their leaves and un-subdivision of the resulting 2-valent vertices. A gluing of two rooted trees is subdivergence free if it has no 2-edge cuts with both roots on the same side of the cut. The problem and language is motivated by quantum field theory. We enumerate subdivergence-free gluings for certain families of trees, showing a connection with connected permutations, and we give algorithms to compute subdivergence-free gluings.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of determining the probability of triangle count deviations in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n,m)$ and $G(n,p)$ with densities larger than $n^{-1/2}(\log{n})^{1/2}$. In particular, we determine the log probability $\log\mathbb{P}(N_{\triangle}(G)\, &gt;\, (1+\delta)p^3n^3)$ up to a constant factor across essentially the entire range of possible deviations, in both the $G(n,m)$ and $G(n,p)$ model. For the $G(n,p)$ model we also prove a stronger result, up to a $(1+o(1))$ factor, in the non-localised regime. We also obtain some results for the lower tail and for counts of cherries (paths of length $2$).</description>

      <title>Sumsets with a minimum number of distinct terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a set $A$ of $k$ elements from an additive abelian group $G$ and a positive integer $r \leq k$, we consider the set of elements of $G$ that can be written as a sum of $h$ elements of $A$ with at least $r$ distinct elements. We denote this set by $h^{(\geq r)}A$. The set $h^{(\geq r)}A$ generalizes the classical sumsets $hA$ and $h\hat{}A$ for $r=1$ and $r=h$, respectively. As the main result of this article, we give an upper bound for the minimum size of $h^{(\geq r)}A$ over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ for $m \geq 2$. Further, by an observation relating the sumsets $hA$, $h\hat{}A$, and $h^{(\geq r)}A$ we obtain the sharp lower bound on the size of $h^{(\geq r)}A$ and also characterize the set $A$ for which the lower bound on the size of $h^{(\geq r)}A$ is tight over the groups $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is a prime number.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for estimating the crossing number of dense graphs, and continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deterministic $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithm that approximates the crossing number of any graph $G$ of order $n$ up to an additive error of $o(n^4)$. We also provide a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that constructs a drawing of $G$ with $\text{cr}(G)+o(n^4)$ crossings. These results yield a $1+o(1)$ approximation algorithm for the crossing number of dense graphs. Our work complements a paper of Fox, Pach and S\'uk, who obtained similar results for the rectilinear crossing number.
  The results of Fox, Pach and S\'uk and in this paper imply that the (normalized) crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers are estimable parameters. Motivated by this, we introduce two graphon parameters, the \textit{crossing density} and the \textit{rectilinear crossing density}, and we prove that, in a precise sense, these are the correct continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the rectilinear crossing number of complete balanced multipartite graphs and layered graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rectilinear drawing of a graph is a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. The rectilinear crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross over all rectilinear drawings of the graph. Let $n \ge r$ be positive integers. The graph $K_n^r$, is the complete $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which every set of the partition has at least $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ vertices. The layered graph, $L_n^r$, is an $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which for every $1\le i \le r-1$, all the vertices in the $i$-th partition are adjacent to all the vertices in the $(i+1)$-th partition. In this paper, we give upper bounds on the rectilinear crossing numbers of $K_n^r$ and~$L_n^r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An induced packing of cycles in a graph is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles with no edges between them. We generalise the classic Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa theorem to induced packings of cycles. More specifically, we show that there exist functions $f(k,\ell)=\mathcal{O}(\ell k\log k)$ and $g(k)=\mathcal{O}(k\log k)$ such that for all integers $k\geq1$ and $\ell\geq3$, every graph $G$ contains either an induced packing of $k$ cycles of length at least $\ell$, not necessarily induced cycles, or sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ of vertices with $|X_1|\leq f(k,\ell)$ and $|X_2|\leq g(k)$ such that, after removing the closed neighbourhood of $X_1$ or the ball of radius $\ell$ around $X_2$, the resulting graph has no cycle of length at least $\ell$ in $G$. Our proof is constructive and yields a polynomial-time algorithm finding either the induced packing or the sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ when $\ell$ is a constant. Furthermore, we show that for every positive integer $d$, if a graph $G$ does not contain two cycles at distance more than $d$, then $G$ contains sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ of vertices with $|X_1|\leq12(d+1)$ and $|X_2|\leq12$ such that, after removing the ball of radius $2d$ around $X_1$ or the ball of radius $3d$ around $X_2$, the resulting graphs are forests.
  As a corollary, we prove that every graph with no $K_{1,t}$ induced subgraph and no induced packing of $k$ cycles of length at least $\ell$ has tree-independence number at most $\mathcal{O}(t\ell k\log k)$, and one can construct a corresponding tree-decomposition in polynomial time when $\ell$ is a constant. This resolves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard et al. (arXiv:2402.11222), and implies that on such graphs, many NP-hard problems, are solvable in polynomial time. On the other hand, we show that the class of all graphs with no $K_{1,3}$ induced subgraph and no two cycles at distance more than $2$ has unbounded tree-independence number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i &lt; 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k &gt; 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</description>

      <title>Transforming Stacks into Queues: Mixed and Separated Layouts of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the most important open problems for linear layouts of graphs ask for the relation between a graph's queue number and its stack number or mixed number. In such, we seek a vertex order and edge partition of $G$ into parts with pairwise non-crossing edges (a stack) or with pairwise non-nesting edges (a queue). Allowing only stacks, only queues, or both, the minimum number of required parts is the graph's stack number $sn(G)$, queue number $qn(G)$, and mixed number $mn(G)$, respectively.
  Already in 1992, Heath and Rosenberg asked whether $qn(G)$ is bounded in terms of $sn(G)$, that is, whether stacks "can be transformed into" queues. This is equivalent to bipartite $3$-stack graphs having bounded queue number (Dujmovi\'c and Wood, 2005). Recently, Alam et al. asked whether $qn(G)$ is bounded in terms of $mn(G)$, which we show to also be equivalent to the previous questions.
  We approach the problem by considering separated linear layouts of bipartite graphs. In this natural setting all vertices of one part must precede all vertices of the other part. Separated stack and queue numbers coincide, and for fixed vertex orders, graphs with bounded separated stack/queue number can be characterized and efficiently recognized, whereas the separated mixed layouts are more challenging. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the relationship between separated and non-separated, mixed and pure linear layouts.</description>

      <title>Matchings in matroids over abelian groups, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of matchings originated in group theory to address a linear algebra problem related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors. In an abelian group $(G,+)$, a matching is a bijection $f: A \to B$ between two finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ such that $a + f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. A group $G$ has the matching property if, for every two finite subsets $A, B \subset G$ of the same size with $0 \notin B$, there exists a matching from $A$ to $B$. In prior work \cite{Zerbib 0}, matroid analogues of results concerning matchings in groups were introduced and established. This paper serves as a sequel, extending that line of inquiry by investigating paving, panhandle, and Schubert matroids through the lens of matchability. While some proofs draw upon earlier findings on the matchability of sparse paving matroids, the paper is designed to be self-contained and accessible without reference to the preceding sequel. Our approach combines tools from both matroid theory and additive number theory.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the study of the minimal excludant in integer partitions by G.E. Andrews and D. Newman, we introduce a pair of new partition statistics, squrank and recrank. It is related to a polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums for an integrable cellular automaton. For all nonnegative integer $n$, we prove that the partitions of $n$ on which squrank or recrank takes on a particular value, say $r$, are equinumerous with the partitions of $n$ on which the odd/even minimal exclutant takes on the corresponding value, $2r+1$ or $2r+2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a randomized $\tilde{O}(\mu(G))$-round algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching problem in the CONGEST model, where $\mu(G)$ means the maximum size of a matching of the input graph $G$. The proposed algorithm substantially improves the current best worst-case running time. The key technical ingredient is a new randomized algorithm of finding an augmenting path of length $\ell$ with high probability within $\tilde{O}(\ell)$ rounds, which positively settles an open problem left in the prior work by Ahmadi and Kuhn [DISC'20].
  The idea of our augmenting path algorithm is based on a recent result by Kitamura and Izumi [IEICE Trans.'22], which efficiently identifies a sparse substructure of the input graph containing an augmenting path, following a new concept called \emph{alternating base trees}. Their algorithm, however, resorts in part to a centralized approach of collecting the entire information of the substructure into a single vertex for constructing a long augmenting path. The technical highlight of this paper is to provide a fully-decentralized counterpart of such a centralized method. To develop the algorithm, we prove several new structural properties of alternating base trees, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Additively stable sets, critical sets for the 3k-4 theorem in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe in this paper additively left stable sets, i.e. sets satisfying $\left((A+A)-\inf(A)\right)\cap[\inf(A),\sup(A)]=A$ (meaning that $A-\inf(A)$ is stable by addition with itself on its convex hull), when $A$ is a finite subset of integers and when $A$ is a bounded subset of real numbers. More precisely we give a sharp upper bound for the density of $A$ in $[\inf(A),x]$ for $x\le\sup(A)$, and construct sets reaching this density for any given $x$ in this range. This gives some information on sets involved in the structural description of some critical sets in Freiman's $3k-4$ theorem in both cases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic computations of tropical refined invariants in genus 0 and 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block and G\"ottsche introduced a Laurent polynomial multiplicity to count tropical curves. Itenberg and Mikhalkin then showed that this multiplicity leads to invariant counts called tropical refined invariants. Recently, Brugall\'e and Jaramillo-Puentes studied the polynomiality properties of the coefficients of these invariants and showed that for fixed genus g, the coefficients ultimately coincide with polynomials in the homology class of the curves we look at. We call the generating series of these polynomials asymptotic refined invariant. In genus 0, the asymptotic refined invariant has been computed by the second author in the h-transverse case.
  In this paper, we give a new proof of the formula for the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 0 using variations on the floor diagram algorithm. This technique allows also to compute the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 1. The result exhibits surprising regularity properties related to the generating series of partition numbers and quasi-modular forms.</description>

      <title>When are quarnets sufficient to reconstruct semi-directed phylogenetic networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are graphs that are used to represent evolutionary relationships between different taxa. They generalize phylogenetic trees since for example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has been rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed edges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One reason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network using real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed phylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it induces on the 4-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are called quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-2 phylogenetic networks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for level-3. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed binary network, a tree that give the coarse-grained structure of the network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network. These results are relevant for proving the statistical consistency of programs that are currently being developed for reconstructing phylogenetic networks from practical data, such as the recently developed Squirrel software tool.</description>

      <title>A topological proof of the Hell-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of a theorem of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il [J. Comb. Theory B, 48(1):92-110, 1990] using tools from topological combinatorics based on ideas of Lov\'asz [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 25(3):319-324, 1978]. The Hell-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il Theorem provides a dichotomy of the graph homomorphism problem. It states that deciding whether there is a graph homomorphism from a given graph to a fixed graph $H$ is in P if $H$ is bipartite (or contains a self-loop), and is NP-complete otherwise. In our proof we combine topological combinatorics with the algebraic approach to constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Genus Algorithm Based on Graph Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a simple finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n(4^m/n)^{n/t})$ steps where $t$ is the girth. This algorithm avoids the difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of properties that make it useful for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of the optimal embedding, it outputs a proof certificate for verification and it can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>
