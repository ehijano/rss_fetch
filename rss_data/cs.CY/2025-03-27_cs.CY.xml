      <title>AI Identity, Empowerment, and Mindfulness in Mitigating Unethical AI Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how AI identity influences psychological empowerment and unethical AI behavior among college students, while also exploring the moderating role of IT mindfulness. Findings show that a strong AI identity enhances psychological empowerment and academic engagement but can also lead to increased unethical AI practices. Crucially, IT mindfulness acts as an ethical safeguard, promoting sensitivity to ethical concerns and reducing misuse of AI. These insights have implications for educators, policymakers, and AI developers, emphasizing For Peer Review the need for a balanced approach that encourages digital engagement without compromising student responsibility. The study also contributes to philosophical discussions of psychological agency, suggesting that empowerment through AI can yield both positive and negative outcomes. Mindfulness emerges as essential in guiding ethical AI interactions. Overall, the research informs ongoing debates on ethics in education and AI, offering strategies to align technological advancement with ethical accountability and responsible use.</description>

      <title>Role of AI Innovation, Clean Energy and Digital Economy towards Net Zero Emission in the United States: An ARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current paper investigates the influences of AI innovation, GDP growth, renewable energy utilization, the digital economy, and industrialization on CO2 emissions in the USA from 1990 to 2022, incorporating the ARDL methodology. The outcomes observe that AI innovation, renewable energy usage, and the digital economy reduce CO2 emissions, while GDP expansion and industrialization intensify ecosystem damage. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) reveal heterogeneous integration levels amongst components, ensuring robustness in the ARDL analysis. Complementary methods (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR) validate the results, enhancing their reliability. Pairwise Granger causality assessments identify strong unidirectional connections within CO2 emissions and AI innovation, as well as the digital economy, underscoring their significant roles in ecological sustainability. This research highlights the requirement for strategic actions to nurture equitable growth, including advancements in AI technology, green energy adoption, and environmentally conscious industrial development, to improve environmental quality in the United States.</description>

      <title>What is the role of human decisions in a world of artificial intelligence: an economic evaluation of human-AI collaboration in diabetic retinopathy screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into the medical field, the role of humans may become vague. While numerous studies highlight AI's potential, how humans and AI collaborate to maximize the combined clinical benefits remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze 270 screening scenarios from a health-economic perspective in a national diabetic retinopathy screening program, involving eight human-AI collaborative strategies and traditional manual screening. We find that annual copilot human-AI screening in the 20-79 age group, with referral decisions made when both humans and AI agree, is the most cost-effective strategy for human-AI collaboration. The 'copilot' strategy brings health benefits equivalent to USD 4.64 million per 100,000 population compared to manual screening. These findings demonstrate that even in settings where AI is highly mature and efficient, human involvement remains essential to ensuring both health and economic benefits. Our findings highlight the need to optimize human-AI collaboration strategies for AI implementation into healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a Generative AI Assistant in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI (GenAI) assistant tool that aims to provide feedback on writing K-12 contexts. The aim was to use GenAI to provide formative and summative feedback on students' texts in English Language Arts (ELA), Social Studies, and Modern World History. The trials discussed in this paper involved Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 and were conducted in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. The tool used two main mechanisms: "prompt engineering" based on participant teachers' assessment rubric and "fine-tuning" a Large Language Model (LLM) from a customized corpus of teaching materials using Retrieval Augmented Generation. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to enhance students' writing abilities and support teachers in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments.</description>

      <title>Three Kinds of AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an overwhelming abundance of works in AI Ethics. This growth is chaotic because of how sudden it is, its volume, and its multidisciplinary nature. This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically characterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI ethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can be characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three well-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI. I elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their research questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I also show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from the point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different goals. All in all, this work sheds light on the nature of AI ethics, and sets the groundwork for more informed discussions about the scope, methods, and training of AI ethicists.</description>

      <title>Threshold Crossings as Tail Events for Catastrophic AI Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse circumstances in which bifurcation-driven jumps in AI systems are associated with emergent heavy-tailed outcome distributions. By analysing how a control parameter's random fluctuations near a catastrophic threshold generate extreme outcomes, we demonstrate in what circumstances the probability of a sudden, large-scale, transition aligns closely with the tail probability of the resulting damage distribution. Our results contribute to research in monitoring, mitigation and control of AI systems when seeking to manage potentially catastrophic AI risk.</description>

      <title>Networking Systems for Video Anomaly Detection: A Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD. Lastly, this article projects future development trends and discusses how the integration of AI and computing technologies can address existing research challenges and promote open opportunities, serving as an insightful guide for prospective researchers and engineers.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Copyrighted Beasts and How (Not) to Generate Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that image and video generation models can be prompted to reproduce copyrighted content from their training data, raising serious legal concerns about copyright infringement. Copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario, Batman) present a significant challenge: at least one lawsuit has already awarded damages based on the generation of such characters. Consequently, commercial services like DALL-E have started deploying interventions. However, little research has systematically examined these problems: (1) Can users easily prompt models to generate copyrighted characters, even if it is unintentional?; (2) How effective are the existing mitigation strategies? To address these questions, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with metrics that assess both the generated image's similarity to copyrighted characters and its consistency with user intent, grounded in a set of popular copyrighted characters from diverse studios and regions. We show that state-of-the-art image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with "videogame, plumber" consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). We also introduce semi-automatic techniques to identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Using this framework, we evaluate mitigation strategies, including prompt rewriting and new approaches we propose. Our findings reveal that common methods, such as DALL-E's prompt rewriting, are insufficient alone and require supplementary strategies like negative prompting. Our work provides empirical grounding for discussions on copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers implementing these safeguards.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and Progressive Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature and an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project. From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets' before the financial crisis. We thus identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The frst focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called "Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu"-Theorems. The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in what could be called "The Dynamical Systems approach to Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics", and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations. We conclude by discussing in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising. The focus lies on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and we discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed. In an outlook, we discuss the role of (ecological) data, and the need for what we call Progressive Data Science.</description>

      <title>ICLR Points: How Many ICLR Publications Is One Paper in Each Area?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific publications significantly impact academic-related decisions in computer science, where top-tier conferences are particularly influential. However, efforts required to produce a publication differ drastically across various subfields. While existing citation-based studies compare venues within areas, cross-area comparisons remain challenging due to differing publication volumes and citation practices.
  To address this gap, we introduce the concept of ICLR points, defined as the average effort required to produce one publication at top-tier machine learning conferences such as ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS. Leveraging comprehensive publication data from DBLP (2019--2023) and faculty information from CSRankings, we quantitatively measure and compare the average publication effort across 27 computer science sub-areas. Our analysis reveals significant differences in average publication effort, validating anecdotal perceptions: systems conferences generally require more effort per publication than AI conferences.
  We further demonstrate the utility of the ICLR points metric by evaluating publication records of universities, current faculties and recent faculty candidates. Our findings highlight how using this metric enables more meaningful cross-area comparisons in academic evaluation processes. Lastly, we discuss the metric's limitations and caution against its misuse, emphasizing the necessity of holistic assessment criteria beyond publication metrics alone.</description>
