      <title>Event activity correlations and jet measurements in p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the STAR experiment at RHIC, we characterize $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $p$+Au collisions by event activity (EA) measured within the pseudorapidity range $\eta\in[-5,-3.4]$ in the Au-going direction and report correlations between this EA and hard- and soft-scale particle production at mid-rapidity ($\eta\in[-1,1]$). At the soft scale, charged particle production in low-EA $p$+Au collisions is comparable to that in \pp collisions and increases monotonically with increasing EA. At the hard scale, we report measurements of high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) jets in events of different EAs. In contrast to the soft particle production, high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particle production and EA are found to be inversely related. To investigate whether this is a signal of jet quenching in high-EA events, we also report ratios of $p_\mathrm{T}$ imbalance and azimuthal separation of dijets in high- and low-EA events. Within our measurement precision, no significant differences are observed, disfavoring the presence of jet quenching in the highest 30% EA $p$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influence of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated by Skyrme density functionals theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L=42.57$-$50.64$ MeV, namely the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement of multinucleons: experimental prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiprotons and multineutrons are among the most exotic and mysterious things ever produced on earth. They provide an exceptional opportunity to understand nuclear forces and nuclear dynamics at extreme conditions, as well as neutron stars in the heaven. Quantum entanglement, referred to as ``spooky action at a distance'' by Einstein, is a ubiquitous yet deep property of quantum systems. It not only occupies a central position in quantum information science but also is investigated intensively in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. In comparison, the study of nuclear entanglement is still in infancy, and the entanglement properties of multiprotons and multineutrons in free space are generally unknown. Here, we study the crucial problem of how to measure spin entanglement of these multinucleons in nuclear experiments, with special emphases on two- and three-nucleon states. These findings open a freshly new direction for the multinucleon research. They are also useful for understanding entanglement properties of other exotic nuclear objects.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and nonrelativistic energy-density functionals for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from direct charm production or decay of excited open charm states, and the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass ($M_{\pi K}$) through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time ($t_{z}$), pseudoproper decay length ($c\tau$), and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

      <title>Charmonium Transport in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an update on our semi-classical transport approach for quarkonium production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, focusing on $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons in 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at both forward and mid-rapidity. In particular, we employ the most recent charm-production cross sections reported in pp collisions, which are pivotal for the magnitude of the regeneration contribution, and their modifications due to cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects. Multi-differential observables are calculated in terms of nuclear modification factors as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity, including the contributions from bottom-decay feeddown. For our predictions for $\psi(2S)$ production, the mechanism of sequential regeneration relative to the more strongly bound $J/\psi$ meson plays an important role in interpreting recent ALICE data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of magnetized quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong transient magnetic fields are generated in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These fields induce anisotropy within the strongly interacting medium that, in principle, can affect the thermodynamic properties of the medium. We use the Polyakov loop extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio model to study the quark matter subjected to an external magnetic field at vanishing baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$). We have estimated the degree of anisotropy in the speed of sound and isothermal compressibility within the magnetized quark matter as a function of temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($eB$). This study helps us to understand the extent of directionality generated in the initial stages of non-central collisions while giving us useful information about the system.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align}
with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>
