      <title>Equivalent boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field on the surface of a periodic grating of resistive strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is aimed at formulating equivalent boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field on the surface of a periodic grating of resistive strips valid for arbitrary incident fields. It is assumed that the period of the grating is much smaller than the wavelength. We obtain two-sided boundary conditions of impedance type that allow one to replace any flat grating of resistive strips with a plane of discontinuity of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation at low rotation frequencies using an on-axis magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation by rotation is a simply yet astonishing phenomenon where a permanent magnet can be levitated by placing it in the vicinity of another permanent magnet that rotates sufficiently fast. The few previous works on this novel type of magnetic levitation all required magnets rotating on the order of 200 Hz. Here we investigate the influence of applying an on-axis, static magnetic field and show that this can lower the needed rotation frequency to below 50 Hz. We explain this by a detailed analysis of the force producing levitation, which is a superposition of a repelling force caused by the off-axis (rotating) magnetic field and an attractive force due to the on-axis field. We study this force and resulting levitation experimentally, analytically and numerically for three different rotor magnet configurations, showing that the levitation distance and frequency range can be accurately predicted from both the numerical and analytical models.</description>

      <title>Oscillation threshold of a Raman clarinet with localized nonlinear losses at the open end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized nonlinear losses are taken into account in a simple Raman clarinet model.The complete system is expressed as an iterated map, enabling to study the stability of the different playing regimes. A parametric study is carried out with respect to three major parameters: blowing pressure, embouchure and nonlinear losses coefficient.The model exhibits the well-known effect of reducing the maximum blowing pressure until the oscillations stop (extinction threshold) when nonlinear losses increase.Furthermore, the stability analysis also shows that increasing nonlinear losses increases the minimal blowing pressure for which the oscillations start (oscillation threshold).</description>

      <title>General solution to Euler-Poisson equations of a free symmetric body by direct summation of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler-Poisson equations describe the temporal evolution of a rigid body's orientation through the rotation matrix and angular velocity components, governed by first-order differential equations. According to the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, these equations can be solved by expressing their solutions as power series in the evolution parameter. In this work, we derive the sum of these series for the case of a free symmetric rigid body. By using the integrals of motion and directly summing the terms of these series, we obtain the general solution to the Euler-Poisson equations for a free symmetric body in terms of elementary functions. This method circumvents the need for standard parametrizations like Euler angles, allowing for a direct, closed-form solution. The results are consistent with previous studies, offering a new perspective on solving the Euler-Poisson equations.</description>
