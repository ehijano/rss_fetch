      <title>Ludwig Bieberbach's "Remarks on Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem" and Addendum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an English translation of Ludwig Bieberbach's paper ``Remarks on Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem" originally written in German and originally published in Journal f\"ur die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik - 165 (89-92) 1931, along with an addendum to the paper published in 1933. Beiberbach studies under what conditions are there functions of three variables which can or cannot be obtained by combining or nesting functions of two variables. In the addendum, Bieberbach acknowledges a fatal error in a proof in the original article and connects Hilbert's thirteenth problem to a related problem in the theory of differential equations.</description>

      <title>If parallel lines could meet: What exactly can a poet say about the Fano plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes our invention of a new poetic form based on projective geometry. In doing this we also explore the 'what ifs' in mathematics and poetry which spark the creative processes of poet and mathematician. In other words, throughout our collaboration we often asked one another, is this what it's like for you? Do you think in this way, too? How does your experience of creativity compare to mine? And often, as well, what exactly do you mean when you say...? We spent a fair amount of time and energy, for example, trying to understand one another's interpretation of 'a line'. This collaboration resulted in three poems in the new projective plane form. We also consider what might be interesting avenues for future research, such as the incorporation of octonions in poetic form.</description>

      <title>How Much String to String a Cardioid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A residue design is an artistic geometric construction in which we have $n$ equally-spaced points on a circle numbered 0 through $n-1$ and we join with a line segment each point $k$ to $ak$ modulo $n$ for some fixed $a\ge 2.$ The envelopes of these lines are epicycloids, like cardioids. In this note, we prove that the sum of the lengths of these line segments has a surprisingly simple closed form. In particular, if one wants to make one of these designs with string, it is easy to calculate how much string is required.</description>
