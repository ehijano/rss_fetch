      <title>On the biautomaticity of CAT(0) triangle-square groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the research from the paper ``Triangles, squares and geodesics'' (arXiv:0910.5688) of Rena Levitt and Jon McCammond we investigate the properties of groups acting on CAT(0) triangle-square complexes, focusing mostly on biautomaticity of such groups. In particular we show two examples of nonpositively curved triangle-square complexes $X_1$ and $X_2$, such that their universal covers violate conjectures given in the aforementioned paper. This shows that the Gersten-Short geodesics cannot be used as a way of proving biautomaticity of groups acting on such complexes. Lastly we give a proof of biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_1)$, however the biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_2)$ remains unknown.</description>

      <title>On biprimitive semisymmetric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular bipartite graph $\Gamma$ is called semisymmetric if its full automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts transitively on the edge set but not on the vertex set. For a subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ that stabilizes the biparts of $\Gamma$, we say that $\Gamma$ is $G$-biprimitive if $G$ acts primitively on each part. In this paper, we first provide a method to construct infinite families of biprimitive semisymmetric graphs admitting almost simple groups. With the aid of this result, a classification of $G$-biprimitive semisymmetric graphs is obtained for $G=\mathrm{A}_n$ or $\mathrm{S}_n$. In pursuit of this goal, we determine all pairs of maximal subgroups of $\mathrm{A}_n$ or $\mathrm{S}_n$ with the same order and all pairs of almost simple groups of the same order.</description>

      <title>Finite semiprimitive permutation groups of rank $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transitive permutation group is said to be semiprimitive if each of its normal subgroups is either semiregular or transitive.The class of semiprimitive groups properly contains primitive groups, quasiprimitive groups and innately transitive groups.The latter three classes of groups of rank $3$ have been classified, forming significant progresses on the long-standing problem of classifying permutation groups of rank $3$.In this paper, a complete classification is given of finite semiprimitive groups of rank $3$ that are not innately transitive, examples of which are certain Schur coverings of certain almost simple $2$-transitive groups, and three exceptional small groups.</description>

      <title>The word problem of finitely presented special inverse monoids via their groups of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A special inverse monoid is one defined by a presentation where all the defining relations have the form $r = 1$. By a result of Ivanov Margolis and Meakin the word problem for such an inverse monoid can often be reduced to the word problem in its maximal group image together with membership in a particular submonoid of that group, called the prefix monoid, being decidable. We prove several results that give sufficient conditions for the prefix membership problem of a finitely presented group to be decidable. These conditions are given in terms of the existence of particular factorisations of the relator words. In particular we are able to find sufficient conditions for a special inverse monoid, its maximal group image and its group of units to have word problems that are algorithmically equivalent. These results extend previous results for one-relator groups to arbitrary finitely presented groups. We then apply these results to solve the word problem in various families of E-unitary special inverse monoids. We also find some criteria for when amalgamations of E-unitary inverse monoids are themselves E-unitary.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. The questions answered here have been considered before for FPP on euclidean lattices, but have only been satisfactorily answered for planar exactly solvable models of last passage percolation. Our results exhibit new features in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the complexity of solving quadratic equations in the lamplighter group. We give a complete classification of cases (depending on genus and other characteristics of a given equation) when the problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete or polynomial-time decidable. We notice that the conjugacy problem can be solved in linear time. Finally, we prove that the problem belongs to the class $\mathbf{XP}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\nil$ be the class of nilpotent groups.

      <title>Transitive fusion systems over a class of finite p-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $S$ a nonabelian finite $p$-group. In [9, 10], they proposed the following conjecture: if $\mathcal{F}$ be a transitive fusion system over a finite $p$-group $S$, then $S$ is either extraspecial of order $p^{3}$ or elementary abelian. In this note, we use an easy method to prove that this conjecture holds when the $p$-rank of $S$ is 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our primary focus is on the theory of skew braces, specifically exploring their connection with combinatorial solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. Skew braces have recently emerged as intriguing algebraic structures, and their link to the Yang-Baxter equation adds further depth and significance to their study. Throughout this article, we place particular emphasis on various problems and conjectures that arise within this field. These open questions serve to stimulate further research and investigation, as we strive to enhance our understanding of skew braces and their role in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>
