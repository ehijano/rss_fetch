      <title>Convergence of physics-informed neural networks modeling time-harmonic wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution, we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$ error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including absorbers.</description>

      <title>CLEAN-MI: A Scalable and Efficient Pipeline for Constructing High-Quality Neurodata in Motor Imagery Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient, and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent improvements in data quality and classification performance.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of the 'Follow-the-Sun' Strategy in Mitigating the Carbon Footprint of AI in Cloud Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of 16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.</description>

      <title>An Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator for Evolving Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown, evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.</description>

      <title>PPDiff: Diffusing in Hybrid Sequence-Structure Space for Protein-Protein Complex Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC), which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising 706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the performance of multi-fidelity and reduced-dimensional neural emulators for inference of physiologic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.</description>

      <title>Level set-based inverse homogenisation of three-dimensional piezoelectric materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use memory-distributed level set-based topology optimisation to design three-dimensional periodic piezoelectric materials with enhanced properties. We compare and assess several existing iterative solvers with respect to their weak scalability and find that an approximate Schur complement preconditioned generalized minimal residual method method demonstrates the best performance and scalability for solving the piezoelectric homogenisation equations. We use the developed techniques to computationally design high-resolution piezoelectric metamaterials with enhanced stiffness and piezoelectric properties that yield new insights into material design for sensor, hydrophone, and actuator applications. We suggest two robust structures with no fine-scale features that exhibit enhanced piezoelectric properties several times larger than those of the base material. We find that level set-based topology optimisation is well suited to problems involving piezoelectricity and has the advantage of avoiding large regions of intermediate density material. Our memory-distributed level-set implementation is open source and provided for practitioners in the community.</description>

      <title>Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.</description>

      <title>PDESpectralRefiner: Achieving More Accurate Long Rollouts with Spectral Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating accurate and stable long rollouts is a notorious challenge for time-dependent PDEs (Partial Differential Equations). Recently, motivated by the importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner utilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the denoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency part. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the amplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process. However, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For example, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could over-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the constraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model with doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion models. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion models, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step. We show that in this case, for different model backbones, such as U-Net and neural operators, the outputs of PDE-SpectralRefiner are more accurate for both one-step MSE loss and rollout loss.</description>

      <title>How Much is Enough? The Diminishing Returns of Tokenization Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a language typologically distant from English. For Russian text, we observe diminishing returns after training a tokenizer from 200GB of data, which is approximately 33% more than when training on English. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions for future research in tokenization algorithms.</description>
