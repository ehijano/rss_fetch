      <title>Exploring the Multifractal Behavior of the Human Genome T2T-CHM13v2.0: Graphical Representations and Cytogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we applied the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) to the complete human genomic sequence T2T-CHM13v2.0, analyzing the entire chromosome assembly and each chromosome separately, including mitochondrial DNA. Multifractal spectra were determined using two types of box-counting coverage, revealing slight variations across most chromosomes. While the geometric support remained consistent, distinct distributions were observed for each chromosome. Chromosomes 9 and Y exhibited the greatest differences in singularity (H\"older exponent), with minor variations in their fractal support. The CGR distributions generally demonstrated an approximate separation between coding and non-coding sections, as well as CpG or GpC islands. A base-by-base analysis of the fractal support of the CGR uncovered characteristic structural bands in chromosome sequences, which align with patterns identified in cytogenetic studies. Using the complete assembly as a reference, we compared two alternative representations: the Binary Genomic Representation (RGB) and the Markov Chain (MC) representation. Both methods tended toward the same fractal support but displayed differing distributions based on the assigned length parameter. Multifractal analysis highlighted quantitative differences between these representations: RGB aligned more closely with high-frequency components, while MC showed better correspondence with low frequencies. The optimal fit was achieved using MC for twelve-base chains, yielding an average percentage error of 2% relative to the full genomic assembly.</description>

      <title>Investigation of phytochemicals, spectral properties, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antimicrobial activities of chosen Ayurvedic remedies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the phytochemical characteristics of Ayurvedic products. An analysis was performed on Kottakkal Ayurveda Triphala (T), Kottakkal Ayurveda Hinguvachadi Churnam (H), and Kottakkal Ayurveda Jirakadyarishtam (J) using GC-MS and LC-MS techniques to determine their bioactive constituents, while also assessing their antimicrobial, docking, anticancer, and anti-diabetic activities. The GC-MS analysis identified 30, 45, and 8 chemical components in Kottakkal Ayurveda Triphala (T), Kottakkal Ayurveda Hinguvachadi Churnam (H), and Kottakkal Ayurveda Jirakadyarishtam (J), respectively. The LC-MS analysis produced 15, 20, and 16 peaks for Kottakkal Ayurveda Triphala (T), Kottakkal Ayurveda Hinguvachadi Churnam (H), and Kottakkal Ayurveda Jirakadyarishtam (J), with m/z values of 982, 981, 972, and 933; 987, 985, 974, and 945; and 969, 965, 951, and 941, respectively, confirming their precision. Moreover, characterization of the Ayurvedic products was carried out using FT-IR, UV-vis, and 1H-NMR spectroscopy to identify significant functional groups and chemical substances. Kottakkal Ayurveda Triphala (T) was evaluated for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) along with Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae), yielding a P value of 0.0650 (P &lt; 0.0001). Both Kottakkal Ayurveda Hinguvachadi Churnam (H) and Kottakkal Ayurveda Jirakadyarishtam (J) were subjected to analysis for their effectiveness against Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, also revealing a P value within the acceptable range of 0.0650 (P &lt; 0.0001). The anti-diabetic properties of Kottakkal Ayurveda Triphala (T) were assessed using the {\alpha}-glucosidase inhibitory method, which exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on {\alpha}-glucosidase, resulting in an average P value of 0.001 (P &lt; 0.0001).</description>
