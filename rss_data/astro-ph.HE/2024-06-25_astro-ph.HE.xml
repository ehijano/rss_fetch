      <title>Ticking away: the long-term X-ray timing and spectral evolution of eRO-QPE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeated X-ray flares from galactic nuclei. Despite some diversity in the recurrence and amplitude of eruptions, their striking regularity has motivated theorists to associate QPEs with orbital systems. Among the known QPE sources, eRO-QPE2 has shown the most regular flare timing and luminosity since its discovery. We report here on its long-term evolution over $\sim3.3\,$yr from discovery and find that: i) the average QPE recurrence time per epoch has decreased over time, albeit not at a uniform rate; ii) the distinct alternation between consecutive long and short recurrence times found at discovery has not been significant since; iii) the spectral properties, namely flux and temperature of both eruptions and quiescence components, have remained remarkably consistent within uncertainties. We attempted to interpret these results as orbital period and eccentricity decay coupled with orbital and disk precession. However, since gaps between observations are too long, we are not able to distinguish between an evolution dominated by just a decreasing trend, or by large modulations (e.g. due to the precession frequencies at play). In the former case, the observed period decrease is roughly consistent with that of a star losing orbital energy due to hydrodynamic gas drag from disk collisions, although the related eccentricity decay is too fast and additional modulations have to contribute too. In the latter case, no conclusive remarks are possible on the orbital evolution and the nature of the orbiter due to the many effects at play. However, these two cases come with distinctive predictions for future X-ray data: in the former, we expect all future observations to show a shorter recurrence time than the latest epoch, while in the latter we expect some future observations to be found with a larger recurrence, hence an apparent temporary period increase.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2: IX. Studying the Dynamics of the Ionized Obscurer in Mrk 817 with High-resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken as part of the ongoing, intensive multi-wavelength monitoring program of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (AGN STORM 2) Project. The campaign revealed an unexpected and transient obscuring outflow, never before seen in this source. Of our four XMM-Newton/NuSTAR epochs, one fortuitously taken during a bright X-ray state has strong narrow absorption lines in the high-resolution grating spectra. From these absorption features, we determine that the obscurer is in fact a multi-phase ionized wind with an outflow velocity of $\sim$5200 km s$^{-1}$, and for the first time find evidence for a lower ionization component with the same velocity observed in absorption features in the contemporaneous HST spectra. This indicates that the UV absorption troughs may be due to dense clumps embedded in diffuse, higher ionization gas responsible for the X-ray absorption lines of the same velocity. We observe variability in the shape of the absorption lines on timescales of hours, placing the variable component at roughly 1000 $R_g$ if attributed to transverse motion along the line of sight. This estimate aligns with independent UV measurements of the distance to the obscurer suggesting an accretion disk wind at the inner broad line region. We estimate that it takes roughly 200 days for the outflow to travel from the disk to our line of sight, consistent with the timescale of the outflow's column density variations throughout the campaign.</description>

      <title>Timing irregularities and glitches from the pulsar monitoring campaign at IAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Pulsars have a very stable rotation. However, sudden increases in their rotation frequency known as glitches, perturb their evolution. While large glitches are commonly detected, small glitches are harder to detect because of the lack of daily-cadence observations over long periods of time.
  Aims. We aim to explore the timing behaviour of young pulsars at daily timescales looking for small glitches and other irregularities. This will further our comprehension of the distribution of glitch sizes, which has also consequences for the theoretical modeling of the glitch mechanism.
  Methods. We observed six pulsars with up to daily cadence during 5 years with the antennas of the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR). We used standard pulsar timing tools to characterise the rotation of pulsars and developed an algorithm to look for small timing events in the data and calculate the changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$ at those epochs.
  Results. We found that the rotation of pulsars in this dataset is affected by small step changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$. We found three glitches that had not been reported before: two in PSR J1048-5832 with relative sizes $\Delta\nu / \nu= 9.1(4) \times 10^{-10}$ and $\Delta\nu / \nu = 4.5(1) \times 10^{-10}$, and one in the Vela pulsar with a size $\Delta\nu / \nu = 2.0(2) \times 10^{-10}$. We also report new decay terms on the 2021 Vela giant glitch, and on the 2022 giant glitches in PSR J0742-2822 and PSR J1740-3015 respectively. Besides, we found that the red noise contribution significantly diminished in PSR J0742-2822 after its giant glitch in 2022.
  Conclusions. Our results highlight the importance of high-cadence monitoring with an exhaustive analysis of the residuals to better characterize the distribution of glitch sizes and to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind glitches, red noise and timing irregularities.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasi-periodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the RGS gratings onboard XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by $1700-2900$ km/s, with a column density of about $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})$ of $3.9-4.6$. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km/s, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full $4\pi$ sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components mostly contributing to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>The Crucial First Step in the Discovery of Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, like pulsars, have led to major advances in many areas of astronomy and physics. The discovery in 2023 of a cosmological gravitational wave (GW) stochastic background using millisecond pulsar timing arrays has focused attention on the importance of millisecond pulsars, to both multi-messenger astronomy and cosmology, and for identifying the origin of the GW stochastic background, which is hypothesized to be due to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Unlike pulsars, however, for which the details of the discovery are well-known, those of millisecond pulsars are not well known. In particular, the details of the first crucial step in the discovery of millisecond pulsars, namely the discovery of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) in the radio source 4C 21.53, are known only to the author. This article presents a first-hand account of this crucial first step, which resulted ultimately in the discovery of millisecond pulses from this object. A brief description of interplanetary and interstellar scintillation and scattering is given in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Couplings of torsional and shear oscillations in a neutron star crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mature neutron stars are thought to be sufficiently cold that nuclei in the outer layers freeze, solidifying a crust. Crustal elasticity allows the star to support a set of seismic modes, such as torsional oscillations. These axial-parity modes can couple to the polar sector in a number of ways, for example via rotation or a magnetic field. Even in a static, spherically-symmetric star however these modes can couple at non-linear order. In this study, such couplings in the crust are examined for the first time: we derive the axisymmetric perturbation equations for second-order axial eigenfunctions, which are sourced by axial-polar couplings at first-order, and solve the resulting equations in the time domain. Through our studies, we find that the second-order spectrum contains additional oscillation modes, not predicted by the linear analysis with either axial or polar perturbations, which can be excited to relatively large amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Broad band spectral modeling of M87 nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectra produced by weakly accreting black hole (BH) systems using the semi-analytic advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and the general-relativistic magentohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation. We find significant differences between these two approaches related to a wider spread of the flow parameters as well as a much steeper radial distribution of the magnetic field in the latter. We apply these spectral models to the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87 galaxy. The standard (in particular, one-dimensional) formulation of the ADAF model does not allow to explain it; previous claims that this model reproduces the observed SED suffer from an inaccurate treatment of the Compton process. The spectra based on GRMHD simulation are in a much better agreement with the observed data. In our GRMHD model, in which we assumed the BH spin $a=0.9$, bulk of radiation observed between the millimeter and the X-ray range is produced in the disk area between 2 and 4 gravitational radii from the BH. In this solution, the synchrotron component easily reproduces the spectral data between the millimeter and the UV range, and the Compton component does not violate the X-rays constraints, for accretion rates not exceeding 0.01 Msun/year and a relatively strong magnetic field, with the plasma $\beta \sim 1$ in the region where radiation is produced. However, the Compton component cannot explain the observed X-ray spectrum. Instead, the X-ray spectrum can be reproduced by a high energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum if electrons have a hybrid energy distribution with a $\sim 5$ per cent nonthermal component.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Physical Parameters of Blazars Using the Seed Factor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery that blazars dominate the extra-galactic {\gamma}-ray sky is a triumph in the Fermi era. However, the exact location of {\gamma}-ray emission region still remains in debate. Low-synchrotron-peaked blazars (LSPs) are estimated to produce high-energy radiation through the external Compton process, thus their emission regions are closely related to the external photon fields. We employed the seed factor approach proposed by Georganopoulos et al. It directly matches the observed seed factor of each LSP with the characteristic seed factors of external photon fields to locate the {\gamma}-ray emission region. A sample of 1138 LSPs with peak frequencies and peak luminosities was adopted to plot a histogram distribution of observed seed factors. We also collected some spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of historical flare states to investigate the variation of {\gamma}-ray emission region. Those SEDs were fitted by both quadratic and cubic functions using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, we derived some physical parameters of blazars and compared them with the constraint of internal {\gamma}{\gamma}-absorption. We find that dusty torus dominates the soft photon fields of LSPs and most {\gamma}-ray emission regions of LSPs are located at 1-10 pc. The soft photon fields could also transition from dusty torus to broad line region and cosmic microwave background in different flare states. Our results suggest that the cubic function is better than the quadratic function to fit the SEDs.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is not still completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than $\gamma = 1.58$. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of $\gamma = 1.7-2.1$. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when $\gamma = 2.0$ and $2.1$ are too high to be consistent with the observed properties that BH LMXBs appears as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.</description>

      <title>The optical spectropolarimetric behaviour of a selection of high-energy blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At optical/ultraviolet energies, blazars display an underlying thermal (unpolarized) contribution from the accretion disc, torus and line emitting regions, diluting the polarized emission from the jet-component. Optical polarimetry can be used to disentangle the thermal and non-thermal components, and place constraints on the particle populations and acceleration mechanisms responsible for the non-thermal emission. We present the results of a linear optical spectropolarimetric observing campaign of 18 blazars (6 BLLs and 12 FSRQs) undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope between 2016 and 2022. This was done to observe these systems during flaring states, as well as long term monitoring of PKS1510-089, AP Lib and PKS 1034-293. The observations traced the frequency dependence of the degree and angle of polarization, as well as changes in the spectral line strengths. We investigated possible correlations between the polarization and other observed characteristics for the sources. While an indication of correlation was found between the frequency dependence and the average level of polarization for some sources, a correlation was not found for the population as a whole. These results highlight that continuous observations and in-depth modelling of polarization and its frequency dependence is required to obtain a more holistic view of TeV blazars.</description>

      <title>A look at the high energy aspects of the supernova remnant G309.8+00.0 with eROSITA and Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnant (SNR) detection along the Galactic plane poses a number of challenges. The SNR G309.8+00.0 lies exactly on the Galactic plane, with its center coinciding with galactic latitude (b)=0 deg. In this paper we report the first detection of the SNR G309.8+00.0 in X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, using stacked data from the first four consecutive extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) -- on board the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) -- all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) and $\sim15.5$ yr of Pass 8 data recorded from Fermi-LAT, respectively. The SNR appears to have an elliptical shape of 0.43 x 0.32 deg in size in both radio synchrotron and X-ray data. The SNR's emission exhibits a shell-like morphology and good spatial correlation in both energy bands. The X-ray emission was solely detected in the 1-2 keV energy band (subject to strong absorption at soft X-rays) and the spectral analysis results of eRASS:4 data present a purely thermal SNR with a high absorption column density $3.1_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $0.34\pm0.1$ keV. In combination with optical extinction data, the absorption column density values derived from the remnant's spectral analysis support a remnant's distance greater than 6 kpc, rather than a 3.12 kpc distance as reported in the literature, and yield an age of $1-3.5\cdot10^5$ yr. Employing $\sim15.5$ yr of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data at and around the remnant's vicinity, we confirm the detection of the to-date unidentified 4FGL J1349.5-6206c source that can either be modeled as a single source or a conglomerate of multiple distinct source components and we argue that the SNR G309.8+00.0 likely represents at least a significant portion (if not all) of the emission from the 4FGL J1349.5-6206c $\gamma$-ray source.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the origin of Short Gamma ray Bursts with or without extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. The spatial distribution and merger rate differ between BNS mergers and NS-BH mergers. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we investigated the origin of these burst types in terms of their formation rate. We examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without assuming any specific model.The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ for standard sGRBs and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.21 \pm 0.22}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.22 \pm 0.47}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for standard sGRBs, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.30 \pm 0.13}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.33 \pm 0.66}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is no significant difference in the progenitor stars of sGRBs with and without EE, considering the spatial offset and formation rate perspectives.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach to Event Reconstruction for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes Combining Machine Learning and Likelihood Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique provides potentially the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy at energies above the X-ray waveband. High-resolution measurements provide the key to progress on many of the major questions in high-energy astrophysics, including the sites of particle acceleration to PeV energies. The potential of the next-generation CTA observatory in this regard can be realised with the help of improved algorithms for the reconstruction of the air-shower direction and energy. Hybrid methods combining likelihood-fitting techniques with neural networks represent a particularly promising approach and have recently been applied to the reconstruction of astrophysical neutrinos. Here, we present the FreePACT algorithm, a hybrid reconstruction method for IACTs. In this, making use of the neural ratio estimation technique from the field of likelihood-free inference, the analytical likelihood used in traditional image likelihood fitting is replaced by a neural network that approximates the charge probability density function for each pixel in the camera. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of the planned CTA southern array. For this setup, FreePACT provides significant performance improvements over analytical likelihood techniques, with improvements in angular and energy resolution of 25% or more over a wide energy range and an angular resolution as low as 40 arcseconds at energies above 50 TeV for observations at 20 degrees zenith angle. It also yields more accurate estimations of the uncertainties on the reconstructed parameters and speeds up the reconstruction compared to analytical likelihood techniques while showing the same stability with respect to changes in the observation conditions. Therefore, the FreePACT method is a promising upgrade over the current state-of-the-art likelihood event reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Spectro-Temporal Properties of the Black Hole Candidate Swift J151857.0-572147 during its First Outburst in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, in March 2024, the transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J151857.0-572147 experienced an outburst. Using publicly available archived {\it Insight}-HXMT data, we analyze the timing and spectral features of this source. Through model fitting of the power density spectrum, we were able to extract the properties of quasi-periodic oscillations, and based on those properties, we have determined that the QPOs are of type C. We also conclude that the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion processes surrounding black holes may be the source of the QPOs. This shock instability could produce variabilities of flux up to 48 keV, as we checked from the QPO energy dependence. High-frequency QPO is not observed during this period. In the broad energy band of $2-100$ keV, simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments of \textit{Insight}-HXMT were used to perform the spectral analysis. A combination of models, including broken power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, interstellar absorption, and reflection in both neutral and ionized medium were needed for spectral fitting to obtain the best fit. We discovered that at the beginning of the analysis period, the source was in an intermediate state and was transitioning toward the softer states based on the spectral features. It has a hydrogen column density of $(4.3-6.9) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be &gt;1e51 erg and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism has difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This suggests that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), adding to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.</description>

      <title>Accessing a New Population of Supermassive Black Holes with Extensions to the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope has produced resolved images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*, which present the largest shadows on the sky. In the next decade, technological improvements and extensions to the array will enable access to a greater number of sources, unlocking studies of a larger population of supermassive black holes through direct imaging. In this paper, we identify 12 of the most promising sources beyond Sgr A* and M87* based on their angular size and millimeter flux density. For each of these sources, we make theoretical predictions for their observable properties by ray tracing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic models appropriately scaled to each target's mass, distance, and flux density. We predict that these sources would have somewhat higher Eddington ratios than M87*, which may result in larger optical and Faraday depths than previous EHT targets. Despite this, we find that visibility amplitude size constraints can plausibly recover masses within a factor of 2, although the unknown jet contribution remains a significant uncertainty. We find that the linearly polarized structure evolves substantially with Eddington ratio, with greater evolution at larger inclinations, complicating potential spin inferences for inclined sources. We discuss the importance of 345 GHz observations, milli-Jansky baseline sensitivity, and independent inclination constraints for future observations with upgrades to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) through ground updates with the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) program and extensions to space through the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the gravitational-wave background from supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations spurred a variety of questions regarding the origin of the signal and the properties of its sources. The amplitude of a GW background produced by inspiralling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be predicted in a relatively robust manner from the present-day merged remnants, observed as single SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, but falls short of the signal measured by PTAs by a significant amount, requiring equal mass mergers, extremely short delay times, and no accretion in order to achieve a modest consistency. In this work, we revisit NANOGrav's 15-yr data set and reassess the aforementioned discrepancy using the full spectral information captured by PTA data. As previously noted in the literature, the discrete number of point sources contributing to the background may lead to deviations in the observed spectrum relative to the average ($h^2_c \propto f^{-4/3}$) due to Poisson fluctuations, providing additional information about the source population beyond the background amplitude. We derive a simple expression for the characteristic strain distribution given a SMBH model, which is generally applicable regardless of the method used to model the black hole population. We then refit the NANOGrav free spectrum using a minimal model based on the local mass function, showing that the current GW measurement requires roughly $\sim 10$ times more black holes than suggested by local observations and disfavors mass functions dominated by few very heavy sources, with the typical mass that contributes to the background $\lesssim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$. Given the range of SMBH models found to be consistent with the isotropic background, we address what is the typical number sources that would be individually detectable, given the current sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The neutrino roof: Single-scatter ceilings in dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the maximum cross sections probed by single-scatter ``WIMP" searches in dark matter direct detection. Due to Poisson fluctuations in scatter multiplicity, these ceilings scale logarithmically with mass for heavy dark matter and often lie in regions probed by multiscatter searches. Using a generalized formula for single-scatter event rates we recast WIMP searches by the quintal-to-tonne scale detectors XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ, PANDAX-II, PANDAX-4T, DarkSide-50 and DEAP-3600 to obtain ceilings and floors up to a few $10^{17}$ GeV mass and $10^{-22}$ cm$^2$ per-nucleus cross section. We do this for coherent, geometric, isospin-violating xenophobic and argophobic spin-independent scattering, and neutron-only and proton-only spin-dependent scattering. Future large-exposure detectors would register an almost irreducible background of atmospheric neutrinos that would determine a dark matter sensitivity ceiling that we call the ``neutrino roof", in analogy with the well-studied ``neutrino floor". Accounting for this background, we estimate the reaches of the 10$-$100 tonne scale DarkSide-20k, DARWIN/XLZD, PANDAX-xT, and Argo, which would probe many decades of unconstrained parameter space up to the Planck mass, as well as of $10^3-10^4$ tonne scale noble liquid detectors that have been proposed in synergy with neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of ultralight bosons around compact objects: in-medium suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <title>A New Gravitational Wave Probe to the Nature of Dark Energy from the Aging of the Universe: Can Future Detectors Achieve it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most dominant energy budget of the Universe is Dark Energy, which remains enigmatic since the claim of its existence from the observation of late-time cosmic acceleration. We propose a new way of inferring this by measuring the aging of the Universe using only gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binary compact objects of any masses. We show that the aging of the Universe will lead to a change in the observed chirp mass of the GW sources inferred from different stages of its coalesces by monitoring a coherent source from two far-apart GW frequencies for a few years. We show that coordinated GW detectors which can reach a relative uncertainty on chirp mass measurement of about $10^{-9}$, can measure a tiny departure of about $2\%$ from the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0=-1$ and its variation with cosmic time by using stellar origin binary black holes up to redshift $z=5$ in 10 years of observation time without using any external calibrator. If the next generation of GW detectors can achieve this precision, then it can open a new window to discover the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid isentropic twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of hybrid neutron stars with color superconducting quark matter cores at finite temperature that results in sequences of stars with constant entropy per baryon, $s/n_B={\rm const}$. For the quark matter equation of state, we employ a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model while nuclear matter is described with a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class. The phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction under isothermal conditions. We find that traversing the mixed phase on a trajectory at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ in the phase diagram shows a heating effect while at larger $s/n_B$ the temperature drops. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of a color superconducting quark matter phase at low temperatures and the melting of the diquark condensate which restores the normal quark matter phase at higher temperatures. While the isentropic hybrid star branch at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ is connected to the neutron star branch, it gets disconnected at higher entropy per baryon so that the "thermal twin" phenomenon is observed. We find that the transition from connected to disconnected hybrid star sequences may be estimated with the Seidov criterion for the difference in energy densities. The radii and masses at the onset of deconfinement exhibit a linear relationship and thus define a critical compactness of the isentropic star configuration for which the transition occurs which for large enough $s/n_B\gtrsim 2$ is accompanied by an instability. The results of this study may be of relevance for uncovering the conditions for the supernova explodability of massive blue supergiant stars by the quark deconfinement mechanism. The accretion-induced deconfinement transition with thermal twin formation may contribute to explaining the origin of eccentric orbits in some binary systems and the origin of isolated millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity VIII. Stellar and wind parameters of newly revealed stripped stars in Be binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectropolarimetric Variability Properties in Blazars PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089</title>

Abstract: Spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to investigate the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as polarization signatures are key to probing magnetic field structure, evolution, and the physics of particle acceleration in jets. Optical linear polarization of blazars is typically greater than a few percent, indicating the emission is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation, while polarization less than a few percent is common for other type 1 AGNs. We present a spectropolarimetric study of PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089 to determine how the head-on orientation of a jet and dominant emission processes influence polarimetric variations in the broad lines and continuum. Observations were obtained biweekly from the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern African Large Telescope. Variability in the continuum polarization is detected for both PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089, with a total average level of 2.5% +/- 0.1% and 7.5% +/- 0.1%, respectively. There is no clear polarization in the broad Balmer emission lines and weak polarization in Mg II as the average level across all observations is 0.2% +/- 0.1% for Hbeta, 0.2% +/- 0.3% for Hgamma, and 0.6% +/- 0.2% for Mg II. We find that polarization measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from spectral energy distribution modeling of the disk-jet contributions to the emission as optical polarization and time variability for PKS 0637-75 are shown to be dominated by accretion disk emission while those of PKS 1510-089 are due to both disk and jet emission, with greater jet contribution during flaring states.</description>

      <title>The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

Abstract: The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.</description>

Abstract: In gamma-ray binaries neutron star is orbiting a companion that produces a strong stellar wind. We demonstrate that observed properties of "stellar wind"-"pulsar wind" interaction depend both on the overall wind thrust ratio, as well as more subtle geometrical factors: the relative direction of the pulsar's spin, the plane of the orbit, the direction of motion, and the instantaneous line of sight. Using fully 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations we find that the resulting intrinsic morphologies can be significantly orbital phase-dependent: a given system may change from tailward-open to tailward-closed shapes. As a result, the region of unshocked pulsar wind can change by an order of magnitude over a quarter of the orbit. We calculate radiation maps and synthetic light curves for synchrotron (X-ray) and Inverse-Compton emission (GeV-TeV), taking into account $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. Our modeled light curves are in agreement with the phase-dependent observed light curves of LS5039.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal radiation from dual jet interactions in supermassive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are natural by-products of galaxy mergers and are expected to be powerful multi-messenger sources. They can be powered by the accretion of matter and then radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, much like normal active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Current electromagnetic observatories have a good chance of detecting and identifying these systems in the near future. However, precise observational indicators are needed to distinguish individual AGNs from SMBHBs. In this paper, we propose a novel electromagnetic signature from SMBHBs: non-thermal emission produced by the interaction between the jets ejected by the black holes. We study close SMBHBs, which accrete matter from a circumbinary disc and the mini-discs formed around each hole. Each black hole ejects a magnetically dominated jet in the direction of its spin through the Blandford--Znajeck mechanism. We argue that in such a situation, the interaction between the jets can trigger strong magnetic reconnection events, where particles are accelerated and emit non-thermal radiation. Depending on whether the jets are aligned or misaligned, this radiation can have different periodicities. We model the evolution of the particles accelerated during the dual jet interaction and calculate their radiative output, obtaining spectra and providing estimates for the variability timescales. We finally discuss how this emission compares with that of normal AGNs.</description>

      <title>The afterglow of GW170817 from every angle: Prospects for detecting the afterglows of binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date GW170817, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, is the only gravitational wave event with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. It was associated with a prompt short gamma-ray burst (GRB), an optical kilonova, and the afterglow of a structured, off-axis relativistic jet. We model the prospects for future mergers discovered in gravitational waves to produce detectable afterglows. Using a model fit to GW170817, we assume all BNS mergers produce jets with the same parameters, and model the afterglow luminosity for a full distribution of observer angles, ISM densities, and distances. We find that in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 run, 30% - 45% of BNS mergers with a well-localized counterpart will have an afterglow detectable with current instrumentation in the X-ray, radio and optical. Without a previously detected counterpart, 10% - 15% will have an afterglow detectable by wide-area radio and optical surveys, compared to only about 5% - 12% of events expected to have bright (on-axis) gamma-ray emission. Most afterglows that are detected will be from off-axis jets. Further in the future, in the A+ era (O5), 40% - 50% of mergers will have afterglows detectable with next-generation X-ray and radio instruments. Future wide-area radio survey instruments, particularly DSA-2000, could detect 40% of afterglows, even without a kilonova counterpart. Finding and monitoring these afterglows will provide valuable insight into the structure and diversity of relativistic jets, the rate at which mergers produce jets, and constrain the angle of the mergers relative to our line of sight.</description>

      <title>Framework for Multi-messenger Inference from Neutron Stars: Combining Nuclear Theory Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an efficient parameterization of the pure neutron-matter equation of state (EoS) that incorporates the uncertainties from both chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and phenomenological potential calculations. This parameterization yields a family of EoSs including and extending the forms based purely on these two calculations. In combination with an agnostic inner core EoS, this parameterization is used in a Bayesian inference pipeline to obtain constraints on the e os parameters using multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. We specifically considered observations of the massive pulsar J0740+6620, the binary neutron star coalescence GW170817, and the NICER pulsar J0030+0451. Constraints on neutron star mass-radius relations are obtained and compared. The Bayes factors for the different EoS models are also computed. While current constraints do not reveal any significant preference among these models, the framework developed here may enable future observations with more sensitive detectors to discriminate them.</description>

      <title>Distribution of orbital inclinations for tidal disruption events by Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr metric that describes the spacetime of a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) is axisymmetric, implying that the nearly parabolic geodesics on which stars approach the SMBH depend on the inclination angle $\iota$ of the orbital angular momentum with respect to the SMBH spin. This inclination affects both the geodesic deviation that determines whether a star is tidally disrupted and whether the tidal debris survives direct capture by the event horizon to produce an observable tidal disruption event (TDE). The steady-state TDE rate is the rate at which stars are scattered into the loss cone determined by these spin- and inclination-dependent effects. As the anisotropy of this loss-cone refilling is highly uncertain, we consider the two extreme limits in which stellar inclination is preserved (IP) or isotropized (ISO). We calculate the inclination distribution in these two limits and find a prograde bias in the IP limit because of the strong retrograde bias for direct capture. However, we find a retrograde bias in the ISO limit for intermediate SMBH masses when the empty loss cone suppresses capture and allows the weaker retrograde bias of geodesic deviation to dominate. Partially empty loss cones lead to steeper distributions of the penetration factor $\beta$ than for a full loss cone, with this effect even more pronounced in the ISO limit. We also calculate the total TDE rates and maximum SMBH mass $M_{\rm \bullet, max}$ for tidal disruption in these two limits. In the IP limit, we find a highly spin-dependent capture cutoff in the TDE rate and $M_{\rm \bullet, max} \approx 10^{8.45} M_\odot$ for maximal SMBH spin. In the ISO limit, we find a strong spin-dependent enhancement in the TDE rate at intermediate SMBH masses, a weakly spin-dependent capture cutoff above $M_\bullet \approx 10^{7.5} M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm \bullet, max} \approx 10^{7.95} M_\odot$ for maximal SMBH spin.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

Abstract: Simeis 147 (S147, G180.0-01.7, "Spaghetti nebula") is a supernova remnant (SNR) extensively studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to giga-electronvolt $\gamma$-rays, except in X-rays. Here, we report the first detection of significant X-ray emission from the entire SNR using data of the extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG). The object is located at the Galactic anticenter, and its 3 deg size classifies it among the largest SNRs ever detected in X-rays. By employing $\sim$15 years of Fermi-LAT data, our study confirms the association of the remnant with a spatially coincident diffuse giga-electronvolt excess, namely 4FGL J0540.3+2756e or FGES J0537.6+2751. The X-ray emission is purely thermal, exhibiting strong O, Ne, and Mg lines; whereas it lacks heavier-Z elements. The emission is mainly confined to the 0.5-1.0 keV band; no significant emission is detected above 2.0 keV. Both a collisional plasma model in equilibrium and a model of nonequilibrium collisional plasma can fit the total spectrum. While the equilibrium model -- though statistically disfavored -- cannot be excluded by X-ray fitting, only the absorption column of the nonequilibrium model is consistent with expectations derived from optical extinction data. Adopting an expansion in a homogeneous medium of typical interstellar medium (ISM) density, the general SNR properties are broadly consistent with an expansion model that yields an estimated age of $\sim0.66-2\times10^{5}$ yr, that is a rather old age. The preference for an X-ray-emitting plasma in nonequilibrium, however, adds to the observational evidence that favors a substantially younger age. In a companion paper, we explore an SNR-in-cavity scenario, resulting in a much younger age that alleviates some of the inconsistencies of the old-age scenario.</description>

Abstract: While 30 Dor C is a unique superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its luminous non-thermal X-ray emission, the thermal X-ray emission it emanates has not yet been thoroughly investigated and well constrained. Based on the separate ~1 Ms deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we report the discovery of the thermally-emitting plasma in some portions of the western half of 30 Dor C. The thermal emission can be reproduced by a collisional-ionization-equilibrium plasma model with an average electron temperature of ~0.4 keV. We find a significant overabundance of the intermediate-mass elements such as O, Ne, Mg, and Si, which may be indicative of a recent supernova explosion in 30 Dor C. Dynamical properties in combination with the information of the OB association LH 90 suggest that the internal post-main-sequence stars dominate the power of the superbubble and blow it out in the past ~1 Myr.</description>

      <title>Evolution of secondary electron spectrum during cosmic-ray discharge in the universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the reconstructed properties of the Amaterasu particle, the second-highest energy cosmic ray ever detected, to map out three-dimensional constraints on the location of its unknown source. We highlight possible astrophysical sources that are compatible with these regions and requirements. Among these, M82, a powerful starburst galaxy, stands out as a strong candidate due to its position and proximity. To derive our constraints, we use CRPropa 3 to model all relevant propagation effects, including deflections in the Galactic and extra-Galactic magnetic fields. We consider key input quantities such as source distance, position, energy, and the strength and coherence length of the extra-Galactic magnetic field as free parameters. We then infer constraints on these parameters by applying approximate Bayesian computation. We present our results, demonstrating the impact of different assumptions for the arrival mass of the Amaterasu particle and the systematic uncertainties on the energy scale.</description>

Abstract: The successful observation of gravitational waves has provided humanity with an additional method to explore the universe, particularly black holes. In this study, we utilize data from LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observations to test the first law of black hole mechanics, employing two different approaches. We consider the secondary compact object as a perturbation to the primary black hole before the merger, and the remnant black hole as a stationary black hole after the merger. In the pre-merger and post-merger analysis, our results demonstrate consistency with the first law, with an error level of approximate 25% at a 68% credibility level for GW190403 051519. In the full inspiral-merger-ringdown analysis, our results show consistency with the first law of black hole mechanics, with an error level of about 6% at a 68% credibility level and 10% at a 95% credibility level for GW191219 163120. Additionally, we observe that the higher the mass ratio of the gravitational wave source, the more consistent our results are with the first law of black hole mechanics. Overall, our study sheds light on the nature of compact binary coalescence and their implications for black hole mechanics.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: relativistic point-mass treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if they exist, may collide with and be captured by neutron stars. We adopt a relativistic point-mass approximation to study this capture, the subsequent confinement of the PBH of mass $m$ inside the neutron star of mass $M_* \gg m$, and the PBH's growth by accretion of stellar material. Building on earlier treatments we systematically study the capture, confinement, and accretion process, characterize the emitted quasiperiodic continuous gravitational-wave signal, track the evolution of the PBH's orbital parameters, and compare the effects of different choices for the prescription of the dissipative forces. Our point-mass treatment here is applicable in the limit of small PBH masses, for which its effects on the neutron star can be ignored.</description>

      <title>Black Hole shadows of $\alpha'$-corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>
