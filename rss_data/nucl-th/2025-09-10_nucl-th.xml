      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculation of $\delta_{\rm NS}$ in $^{10}$C using an effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07310v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute radiative corrections to the superallowed $\beta$ decay of $^{10}{\rm C}$ in an effective field theory approach using nuclear matrix elements obtained from quantum Monte Carlo calculations. These corrections are an important ingredient in the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Masakawa quark mixing matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the role of this work is to illuminate the uncertainties arising from nuclear structure. Our results provide good agreement with both the traditional extraction of $V_{ud}$, as well as with a more recent evaluation performed using the no-core shell model and a dispersion formalism. The dominant uncertainty in this approach is the presence of two unknown low-energy constants that enter into the relevant nuclear matrix elements. Future determinations of these low-energy constants -- either from QCD or modeling them with two nucleon amplitudes -- would improve the precision of the extraction in this formalism.</description>

      <title>$K^*(892)$ Resonance Suppression in Ar+Sc Collisions at SPS Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production and suppression of short-lived $K^*(892)$ resonances in p+p and Ar+Sc collisions at CERN-SPS energies ($\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = $ 8.8, 11.9, and 16.8~GeV) using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. We present multiplicities, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions, and analyze the $K^*/K$ yield ratios as a function of energy and centrality. We further estimate the time interval between chemical and kinetic freeze-out using the experimental method. A detailed comparison with recent NA61/SHINE data demonstrates that the UrQMD model captures the essential features of resonance dynamics, although the very strong resonance suppression in central collisions observed in the data cannot be quantitatively reproduced.</description>

      <title>$B(E2;2^{+}_{1}\rightarrow0^{+}_{1})$ anomaly in $^{166}$Os</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the very small $B(E2;2_{1}^{+}\rightarrow0_{1}^{+})$ value was found in $^{166}$Os, which is 7(4) W.u. \textbf{and} much smaller than the values of adjacent nuclei $^{168,170}$Os, 74(13) W.u. and 97(9) W.u.. With the help of a new technique ``SU(3) analysis" and a new explanatory framework of the B(E2) anomaly, it was found that, the $B(E2;2_{1}^{+}\rightarrow0_{1}^{+})$ anomaly really can exist. In this paper, we discuss the $B(E2;2_{1}^{+}\rightarrow0_{1}^{+})$ anomaly in $^{166}$Os for the first time. Four results are used to fit the experimental data in $^{166,168,170}$Os successfully. This implies that the level-crossing or level-anticrossing explanation is more reasonable.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Data Adjustment for Nonlinear Applications in the OECD/NEA WPNCS SG14 Benchmark -- A Bayesian Inverse UQ-based Approach for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to assess the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications. This work introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a method for nuclear data adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the more traditional methods of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications. When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ posterior predictions to computed model responses using adjusted parameters, we observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate computed response distributions for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows near agreement, and IUQ uses computed model responses directly. We also discuss observations on why experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative to nuclear data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark indicates potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.</description>

      <title>Energy loss baseline for light hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.36\,\text{TeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.36\,\text{TeV}$, assuming no final-state interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with state-of-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the nuclear modification factor $R^h_\text{AA}$ in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below $20\,\text{GeV}$. In the intermediate range $20\,\text{GeV} \lesssim p_T^h \lesssim 70\,\text{GeV}$, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to approximately 5\%. At higher momenta ($p_T^h \gtrsim 70\,\text{GeV}$), however, predictions exhibit a marked spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.</description>

      <title>Recursive algorithm for constructing antisymmetric fermionic states in first quantization mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a deterministic quantum algorithm to produce antisymmetric states of single-particle orbitals in the first quantization mapping. Unlike sorting-based antisymmetrization algorithms, which require ordered input states and high Clifford-gate overhead, our approach initializes the state of each particle independently. For a system of $N$ particles and $N_s$ single-particle states, our algorithm prepares antisymmetrized states of non-trivial localized (e.g., Hartree-Fock) orbitals using $O(N^2\sqrt{N_s})$ $T$-gates, outperforming alternative algorithms when $N\lesssim \sqrt{N_s}$. To achieve such scaling, we require $O(\sqrt{N_s})$ dirty ancilla qubits for intermediate calculations. Knowledge of the single-particle states to be antisymmetrized can be leveraged to further improve the efficiency of the circuit, and a measurement-based variant reduces gate cost by roughly a factor of two. We show example circuits for two- and three-particle systems and discuss the generalization to an arbitrary number of particles. For a specific three-particle example, we decompose the circuit into Clifford$+T$ gates and study the impact of noise on the prepared state.</description>

      <title>Predictions for $R_{AA}$ in 5.36 TeV C+C, O+O, and Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on collisions of light nuclei at $\sqrt{s}=5.36$ TeV have recently begun at the LHC. In this regard we make predictions for nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ in 5.36 TeV C+C, O+O, and Ne+Ne collisions for scenarios with and without quark-gluon plasma formation in $pp$ collisions. We find a sizeable difference in $R_{AA}$ for these two scenarios, which grows with decreasing atomic number. This says that data on $R_{AA}$ for light nuclei could potentially give information on the presence of jet quenching in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).</description>

      <title>Excitation Spectra of the ${}^{12}{\rm C}(p,d)$ Reaction near the $\eta'$-Meson Emission Threshold Measured in Coincidence with High-Momentum Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The missing mass of the ${}^{12}{\rm C}(p,d)$ reaction has been measured near the $\eta'$-meson emission threshold in coincidence with a high-momentum proton to selectively collect $\eta'$-${}^{11}{\rm C}$ mesic nucleus formation events at GSI, Germany. A 2.5 GeV proton excites a carbon nucleus to form an $\eta'$-mesic nucleus emitting a deuteron forward with an energy of $\sim 1.6$ GeV. The deuteron is momentum-analyzed by the Fragment Separator used as a high-resolution spectrometer to deduce the excitation energy of the residual system. The large-acceptance detector WASA surrounding the target identifies high-momentum protons emitted in the decay of the $\eta'$-mesic nucleus. The measured semi-exclusive spectrum exhibits structures below the threshold though the statistical significance is limited. The spectrum is fitted by theoretically calculated spectra varying optical-potential parameters of the $\eta'$-nucleus interaction. The analysis results indicate $\eta'$-mesic nuclei formation for the real potential depth of $\sim -61$ MeV with a local statistical significance of $3.5 \sigma$ and, taking into account the look-elsewhere effect, a global significance of $2.1 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Typical new spherical-like $\gamma$-soft spectra in $^{104,106,108}$Pd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve the Cd puzzle (spherical nucleus puzzle), I have proposed a new spherical-like $\gamma$-soft nucleus. Since shape coexistence often occurs in such nuclei, explicit spherical-like $\gamma$-soft spectra are not easily identified. In this paper, I finally find the direct evidence for the existence of the new spherical-like $\gamma$-soft nucleus. $^{106}$Pd is in fact a typical spherical-like $\gamma$-soft nucleus. The low-lying parts, up to the $10_{1}^{+}$ state, under 4000 keV, of the spherical-like $\gamma$-soft spectra are verified. The B(E2) values and the quadrupole moments of the low-lying levels are also studied. By comparison, the new spherical-like $\gamma$-soft mode is confirmed. Moreover $^{104,108}$Pd are also discussed. These results completely disprove the possibility of the phonon excitations of the spherical nucleus in the Cd-Pd nuclei region.</description>

      <title>Half-life of $^{136}$Xe for neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay calculated with effective axial-vector current coupling unified for two-neurtino and neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upper limit on the mass of the Majorana neutrino, extracted from the limits on the nonobservation of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, is hampered by uncertainties in the matrix elements of the transition operators. Recently, we have shown that the values of the effective axial-vector current coupling constants ($g_A^\textrm{eff}$) for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decays are close. This striking result was obtained for the first time by including vertex corrections and two-body currents in these matrix elements. In this letter, we calculate the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay ($T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$) of $^{136}$Xe using this closeness and show the convergence of the half-life with respect to the variation of the method to determine $g_A^\textrm{eff}$. The closeness of the $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ of the two decay modes plays a decisive role in predicting $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$. The appropriate value of $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ depends on the assumptions made for the sectors of the nuclear structure and transition operators of the calculations within the perturbation scheme. The value $g_A^\textrm{eff}\approx 1$ is obtained when the SkM$^\ast$ is used to describe the nuclear structure component, while a smaller value of $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ is obtained by applying a less realistic interaction like the SGII one.</description>

      <title>Measurements of azimuthal anisotropies in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $\gamma$+Au collisions from STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we present the first measurements of azimuthal anisotropies, $v_2$ and $v_3$, in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at 200 GeV as a function of transverse momentum and multiplicity, by using two- and four-particle correlation methods. We compare our measurements with STAR measurements of $v_n$ in \dau and \heau collisions to provide insight into the impact of system symmetry on initial condition for small systems. We also investigate the ratio $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ as a function of centrality, which is expected to be sensitive to nucleon-nucleon correlation in the $^{16}$O nucleus.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>

Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering kernels from jet-medium interactions in the QCD medium are perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>High-precision Penning trap mass measurements of neutron-rich chlorine isotopes at the N=28 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is known that the $N=28$ spherical shell closure erodes, the strength of the closure with decreasing proton number $Z&lt;20$ is an open question in nuclear structure. In this region of interest, direct high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{43-45}$Cl isotopes were performed at the Low Energy Beam and Ion Trap (LEBIT) when coupled to the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab. The resulting mass excesses (MEs) are ME($^{43}$Cl) = -24114.4(1.7) keV, ME($^{44}$Cl) = -20450.8(10.6) keV, and ME($^{45}$Cl) = -18240.1(3.7) keV, and improve the uncertainty of these masses by up to a factor of ~40 compared to the previous values reported in the 2020 Atomic Mass Evaluation. Comparison to $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations using the Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG) shows good agreement up to and including the closure.</description>
