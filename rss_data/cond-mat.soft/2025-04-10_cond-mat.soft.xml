      <title>Data-Driven Approach to Hyperelastic Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large deformations of hyperelastic membranes using a purely two-dimensional formulation derived from basic balance principles within a modern geometric setting, ensuring a framework that is independent of an underlying three-dimensional formulation. To assess the predictive capabilities of membrane theory, we compare numerical solutions to experimental data from axisymmetric deformations of a silicone rubber film. Five hyperelastic models - Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Gent, Yeoh, and Ogden - are evaluated by fitting their material parameters to our experimental data using TensorFlow. Our results provide a systematic comparison of these models based on their accuracy in capturing observed deformations, establishing a framework for integrating theory, experiment, and data-driven parameter identification.</description>

      <title>Tuning Diblock Copolymer Morphology by Adding Associative Homopolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tune the microstructures formed by block copolymers using accessible physical approaches provides control for practical material applications. A common strategy involves the addition of homopolymers, which can induce morphological changes through their preferential partitioning into specific microdomains. More recently, supramolecular interactions - being chemistry-specific and stimuli-responsive - have emerged as powerful tools for enabling switchable morphologies. To gain microscopic insight into this process, we present a simulation study of diblock copolymers blended with homopolymers that selectively associate with one of the blocks via reversible associations. By varying the mode of association, we examine the structural changes induced by supramolecular complexation and compare them with those arising from Van der Waals (VDW) interactions. Our results reveal that, despite exhibiting similar levels of homopolymer partitioning, the lamellar structures differ significantly between the association-driven system and the VDW driven system. Cluster analysis indicates that only small clusters form at weak association strength, whereas a continuous network emerges under strong association conditions. Dynamic analysis further indicates that both morphology and supramolecular binding kinetics significantly influence the diffusion of homopolymers across microdomains, highlighting the material's potential responsiveness to external stimuli.</description>

      <title>Flow-driven Stretch Fluctuations Cause Anomalous Rate-Thinning In Elongating Associative Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to verify recent tube-model predictions that associative polymer networks exhibit broad stretch fluctuations during elongational flow. Simulations further show that these fluctuating dynamics give rise to the rate-dependent extensional viscosity $\eta_E$ measured in filament stretching experiments on H-bonding networks. Simulations model bivalent associative networks with a reactive bead-spring model for varying association strength and extensional strain rate. We observe that stretch fluctuations are driven by a new form of chain tumbling, where chains continually collapse and elongate as their associations break and reform within the convecting network. This produces a broad, nearly uniform distribution of chain stretch over a wide range of strain rates, manifesting as a rate-independent plateau in the extensional stress. Our results show that the nonlinear viscoelasticity of associative networks is dominated by large fluctuations in molecular response, which cannot be captured by current mean-field models.</description>

      <title>Orientational ordering in active nematic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vivo and in vitro systems of cells and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) systems are well known to form ordered patterns of orientationally aligned fibers. Here, we interpret them as active analogs of the (disordered) isotropic to the (ordered) nematic phase transition seen in passive liquid crystalline elastomers. A minimal theoretical framework that couples cellular activity (embodied as mechanical stress) and the finite deformation elasticity of liquid crystal elastomers sets the stage to explain these patterns. Linear stability analysis of the governing equations about simple homogeneous isotropic base states shows how the onset of periodic morphologies depends on the activity, elasticity, and applied strain, provides an expression for the wavelength of the instability, and is qualitatively consistent with observations of cell-ECM experiments. Finite element simulations of the nonlinear problem corroborate the results of linear analysis. These results provide quantitative insights into the onset and evolution of nematic order in cell-matrix composites.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation rate of carbon dioxide hydrate formation under experimental condition from Seeding simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleation of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) hydrates from carbon dioxide aqueous solutions by means of molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP4P/Ice and the TraPPE models for water and CO$_2$ respectively. We work at 400 bar and different temperatures and CO$_2$ concentrations. We use brute force molecular dynamics when the supersaturation or the supercooling are so high so that nucleation occurs spontaneously and Seeding otherwise. We used both methods for a particular state and we get a rate of 10$^{25}\,\text{m}^{-3}\text{s}^{-1}$ for nucleation in a CO$_2$ saturated solution at 255 K (35 K of supercooling). By comparison with our previous work on methane hydrates, we conclude that nucleation of CO$_2$ hydrates is several orders of magnitude faster due to a lower interfacial free energy between the crystal and the solution. By combining our nucleation studies with a recent calculation of the hydrate-solution interfacial free energy at coexistence, we obtain a prediction of the nucleation rate temperature dependence for CO$_{2}$-saturated solutions (the experimentally relevant concentration). On the one hand, we open the window for comparison with experiments for supercooling larger than 25 K. On the other hand, we conclude that homogeneous nucleation is impossible for supercooling lower than 20 K. Therefore, nucleation must be heterogeneous in typical experiments where hydrate formation is observed at low supercooling. To assess the hypothesis that nucleation occurs at the solution-CO$_2$ interface we run spontaneous nucleation simulations in two-phase systems and find, by comparison with single-phase simulations, that the interface does not affect hydrate nucleation, at least at the deep supercooling at which this study was carried out (40 and 45 K). Overall, our work sheds light on molecular and thermodynamic aspects of hydrate nucleation.</description>

      <title>Role of activity and dissipation in achieving precise beating in cilia: Insights from the rower model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cilia and flagella are micron-sized filaments that actively beat with remarkable precision in a viscous medium, driving microorganism movement and efficient flow. We study the rower model to uncover how cilia activity and dissipation enable this precise motion. In this model, cilia motion is represented by a micro-beads Brownian movement between two distant harmonic potentials. At specific locations, energy pumps trigger potential switches, capturing cilia activity and generating oscillations. We quantify precision of oscillation using a quality factor, identifying its scaling with activity and oscillation amplitude, finding precision maximization at an optimal amplitude. The data collapse is not accurate for noisy oscillations. An exact analytic expression for the precision quality factor, based on first passage time fluctuations, and derived in the small noise approximation, explains its optimality and scaling. Energy budget analysis shows the quality factor's consistency with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Alignment interactions are essential for flocking, yet alone, they are generally considered insufficient to maintain cohesion against noise, forcing traditional models to rely on artificial boundaries or added attractive forces. Here, we report the first model to achieve cohesive flocking using purely alignment interactions, introducing predictive alignment: agents orient based on the predicted future headings of their neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Block Polymer Materials with Desired Nanoscale Structure and Macroscale Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational design of novel polymers with tailored material properties has been a long-standing challenge in the field due to the large number of possible polymer design variables. To accelerate this design process, there is a critical need to develop novel tools to aid in the inverse design process and efficiently explore the high-dimensional polymer design space. Optimizing macroscale material properties for polymeric systems is difficult as properties are dictated by features on a multitude of length scales, ranging from the chosen monomer chemistries to the chain level design to larger-scale domain structures. In this work, we present an efficient high-throughput in-silico based framework to effectively design high-performance polymers with desired multi-scale nanostructure and macroscale properties, which we call RAPSIDY 2.0 - Rapid Analysis of Polymer Structure and Inverse Design strategY 2.0. This new version of RAPSIDY builds upon our previous work, RAPSIDY 1.0, which focused purely on identifying polymer designs that stabilized a desired nanoscale morphology. In RAPSIDY 2.0 we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Bayesian optimization driven active learning to optimally query high-dimensional polymer design spaces and propose promising design candidates that simultaneously stabilize a selected nanoscale morphology and exhibit desired macroscale material properties. We utilize MD simulations with polymer chains preplaced into selected nanoscale morphologies and perform virtual experiments to determine the stability of the chosen polymer design within the target morphology and calculate the desired macroscale material properties (e.g., thermal conductivity). Our methodology directly addresses the unique challenge associated with copolymers, whose macroscale properties are a function of both their chain design and mesoscale morphology, which are coupled.</description>

      <title>Bistability and charge-density blowup in the onset of drop Quincke rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles in a sufficiently strong electric field spontaneously rotate, provided that charge relaxation is slower in the particle than in the suspending fluid. It has long been known that drops also exhibit such "Quincke rotation," with the electrohydrodynamic flow induced by electrical shear stresses at the interface leading to an increased critical field. However, the hysteretic onset of this instability, observed for sufficiently low-viscosity drops, has so far eluded theoretical understanding -- including simulations that have struggled in this regime owing to charge-density-steepening effects driven by surface convection. Here, we conduct a numerical study of the leaky-dielectric model in a simplified two-dimensional setting involving a circular drop, considering arbitrary viscosity ratios and field strengths. As the viscosity of the drop is decreased relative to the suspending fluid, the pitchfork bifurcation marking the onset of drop rotation is found to transition from supercritical to subcritical, giving rise to a field-strength interval of bistability. In this subcritical regime, the critical field is always large enough that, at the bifurcation, the symmetric base-state solution exhibits equatorial charge-density blowup singularities of the type recently described by Peng et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 9 083701, 2024). As the rotation speed increases along the initially unstable solution branch from the bifurcation, the singularities gradually shift from the equator and ultimately disperse once the rotational component of the flow is strong enough to eliminate the surface stagnation points.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Physical networks become what they learn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.</description>

      <title>How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. The good agreement between the numerical solutions and the LSA allows us to propose a method for measuring surface energy patterns from early time-step film height profiles with good precision. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations. This offers insights into the dependency of the resultant droplet arrays on shape, feature size, and magnitude of the chemical patterning of the underlying substrate.</description>
