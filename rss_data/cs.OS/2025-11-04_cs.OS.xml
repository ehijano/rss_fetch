      <title>Fix: externalizing network I/O in serverless computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a system for serverless computing where users, programs,
  and the underlying platform share a common representation of a
  computation: a deterministic procedure, run in an environment
  of well-specified data or the outputs of other computations. This
  representation externalizes I/O: data movement over the network is
  performed exclusively by the platform. Applications can describe the
  precise data needed at each stage, helping the provider schedule
  tasks and network transfers to reduce starvation. The design
  suggests an end-to-end argument for outsourced computing, shifting
  the service model from ``pay-for-effort'' to ``pay-for-results.''</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Exploitation of Secure ROS 2 Systems: A Proof-of-Concept on Autonomous Platform Compromise via Keystore Exfiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept supply chain attack against the Secure ROS 2 (SROS 2) framework, demonstrated on a Quanser QCar2 autonomous vehicle platform. A Trojan-infected Debian package modifies core ROS 2 security commands to exfiltrate newly generated keystore credentials via DNS in base64-encoded chunks to an attacker-controlled nameserver. Possession of these credentials enables the attacker to rejoin the SROS 2 network as an authenticated participant and publish spoofed control or perception messages without triggering authentication failures. We evaluate this capability on a secure ROS 2 Humble testbed configured for a four-stop-sign navigation routine using an Intel RealSense camera for perception. Experimental results show that control-topic injections can cause forced braking, sustained high-speed acceleration, and continuous turning loops, while perception-topic spoofing can induce phantom stop signs or suppress real detections. The attack generalizes to any data distribution service (DDS)-based robotic system using SROS 2, highlighting the need for both supply chain integrity controls and runtime semantic validation to safeguard autonomous systems against insider and impersonation threats.</description>

      <title>Fast Networks for High-Performance Distributed Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations increasingly need to collaborate by performing a computation on their combined dataset, while keeping their data hidden from each other. Certain kinds of collaboration, such as collaborative data analytics and AI, require a level of performance beyond what current cryptographic techniques for distributed trust can provide. This is because the organizations run software in different trust domains, which can require them to communicate over WANs or the public Internet. In this paper, we explore how to instead run such applications using fast datacenter-type LANs. We show that, by carefully redesigning distributed trust frameworks for LANs, we can achieve up to order-of-magnitude better performance than na\"ively using a LAN. Then, we develop deployment models for Distributed But Proximate Trust (DBPT) that allow parties to use a LAN while remaining physically and logically distinct. These developments make secure collaborative data analytics and AI significantly more practical and set new research directions for developing systems and cryptographic theory for high-performance distributed trust.</description>

      <title>LiteCUA: Computer as MCP Server for Computer-Use Agent on AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems.</description>
