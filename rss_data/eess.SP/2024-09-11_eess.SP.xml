      <title>In-ear ECG Signal Enhancement with Denoising Convolutional Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cardiac dipole has been shown to propagate to the ears, now a common site for consumer wearable electronics, enabling the recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, in-ear ECG recordings often suffer from significant noise due to their small amplitude and the presence of other physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), which complicates the extraction of cardiovascular features. This study addresses this issue by developing a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) to enhance ECG information from in-ear recordings, producing cleaner ECG outputs. The model is evaluated using a dataset of in-ear ECGs and corresponding clean Lead I ECGs from 45 healthy participants. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with a median increase of 5.9 dB. Additionally, the model significantly improved heart rate estimation accuracy, reducing the mean absolute error by almost 70% and increasing R-peak detection precision to a median value of 90%. We also trained and validated the model using a synthetic dataset, generated from real ECG signals, including abnormal cardiac morphologies, corrupted by pink noise. The results obtained show effective removal of noise sources with clinically plausible waveform reconstruction ability.</description>

      <title>Integration of Beyond Diagonal RIS and UAVs in 6G NTNs: Enhancing Aerial Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology shows great potential in sixth-generation (6G) terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) since it can effectively change wireless settings to improve connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on traditional RIS systems with diagonal phase response matrices. The straightforward RIS architecture, while cost-effective, has restricted capabilities in manipulating the wireless channels. The beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) greatly improves control over the wireless environment by utilizing interconnected phase response elements. This work proposes the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and BD-RIS in 6G NTNs, which has the potential to further enhance wireless coverage and spectral efficiency. We begin with the preliminaries of UAV communications and then discuss the fundamentals of BD-RIS technology. Subsequently, we discuss the potential of BD-RIS and UAV communications integration. We then proposed a case study based on UAV-mounted transmissive BD-RIS communication. Finally, we highlight future research directions and conclude this work.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Arrhythmia Classification using Smartwatch Photoplethysmography Signals Collected in Real-life Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most deep learning models of multiclass arrhythmia classification are tested on fingertip photoplethysmographic (PPG) data, which has higher signal-to-noise ratios compared to smartwatch-derived PPG, and the best reported sensitivity value for premature atrial/ventricular contraction (PAC/PVC) detection is only 75%. To improve upon PAC/PVC detection sensitivity while maintaining high AF detection, we use multi-modal data which incorporates 1D PPG, accelerometers, and heart rate data as the inputs to a computationally efficient 1D bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (1D-Bi-GRU) model to detect three arrhythmia classes. We used motion-artifact prone smartwatch PPG data from the NIH-funded Pulsewatch clinical trial. Our multimodal model tested on 72 subjects achieved an unprecedented 83% sensitivity for PAC/PVC detection while maintaining a high accuracy of 97.31% for AF detection. These results outperformed the best state-of-the-art model by 20.81% for PAC/PVC and 2.55% for AF detection even while our model was computationally more efficient (14 times lighter and 2.7 faster).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Placement and Power Allocation in Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surfaces for Enhanced Sensing and Communication Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the design of multiple reconfigurable intelligent sensing surfaces (RISSs) that enhance both communication and sensing tasks. An RISS incorporates additional active elements tailored to improve sensing accuracy. Our initial task involves optimizing placement of RISSs to mitigate signal interference. Subsequently, we establish power allocation schemes for sensing and communication within the system. Our final consideration involves examining how sensing results can be utilized to enhance communication, alongside an evaluation of communication performance under the impact of sensing inaccuracies. Numerical results reveal that the sensing task reaches its optimal performance with a finite number of RISSs, while the communication task exhibits enhanced performance with an increasing number of RISSs. Additionally, we identify an optimal communication spot under user movement.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Multi-Modal Edge-Computing System for Real-Time Kitchen Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the human activity recognition research area, prior studies predominantly concentrate on leveraging advanced algorithms on public datasets to enhance recognition performance, little attention has been paid to executing real-time kitchen activity recognition on energy-efficient, cost-effective edge devices. Besides, the prevalent approach of segregating data collection and context extraction across different devices escalates power usage, latency, and user privacy risks, impeding widespread adoption. This work presents a multi-modal wearable edge computing system for human activity recognition in real-time. Integrating six different sensors, ranging from inertial measurement units (IMUs) to thermal cameras, and two different microcontrollers, this system achieves end-to-end activity recognition, from data capture to context extraction, locally. Evaluation in an unmodified realistic kitchen validates its efficacy in recognizing fifteen activities, including a null class. Employing a compact machine learning model (184.5 kbytes) yields an average accuracy of 87.83 \%, with model inference completed in 25.26 ms on the microcontroller. Comparative analysis with alternative microcontrollers showcases power consumption and inference speed performance, demonstrating the proposed system's viability.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Full-Duplex Satellite Communications Aided by Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates a movable antenna (MA)-aided full-duplex (FD) satellite communication system, where the satellite, equipped with both transmit and receive MAs, serves multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) user terminals (UTs) in FD mode. Specifically, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem to minimize the UL and DL transmit powers under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. To jointly optimize the MA positions and transmit powers, we propose a two-loop particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a multiobjective optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible adjustments of MA positions can effectively reduce the total UL and DL transmit powers, while also alleviating the burden on self-interference (SI) cancellation modules.</description>

      <title>Source Enumeration using the Distribution of Angles: A Robust and Parameter-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source enumeration, the task of estimating the number of sources from the signal received by the array of antennas, is a critical problem in array signal processing. Numerous methods have been proposed to estimate the number of sources under white or colored Gaussian noise. However, their performance degrades significantly in the presence of a limited number of observations and/or a large number of sources. In this work, we propose a method based on the distribution of angles that performs well in (a) independent Gaussian, (b) spatially colored Gaussian, and (c) heavy-tailed noise, even when the number of sources is large. We support the supremacy of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods with extensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing based Detection Schemes for Differential Spatial Modulation in Visible Light Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential spatial modulation (DSM) exploits the time dimension to facilitate the differential modulation, which can perfectly avoid the challenge in acquiring of heavily entangled channel state information of visible light communication (VLC) system. However, it has huge search space and high complexity for large number of transmitters. In this paper, a novel vector correction (VC)-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) detection algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity, which exploits the sparsity and relativity of all transmitters, and then employs a novel correction criterion by correcting the index vectors of the error estimation for improving the demodulation performance. To overcome the local optimum dilemma in the atoms searching, an OMP-assisted genetic algorithm is also proposed to further improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the VLC-DSM system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the computational complexity at least by 62.5% while achieving an excellent BER performance as compared with traditional maximum likelihood based receiver.</description>

      <title>Self-calibrated Microring Weight Function for Neuromorphic Optical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a microring resonator-based weight function for neuromorphic photonic applications achieving a record-high precision of 11.3 bits and accuracy of 9.3 bits for 2 Gbps input optical signals. The system employs an all-analog self-referenced proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to perform real-time temperature stabilization within a range of up to 60 degree Celsius. A self-calibrated weight function is demonstrated for a range of 6 degree Celsius with a single initial calibration and minimal accuracy and precision degradation. By monitoring the through and drop ports of the microring with variable gain transimpedance amplifiers, accurate and precise weight adjustment is achieved, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. These findings underscore the system's robustness to dynamic thermal environments, highlighting the potential for high-speed reconfigurable analog photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Predictive Demodulation for Chaotic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic signals offer promising characteristics for wireless communications due to their wideband nature, low cross-correlation, and sensitivity to initial conditions. Although classical chaotic modulation schemes like Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) can theoretically match the performance of traditional modulation techniques (i.e., bit error rate), practical challenges, such as the difficulty in generating accurate signal replicas at the receiver, limit their effectiveness. Besides, chaotic signals are often considered unpredictable despite their deterministic nature. In this paper, we challenge this view by introducing a novel modulation scheme for chaotic communications that leverages the deterministic behavior of chaotic signals. The proposed approach eliminates the need for synchronized replicas of transmitted waveforms at the receiver. Moreover, to enhance noise robustness, we employ M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation on the chaotic samples. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms CSK when perfect replicas are unavailable, with the best performance achieved for low-order modulations, and resulting in minimal delay increase.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constrained neural networks for detection and localization of damage in metal plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with deep learning techniques applied to detection and localization of damage in a thin aluminum plate. We used data generated on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than 99% accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $3.14 \pm 0.21$ mm mean distance error and captured more than 60% of test examples within the diffraction limit. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Downlink Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cell-free massive MIMO systems with multiple distributed access points (APs) serving multiple users over the same time-frequency resources, downlink beamforming is done through spatial precoding. Precoding vectors can be optimally designed to use the minimum downlink transmit power while satisfying a quality-of-service requirement for each user. However, existing centralized solutions to beamforming optimization pose challenges such as high communication overhead and processing delay. On the other hand, distributed approaches either require data exchange over the network that scales with the number of antennas or solve the problem for cellular systems where every user is served by only one AP. In this paper, we formulate a multi-user beamforming optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power subject to per-user SINR requirements and propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. In our method, every AP solves an iterative optimization problem using its local channel state information. APs only need to share a real-valued vector of interference terms with the size of the number of users. Through simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm solves the optimization problem within tens of ADMM iterations and can effectively satisfy per-user SINR constraints.</description>

      <title>DeWinder: Single-Channel Wind Noise Reduction using Ultrasound Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of audio recordings in outdoor environments is often degraded by the presence of wind. Mitigating the impact of wind noise on the perceptual quality of single-channel speech remains a significant challenge due to its non-stationary characteristics. Prior work in noise suppression treats wind noise as a general background noise without explicit modeling of its characteristics. In this paper, we leverage ultrasound as an auxiliary modality to explicitly sense the airflow and characterize the wind noise. We propose a multi-modal deep-learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and speech signals for wind noise reduction. Our results show that DeWinder can significantly improve the noise reduction capabilities of state-of-the-art speech enhancement models.</description>

      <title>Rate-Constrained Quantization for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a common approach to mitigate the communication cost of federated learning (FL). In practice, the quantized local parameters are further encoded via an entropy coding technique, such as Huffman coding, for efficient data compression. In this case, the exact communication overhead is determined by the bit rate of the encoded gradients. Recognizing this fact, this work deviates from the existing approaches in the literature and develops a novel quantized FL framework, called \textbf{r}ate-\textbf{c}onstrained \textbf{fed}erated learning (RC-FED), in which the gradients are quantized subject to both fidelity and data rate constraints. We formulate this scheme, as a joint optimization in which the quantization distortion is minimized while the rate of encoded gradients is kept below a target threshold. This enables for a tunable trade-off between quantization distortion and communication cost. We analyze the convergence behavior of RC-FED, and show its superior performance against baseline quantized FL schemes on several datasets.</description>

      <title>Constructing an Interpretable Deep Denoiser by Unrolling Graph Laplacian Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06676</link>

Abstract: An image denoiser can be used for a wide range of restoration problems via the Plug-and-Play (PnP) architecture. In this paper, we propose a general framework to build an interpretable graph-based deep denoiser (GDD) by unrolling a solution to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem equipped with a graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) as signal prior. Leveraging a recent theorem showing that any (pseudo-)linear denoiser $\boldsymbol \Psi$, under mild conditions, can be mapped to a solution of a MAP denoising problem regularized using GLR, we first initialize a graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf L$ via truncated Taylor Series Expansion (TSE) of $\boldsymbol \Psi^{-1}$. Then, we compute the MAP linear system solution by unrolling iterations of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm into a sequence of neural layers as a feed-forward network -- one that is amenable to parameter tuning. The resulting GDD network is "graph-interpretable", low in parameter count, and easy to initialize thanks to $\mathbf L$ derived from a known well-performing denoiser $\boldsymbol \Psi$. Experimental results show that GDD achieves competitive image denoising performance compared to competitors, but employing far fewer parameters, and is more robust to covariate shift.</description>

      <title>Transmit and Receive Antenna Port Selection for Channel Capacity Maximization in Fluid-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a discrete optimization problem, namely, the maximization of channel capacity in fluid multiple-input multiple-output (fluid-MIMO) systems through the selection of antenna ports/positions at both the transmitter and the receiver. First, we present a new joint convex relaxation (JCR) problem by using an upper bound on the channel capacity and exploiting the binary nature of optimization variables. Then, we develop and analyze two optimization algorithms with different performance-complexity tradeoffs. The first algorithm is based on JCR and reduced exhaustive search (JCR&amp;RES), while the second on JCR and alternating optimization (JCR&amp;AO).</description>

      <title>Revisiting Trace Norm Minimization for Tensor Tucker Completion: A Direct Multilinear Rank Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently express tensor data using the Tucker format, a critical task is to minimize the multilinear rank such that the model would not be over-flexible and lead to overfitting. Due to the lack of rank minimization tools in tensor, existing works connect Tucker multilinear rank minimization to trace norm minimization of matrices unfolded from the tensor data. While these formulations try to exploit the common aim of identifying the low-dimensional structure of the tensor and matrix, this paper reveals that existing trace norm-based formulations in Tucker completion are inefficient in multilinear rank minimization. We further propose a new interpretation of Tucker format such that trace norm minimization is applied to the factor matrices of the equivalent representation, rather than some matrices unfolded from tensor data. Based on the newly established problem formulation, a fixed point iteration algorithm is proposed, and its convergence is proved. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed algorithm exhibits significant improved performance in terms of multilinear rank learning and consequently tensor signal recovery accuracy, compared to existing trace norm based Tucker completion methods.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Use of Raw Multispectral Earth Observation Imagery for Onboard Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, there is growing interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) on board Earth Observation (EO) satellites for time-critical applications, such as natural disaster response. However, the unavailability of raw satellite data currently hinders research on lightweight pre-processing techniques and limits the exploration of end-to-end pipelines, which could offer more efficient and accurate extraction of insights directly from the source data. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel methodology to automate the creation of datasets for the detection of target events (e.g., warm thermal hotspots) or objects (e.g., vessels) from Sentinel-2 raw data and other multispectral EO pushbroom raw imagery. The presented approach first processes the raw data by applying a pipeline consisting of spatial band registration and georeferencing of the raw data pixels. Then, it detects the target events by leveraging event-specific state-of-the-art algorithms on the Level-1C products, which are mosaicked and cropped on the georeferenced correspondent raw granule area. The detected events are finally re-projected back onto the corresponding raw images. We apply the proposed methodology to realize THRawS (Thermal Hotspots in Raw Sentinel-2 data), the first dataset of Sentinel-2 raw data containing warm thermal hotspots. THRawS includes 1090 samples containing wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and 33,335 event-free acquisitions to enable thermal hotspot detection and general classification applications. This dataset and associated toolkits provide the community with both an immediately useful resource as well as a framework and methodology acting as a template for future additions. With this work, we hope to pave the way for research on energy-efficient pre-processing algorithms and AI-based end-to-end processing systems on board EO satellites.</description>

      <title>Joint State and Sparse Input Estimation in Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsity constraints on the control inputs of a linear dynamical system naturally arise in several practical applications such as networked control, computer vision, seismic signal processing, and cyber-physical systems. In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating the states and sparse inputs of such systems from low-dimensional (compressive) measurements. Due to the low-dimensional measurements, conventional Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms fail to accurately estimate the states and inputs. We present a Bayesian approach that exploits the input sparsity to significantly improve estimation accuracy. Sparsity in the input estimates is promoted by using different prior distributions on the input. We investigate two main approaches: regularizer-based MAP, and {Bayesian learning-based estimation}. We also extend the approaches to handle control inputs with common support and analyze the time and memory complexities of the presented algorithms. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and time/memory complexities, especially in the low-dimensional measurement regime.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Massive MIMO: Precoding Design and Channel Estimation in the Electromagnetic Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output (RmMIMO) technology offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties, constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design. This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for antenna radiation patterns design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically, we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns, the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle Filter</title>

Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying the cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer the adversary's estimate of the target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like the inverse Kalman filter (I-KF), inverse extended KF (I-EKF), and inverse unscented KF (I-UKF). However, these filters typically assume additive Gaussian noise models and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. In contrast, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and presents the development of an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF to address scenarios where system information is unknown to the defender. Using the recursive Cramer-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different systems demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filter.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Graph Neural Networks is Robust to Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various tasks supported by their generalization capabilities. However, the current analysis of GNN generalization relies on the assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This imposes limitations on the cases where a model mismatch exists when generating testing data. In this paper, we examine GNNs that operate on geometric graphs generated from manifold models, explicitly focusing on scenarios where there is a mismatch between manifold models generating training and testing data. Our analysis reveals the robustness of the GNN generalization in the presence of such model mismatch. This indicates that GNNs trained on graphs generated from a manifold can still generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs generated from a mismatched manifold. We attribute this mismatch to both node feature perturbations and edge perturbations within the generated graph. Our findings indicate that the generalization gap decreases as the number of nodes grows in the training graph while increasing with larger manifold dimension as well as larger mismatch. Importantly, we observe a trade-off between the generalization of GNNs and the capability to discriminate high-frequency components when facing a model mismatch. The most important practical consequence of this analysis is to shed light on the filter design of generalizable GNNs robust to model mismatch. We verify our theoretical findings with experiments on multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>GET-UP: GEomeTric-aware Depth Estimation with Radar Points UPsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's 3D surroundings. Radar, with its robustness to adverse weather conditions and capability to measure distances, has drawn significant interest for radar-camera depth estimation. However, existing algorithms process the inherently noisy and sparse radar data by projecting 3D points onto the image plane for pixel-level feature extraction, overlooking the valuable geometric information contained within the radar point cloud. To address this gap, we propose GET-UP, leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exchange and aggregate both 2D and 3D information from radar data. This approach effectively enriches the feature representation by incorporating spatial relationships compared to traditional methods that rely only on 2D feature extraction. Furthermore, we incorporate a point cloud upsampling task to densify the radar point cloud, rectify point positions, and derive additional 3D features under the guidance of lidar data. Finally, we fuse radar and camera features during the decoding phase for depth estimation. We benchmark our proposed GET-UP on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 15.3% and 14.7% improvement in MAE and RMSE over the previously best-performing model.
