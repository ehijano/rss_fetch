      <title>A parameterized linear formulation of the integer hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ be an integer matrix with components bounded by $\Delta$ in absolute value. Cook et al.~(1986) have shown that there exists a universal matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{m' \times n}$ with the following property: For each $b \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, there exists $t \in \mathbb{Z}^{m'}$ such that the integer hull of the polyhedron $P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Ax \leq b\}$ is described by $P_I = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Bx \leq t\}$. Our \emph{main result} is that $t$ is an \emph{affine} function of $b$ as long as $b$ is from a fixed equivalence class of the lattice $D \cdot \mathbb{Z}^m$. Here $D \in \mathbb{N}$ is a number that depends on $n$ and $\Delta$ only. Furthermore, $D$ as well as the matrix $B$ can be computed in time depending on $\Delta$ and $n$ only. An application of this result is the solution of an open problem posed by Cslovjecsek et al.~(SODA 2024) concerning the complexity of \emph{2-stage-stochastic integer programming} problems. The main tool of our proof is the classical theory of \emph{Gomory-Chv\'atal cutting planes} and the \emph{elementary closure} of rational polyhedra.</description>

      <title>New Pseudorandom Generators and Correlation Bounds Using Extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new correlation bounds and pseudorandom generators for a collection of computation models. These models are all natural generalizations of structured low-degree $F_2$-polynomials that we did not have correlation bounds for before. In particular:
  1. We construct a PRG for width-2 $poly(n)$-length branching programs which read $d$ bits at a time with seed length $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}\cdot d^2\log^2(1/\epsilon)$. This comes quadratically close to optimal dependence in $d$ and $\log(1/\epsilon)$. The previous PRG by Bogdanov, Dvir, Verbin, and Yehudayoff had an exponentially worse dependence on $d$ with seed length of $O(d\log n + d2^d\log(1/\epsilon))$.
  2. We provide correlation bounds and PRGs against size-$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ AC0 circuits with either $n^{.99}$ SYM gates (computing an arbitrary symmetric function) or $n^{.49}$ THR gates (computing an arbitrary linear threshold function). Previous work of Servedio and Tan only handled $n^{.49}$ SYM gates or $n^{.24}$ THR gates, and previous work of Lovett and Srinivasan only handled polysize circuits.
  3. We give exponentially small correlation bounds against degree-$n^{O(1)}$ $F_2$-polynomials set-multilinear over some partition of the input into $n^{.99}$ parts (noting that at $n$ parts, we recover all low-degree polynomials). This generalizes correlation bounds against degree-$(d-1)$ polynomials which are set-multilinear over a fixed partition into $d$ blocks, which were established by Bhrushundi, Harsha, Hatami, Kopparty and Kumar.
  The common technique behind all of these results is to fortify a hard function with the right type of extractor to obtain stronger correlation bounds. Although this technique has been used in previous work, it relies on the model shrinking to a very small class under random restrictions. Our results show such fortification can be done even for classes that do not enjoy such behavior.</description>

      <title>Local Enumeration: The Not-All-Equal Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gurumukhani et al. (CCC'24) proposed the local enumeration problem Enum(k, t) as an approach to break the Super Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SSETH): for a natural number $k$ and a parameter $t$, given an $n$-variate $k$-CNF with no satisfying assignment of Hamming weight less than $t(n)$, enumerate all satisfying assignments of Hamming weight exactly $t(n)$. Furthermore, they gave a randomized algorithm for Enum(k, t) and employed new ideas to analyze the first non-trivial case, namely $k = 3$. In particular, they solved Enum(3, n/2) in expected $1.598^n$ time. A simple construction shows a lower bound of $6^{\frac{n}{4}} \approx 1.565^n$.
  In this paper, we show that to break SSETH, it is sufficient to consider a simpler local enumeration problem NAE-Enum(k, t): for a natural number $k$ and a parameter $t$, given an $n$-variate $k$-CNF with no satisfying assignment of Hamming weight less than $t(n)$, enumerate all Not-All-Equal (NAE) solutions of Hamming weight exactly $t(n)$, i.e., those that satisfy and falsify some literal in every clause. We refine the algorithm of Gurumukhani et al. and show that it optimally solves NAE-Enum(3, n/2), namely, in expected time $poly(n) \cdot 6^{\frac{n}{4}}$.</description>

      <title>Collision-resistant hash-shuffles on the reals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oneway real functions are effective maps on positive-measure sets of reals that preserve randomness and have no effective probabilistic inversions. We construct a oneway real function which is collision-resistant: the probability of effectively producing distinct reals with the same image is zero, and each real has uncountable inverse image.</description>

      <title>On the Chow-rank of the permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Glynn's formula from Ryser's formula for the permanent. We further establish via an orbital argument that Glynn's formula yields an optimal row-homogeneous Chow-decomposition of the permanent. We introduce a method for upper-bounding the Chow-rank of polynomials. Our method is based upon the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials. Finally we derive a parametric description of rank revealing row-homogeneous Chow-decompositions of the permanent. Our result provides an alternative approach to the parametrization first obtained by Glynn.</description>

      <title>The membership problem for constant-sized quantum correlations is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and from undecidability results of the third author for linear system nonlocal games.</description>

      <title>Computing Subset Vertex Covers in $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural generalization of Vertex Cover: the Subset Vertex Cover problem, which is to decide for a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $T\subseteq V$ and integer $k$, if $V$ has a subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $S$ contains at least one end-vertex of every edge incident to a vertex of $T$. A graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\neq$ NP). We also prove new polynomial time results, some of which follow from a reduction to Vertex Cover restricted to classes of probe graphs. We first give a dichotomy on graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H=sP_1+tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1+P_2+P_3)$-free graphs and bounded mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Complexity Classification of Product State Problems for Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product states, unentangled tensor products of single qubits, are a ubiquitous ansatz in quantum computation, including for state-of-the-art Hamiltonian approximation algorithms. A natural question is whether we should expect to efficiently solve product state problems on any interesting families of Hamiltonians.
  We completely classify the complexity of finding minimum-energy product states for Hamiltonians defined by any fixed set of allowed 2-qubit interactions. Our results follow a line of work classifying the complexity of solving Hamiltonian problems and classical constraint satisfaction problems based on the allowed constraints. We prove that estimating the minimum energy of a product state is in P if and only if all allowed interactions are 1-local, and NP-complete otherwise. Equivalently, any family of non-trivial two-body interactions generates Hamiltonians with NP-complete product-state problems. Our hardness constructions only require coupling strengths of constant magnitude.
  A crucial component of our proofs is a collection of hardness results for a new variant of the Vector Max-Cut problem, which should be of independent interest. Our definition involves sums of distances rather than squared distances and allows linear stretches.
  We similarly give a proof that the original Vector Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in 3 dimensions. This implies that optimizing over product states for Quantum Max-Cut (the quantum Heisenberg model) is NP-complete, even when every term is guaranteed to have positive unit weight.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>
