      <title>Towards Real-Time Neural Volumetric Rendering on Mobile Devices: A Measurement Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is an emerging technique to synthesize 3D objects from 2D images with a wide range of potential applications. However, rendering existing NeRF models is extremely computation intensive, making it challenging to support real-time interaction on mobile devices. In this paper, we take the first initiative to examine the state-of-the-art real-time NeRF rendering technique from a system perspective. We first define the entire working pipeline of the NeRF serving system. We then identify possible control knobs that are critical to the system from the communication, computation, and visual performance perspective. Furthermore, an extensive measurement study is conducted to reveal the effects of these control knobs on system performance. Our measurement results reveal that different control knobs contribute differently towards improving the system performance, with the mesh granularity being the most effective knob and the quantization being the least effective knob. In addition, diverse hardware device settings and network conditions have to be considered to fully unleash the benefit of operating under the appropriate knobs</description>

      <title>UBiSS: A Unified Framework for Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the surge in the amount of video data, video summarization techniques, including visual-modal(VM) and textual-modal(TM) summarization, are attracting more and more attention. However, unimodal summarization inevitably loses the rich semantics of the video. In this paper, we focus on a more comprehensive video summarization task named Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos (BiSSV). Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset, BIDS, in (video, VM-Summary, TM-Summary) triplet format. Unlike traditional processing methods, our construction procedure contains a VM-Summary extraction algorithm aiming to preserve the most salient content within long videos. Based on BIDS, we propose a Unified framework UBiSS for the BiSSV task, which models the saliency information in the video and generates a TM-summary and VM-summary simultaneously. We further optimize our model with a list-wise ranking-based objective to improve its capacity to capture highlights. Lastly, we propose a metric, $NDCG_{MS}$, to provide a joint evaluation of the bimodal summary. Experiments show that our unified framework achieves better performance than multi-stage summarization pipelines. Code and data are available at https://github.com/MeiYutingg/UBiSS.</description>

      <title>Archiving Body Movements: Collective Generation of Chinese Calligraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a communication channel, body movements have been widely explored in behavioral studies and kinesics. Performing and visual arts share the same interests but focus on documenting and representing human body movements, such as for dance notation and visual work creation. This paper investigates body movements in oriental calligraphy and how to apply calligraphy principles to stimulate and archive body movements. Through an artwork (Wushu), the authors experiment with an interactive and generative approach to engage the audience's bodily participation and archive the body movements as a compendium of generated calligraphy. The audience assumes the role of both writers and readers; creating ("writing") and appreciating ("reading") the generated calligraphy becomes a cyclical process within this infinite "Book," which can motivate further attention and discussions concerning Chinese characters and calligraphy.</description>

      <title>ConsistencyTTA: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Text-to-Audio Generation with Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are instrumental in text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Unfortunately, they suffer from slow inference due to an excessive number of queries to the underlying denoising network per generation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce ConsistencyTTA, a framework requiring only a single non-autoregressive network query, thereby accelerating TTA by hundreds of times. We achieve so by proposing "CFG-aware latent consistency model," which adapts consistency generation into a latent space and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) into model training. Moreover, unlike diffusion models, ConsistencyTTA can be finetuned closed-loop with audio-space text-aware metrics, such as CLAP score, to further enhance the generations. Our objective and subjective evaluation on the AudioCaps dataset shows that compared to diffusion-based counterparts, ConsistencyTTA reduces inference computation by 400x while retaining generation quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models, Image Super-Resolution And Everything: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have disrupted the image Super-Resolution (SR) field and further closed the gap between image quality and human perceptual preferences. They are easy to train and can produce very high-quality samples that exceed the realism of those produced by previous generative methods. Despite their promising results, they also come with new challenges that need further research: high computational demands, comparability, lack of explainability, color shifts, and more. Unfortunately, entry into this field is overwhelming because of the abundance of publications. To address this, we provide a unified recount of the theoretical foundations underlying DMs applied to image SR and offer a detailed analysis that underscores the unique characteristics and methodologies within this domain, distinct from broader existing reviews in the field. This survey articulates a cohesive understanding of DM principles and explores current research avenues, including alternative input domains, conditioning techniques, guidance mechanisms, corruption spaces, and zero-shot learning approaches. By offering a detailed examination of the evolution and current trends in image SR through the lens of DMs, this survey sheds light on the existing challenges and charts potential future directions, aiming to inspire further innovation in this rapidly advancing area.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Bench: Evaluating and Improving Compositional Text-to-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We will release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</description>
