      <title>Harnessing quantum chaos in spin-boson models for all-purpose quantum-enhanced sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum chaos has immense potential as a tool to accelerate the preparation of entangled states and overcome challenges due to decoherence and technical noise. Here, we study how chaos in the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the uniform coupling of an ensemble of qubits to a common bosonic mode, can enable the rapid generation of non-Gaussian entangled spin-boson states without fine tuning of system parameters or initial conditions. However, the complexity of these states means that unlocking their utility for quantum-enhanced sensing with standard protocols would require the measurement of complex or typically inaccessible observables. To address this challenge, we develop a sensing scheme based on interaction-based readout that enable us to implement near-optimal quantum-enhanced metrology of global spin rotations or bosonic dipslacements using only spin measurements. We show that our approach is robust to technical noise and imperfections and thus opens new opportunities to exploit complex entangled states generated by chaotic dynamics in current quantum science platforms such as trapped-ion and cavity-QED experiments.</description>

      <title>Distance Form Factor of a Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and a Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a distance form factor (DFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the DFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the DFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The DFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the DFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The DFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process.</description>

      <title>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Interaction driven topological phase transitions of hardcore bosons on a two-leg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of hardcore bosons possessing nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions on a two-leg ladder. We show that by allowing nearest neighbour dimerized interactions instead of hopping dimerization, the system exhibits topological phases and phase transitions under proper conditions. First, by assuming uniform hopping throughout the ladder, we show that when interaction along the legs are dimerized and the dimerization pattern is different in the legs, a trivial rung-Mott insulator to a topological bond order phase transition occurs as a function of the dimerization strength. However, for a fixed dimerization strength, the system exhibits a topological to trivial phase transition with increase in the rung hopping. A completely different scenario appears when the rung interaction is turned on. We obtain that for a ladder with uniform hopping, the repulsive interaction either turns the topological phase into a trivial rung-Mott insulator or a charge density wave phase. Such topological features are absent when the dimerization pattern in the nearest neighbour interaction is considered to be identical in both the legs of the ladder. We numerically obtain the ground state properties and also show the signatures of topological phase transitions through Thouless charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Universal clusters in quasi-two-dimensional ultracold Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study universal clusters in quasi-two dimensions (q2D) that consist of a light (L) atom interacting with two or three heavy (H) identical fermions, forming the trimer or tetramer bound state. The axial confinement in q2D is shown to lift the three-fold degeneracy of 3D trimer (tetramer) in $p$-wave channel and uniquely select the ground state with magnetic angular momentum $|m|=1$ ($m=0$). By varying the interaction or confinement strength, we explore the dimensional crossover of these clusters from 3D to 2D, characterized by a gradual change of critical H-L mass ratio for their emergence and momentum-space distribution. Importantly, we find that a finite effective range will {\it not} alter their critical mass ratios in the weak coupling regime. There, we establish an effective 2D model to quantitatively reproduce the properties of q2D clusters, and further identify the optimal interaction strengths for their detections in experiments. Our results suggest a promising prospect for observing universal clusters and associated high-order correlation effects in realistic q2D ultracold Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas in the Random Phase Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>

      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>
