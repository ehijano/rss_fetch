      <title>Proceedings of Direct photon measurement in small systems and thermal radiation from QGP with ALICE, Hard Probes conference 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic probes are a unique tool for studying the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Dielectrons are emitted during the entire evolution of the medium created in such collisions, allowing the extraction of the real direct photon fraction at vanishing mass and providing access to thermal radiation from the early hot stages of the collision. The measurement of dielectron and direct-photon production in minimum-bias pp collisions serves as a crucial baseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions, whereas pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities allow the search for the possible presence of QGP in small systems. An overview of the final results of dielectron production in pp at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and in central \PbPb collisions at \fivenn measured by ALICE is presented, together with their implications for the production of thermal radiation. Finally, an outlook on future measurements is given with the first performance studies from Run 3.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order proton cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations measured in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC reports new measurements of jet quenching based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in pp and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, for triggers in the range $9&lt;E_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}&lt;20$ GeV. The datasets have integrated luminosities of 3.9$ {\rm nb}^{-1}$ for Au+Au and 23$ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ for pp collisions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. The large uncorrelated jet background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed-event approach, which enables precise charged-particle jet measurements at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}$ and large $R$. Recoil-jet distributions are reported in the range $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}&lt;25$ \gev. Comparison of the distributions measured in pp and Au+Au collisions reveals strong medium-induced jet yield suppression for $R=0.2$, with markedly less suppression for $R=0.5$. Comparison is also made to theoretical models incorporating jet quenching. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying jet quenching and the angular dependence of medium-induced jet-energy transport, and provide new constraints on modelling such effects.</description>

      <title>First experimental test of the ratio method for nuclear-reaction analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear halos are very exotic quantal structures observed far from stability. Because of their short lifetime, they are mostly studied through reactions. The ratio method offers a new observable: the ratio of angular differential cross sections for breakup and scattering. It is predicted to be much more sensitive to the projectile structure than individual cross sections thanks to its independence of the reaction process. We test this new observable experimentally for the first time considering the collision of 11Be on C at 22.8 MeV/nucleon. We extend this analysis to similar data recently measured on Pb at 19.1 MeV/nucleon. Both analyses confirm the theoretical predictions, which opens the door to a new era in the study of nuclear structure near the neutron dripline. This should prove invaluable in conjunction with the start of FRIB. The ratio method could also be extended to other fields of quantum physics beyond nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ $\beta$ decay studies at GANIL and upcoming opportunities with DESIR and S$^3$-LEB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Corrected transition rates ($\mathcal{F}t^{0^+ \rightarrow 0^+}$) of $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ superallowed $\beta$ decays currently give the most precise value of $V_{ud}$, the dominant term of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix. By setting stringent constrains on the CKM unitarity, these decays allow probing physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector. A recent global reevaluation of the $\mathcal{F}t^{0^+ \rightarrow 0^+}$ values has indicated a violation of CKM unitarity prompting reassessment of the theoretical radiative and isospin symmetry breaking corrections applied on the experimental transition rates $ft$. In this article we briefly discuss this current situation and the experimental program at GANIL geared towards constraining isospin symmetry breaking corrections. We conclude by presenting the opportunities that will be available at DESIR and S$^3$-LEB, the upcoming low-energy radioactive ion beam facilities at GANIL.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of MOSS For The ALICE ITS3 For The LHC Run 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ALICE, one of the four main CERN LHC experiments, studies heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. For LHC Run 4 (starting 2030), ALICE will replace the three innermost cylindrical layers of its inner tracking system during Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2029). The new ITS3 will enhance pointing resolution by a factor of two and improve tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum (pT &lt; 0.3 GeV/c). It will feature ultra-thin (&lt; 50 micrometer), stitched wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) using 65 nm CMOS imaging technology. These sensors can be bent, forming a truly cylindrical barrel with an innermost radius of 19 mm and an average material budget of 0.09 X/X0 per layer. ITS3 development involves cutting-edge R&amp;D, including MAPS production in 65 nm CMOS, stitched wafer-scale fabrication, ultra-light mechanics, and a novel air cooling system. The 65 nm CMOS technology was validated using Multi-Layer Reticle 1 test structures. In mid-2023, the first stitched prototypes, MOnolithic Stitched Sensors (MOSS), were produced to demonstrate stitching feasibility and assess wafer-scale sensor yield and performance. Each MOSS chip (1.4 cm x 25.9 cm) contains 6.7 million pixels across 10 repeated sensor units, each with 8 pixel matrices: top matrices (256 x 256 pixels, 22.5 micrometer pitch) and bottom matrices (320 x 320 pixels, 18 micrometer pitch). These layouts help evaluate yield variations based on density and spacing. This work presents results from MOSS characterization, including power domain impedance, DAC performance, pixel readout, threshold, and fake-hit rate scans. Beam and lab tests confirmed an efficiency &gt;99% and a Fake Hit Rate lower than 0.1 pixel-1 s-1, meeting ITS3 requirements for Run 4.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric analysis for long-baseline neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show, for the example of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction. We show that the spectral functions of target nuclei play an essential role not only for the initial neutrino-nucleus interaction but also for the final state evolution.</description>
