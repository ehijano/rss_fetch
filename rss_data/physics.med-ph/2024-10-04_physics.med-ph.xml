      <title>Dynamical cross-correlations between RR and QT intervals in long-term electrocardiogram recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between RR and QT intervals is crucial for interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and managing cardiac conditions. We investigated cross-correlation between RR and QT intervals in long-term ECG recordings from 202 healthy subjects using time-lagged cross-correlation analysis to explore how QT intervals correlate with both preceding and succeeding RR intervals across various time lags. Data was preprocessed with the smoothness priors method to remove long-term trends while preserving relevant short-term dynamics.
  Our results reveal that, as expected, the highest RR-QT cross-correlations occur when the intervals overlap the most. Notably, we also observed a strong cross-correlation between the present QT interval and the preceding RR interval, with the overall correlations skewed toward negative lags. This suggests that past RR intervals exert a stronger influence on current QT intervals. These findings align with previous research on RR-QT transfer entropy.
  We found no significant differences in RR-QT cross-correlations between sexes. However, aging was associated with significantly reduced cross-correlations across all lags. This effect is consistent with existing literature on age-related cardiac changes and provides further insight into the impact of aging on RR-QT coupling. Additionally, we observed a slight positive correlation between heart rate and cross-correlation at all lags, with cross-correlation decreasing as the lag increased. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamic RR-QT relationship and may inform future studies on cardiac electrophysiology and diseases.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the Plan Aperture Modulation of Radiotherapy Treatment Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel metric, Plan Aperture Modulation (PAM), developed to quantify the modulation of radiotherapy treatment plans. PAM aims to provide a clear geometric interpretation, addressing the limitations of previous complexity metrics and facilitating its integration into treatment planning systems (TPSs) and clinical workflows. The PAM metric was defined as the average fraction of the target area outside the beam aperture, weighted over all control points in a treatment plan. The metric was evaluated in VMAT plans for two sites: prostate with lymph nodes and lung SBRT. Plans with varying complexities were generated using the Eclipse TPS, and PAM was compared to established metrics, including Plan Modulation (PM), Modulation Complexity Score (MCS), and monitor units per Gray (MU/Gy). The relationship between PAM and the Modulation Factor (MF), which quantifies the increase in MUs due to plan modulation, was also investigated. PAM provided a more intuitive assessment of plan modulation compared to the other metrics, and was validated across different delivery systems, such as C-arm linacs and Halcyon systems. The metric outperformed the previous metrics, indicated a zero modulation for Dynamic Conformal Arc plans, and was independent of confounding variables, such as treatment technique, beam energy, delivery system, and patient anatomy. Derived equations enabled the calculation of MF based on PAM, allowing for a robust quantification of plan modulation. PAM is a robust and intuitive metric for quantifying modulation in radiotherapy plans. It overcomes the limitations of previous metrics and can be readily implemented in TPSs to control plan modulation during optimization and for reporting. PAM is a promising tool for improving treatment planning workflows and for comparing and benchmarking radiotherapy plans in multi-institutional studies, clinical trials, and audits.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the two-voltage method for parallel-plate ionization chambers irradiated with pulsed beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-vented ionization chambers exposed to clinical radiation beams may suffer from recombination during the drift of the charge carriers towards the electrodes. Thus, dosimetry protocols recommend the use of a correction factor, usually denominated saturation factor ($k_{\rm sat}$), to correct the ionization chamber readout for the incomplete collection of charge. The two-voltage method is the recommended methodology for the calculation of the saturation factor, however, it is based on the early Boag model, which only takes into account the presence of positive and negative ions in the ionization chamber and does not account for the electric field screening or the free electron contribution to the signal.
  The numerical simulation shows a better agreement with the experimental data than the current analytical theories in terms of charge collection efficiency. The classical two-voltage method, systematically overestimates the saturation factor, with differences increasing with dose per pulse also present at low dose per pulse. These results may have implications for the dosimetry with ionization chambers in therapy modalities that use a dose per pulse higher than conventional radiotherapy such as intraoperative radiotherapy but also in conventional dose per pulse for ionization chambers that suffer from significant charge recombination.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional materials as ideal substrates for molecular quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical light states is central to emerging quantum technologies. Color centers in insulating crystals have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first principles calculations to investigate the photoemission spectrum of organic molecules adsorbed on various 2D materials. Machine learning interatomic potentials are combined with density functional theory to accelerate the search for stable adsorption configurations. The calculated zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes show excellent agreement with experiments. Our results indicate that the 2D substrate couples weakly to the molecular transitions and that emission characteristics are almost universal across different substrates. The unique effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce a sharp sideband(s) near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational and translational modes of the molecule.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Breast Region Segmentation with a Novel Breast Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Segmentation of the breast region in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for the automatic measurement of breast density and the quantitative analysis of imaging findings. This study aims to compare various deep learning methods to enhance whole breast segmentation and reduce computational costs as well as environmental effect for future research.
  Methods: We collected fifty-nine DCE-MRI scans from Stavanger University Hospital and, after preprocessing, analyzed fifty-eight scans. The preprocessing steps involved standardizing imaging protocols and resampling slices to ensure consistent volume across all patients. Using our novel approach, we defined new breast boundaries and generated corresponding segmentation masks. We evaluated seven deep learning models for segmentation namely UNet, UNet++, DenseNet, FCNResNet50, FCNResNet101, DeepLabv3ResNet50, and DeepLabv3ResNet101. To ensure robust model validation, we employed 10-fold cross-validation, dividing the dataset into ten subsets, training on nine, and validating on the remaining one, rotating this process to use all subsets for validation.
  Results: The models demonstrated significant potential across multiple metrics. UNet++ achieved the highest performance in Dice score, while UNet excelled in validation and generalizability. FCNResNet50, notable for its lower carbon footprint and reasonable inference time, emerged as a robust model following UNet++. In boundary detection, both UNet and UNet++ outperformed other models, with DeepLabv3ResNet also delivering competitive results.</description>

      <title>A method for testing handgun bullets in deer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702107</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0702107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   Using service handguns to test bullets in deer is problematic because of velocity loss with range and accuracy giving sub-optimal shot placement. An alternate method is presented using a scoped muzzleloader shooting saboted handgun bullets to allow precise (within 2" in many cases) shot placement for studying terminal ballistics in a living target. Deer are baited to a known range and path obstructions are used to place the deer broadside to the shooter. Muzzleloading powder charges provide a combination of muzzle velocity and velocity loss due to air resistance for a given ballistic coefficient that produce impact velocities corresponding to typical pistol velocities. With readily available sabots, this approach allows for testing of terminal ballistics of .355, .357, .40, .429, .45, and .458 caliber bullets with two muzzleloaders (.45 and .50 caliber). Examples are described demonstrating the usefulness of testing handgun bullets in deer for acoustic shooting event reconstruction, understanding tissue damage effects, and comparing relative incapacitation of different loads.</description>

      <title>Physics-Regularized Multi-Modal Image Assimilation for Brain Tumor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical models in the form of partial differential equations represent an important prior for many under-constrained problems. One example is tumor treatment planning, which heavily depends on accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of tumor cells in a patient's anatomy. Medical imaging scans can identify the bulk of the tumor, but they cannot reveal its full spatial distribution. Tumor cells at low concentrations remain undetectable, for example, in the most frequent type of primary brain tumors, glioblastoma. Deep-learning-based approaches fail to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of reliable training data. Most existing works therefore rely on physics-based simulations to match observed tumors, providing anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches struggle with complex and unknown initial conditions and are limited by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we present a novel method that balances data-driven and physics-based cost functions. In particular, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies the adherence of our learned spatiotemporal tumor and brain tissue distributions to their corresponding growth and elasticity equations. This quantification, serving as a regularization term rather than a hard constraint, enables greater flexibility and proficiency in assimilating patient data than existing models. We demonstrate improved coverage of tumor recurrence areas compared to existing techniques on real-world data from a cohort of patients. The method holds the potential to enhance clinical adoption of model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma.</description>
