      <title>Fully Generalized Spin Models with Strain Effects of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ spin model-originally derived for an ideal $P\bar{3}1m$ symmetric geometry-has long served as a central framework for understanding candidate Kitaev materials. In realistic crystals, however, this ideal geometry is seldom realized, either at low temperatures or under external perturbations, limiting the model's quantitative applicability. Here we introduce a fully generalized spin model, denoted $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$, that explicitly incorporates arbitrary lattice deformations $\epsilon$. All spin-exchange interactions and their strain-dependent coefficients are obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and a microscopic derivation of coupling constants for materials based on $d^5$ transition-metal ions. For $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under a strain of $3\%$, new emergent exchange channels acquire magnitudes comparable to their unstrained counterparts. Building on these parameters, we investigate strain-driven quantum phase transitions between competing magnetic states-including the zigzag order and the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL)-and identify a strain-induced topological transition within the KQSL states that offers a practical diagnostic of Kitaev physics. Furthermore, our symmetry analysis of the $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ model is applicable to both $d^{5}$ ions, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and $d^{7}$ systems, including cobalt-based compounds.</description>

      <title>Instantons and topological order in two-leg electron ladders: A universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our numerical study of the disordered Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping shows that a two-leg electron ladder has a finite topological entanglement entropy in the regime where the density of states exhibits an exponentially decaying gap. The value of the topological entanglement entropy suggests that two-leg ladders belong to the same universality class as graphene zigzag nanoribbons, despite several structural differences. A Shankar-Witten-type bosonization Lagrangian with disorder captures several features of the numerically obtained results for disordered two-leg ladders. Additionally, we propose a Lagrangian in which the fusion of two semions residing on different chains generates a fermion (instanton). We apply this Lagrangian within the framework of the pinned charge-density-wave model and compute the relevant Green's function using the bosonization method. This approach predicts a linear density of states at a critical disorder strength. Below this threshold, a soft gap emerges, which is in qualitative agreement with our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall effects and Hall crystals at fractional filling of helical trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moir\'e system in which anomalous Hall effects have been recently observed at integer and fractional fillings. Focusing on helical trilayers near the magic angle and under a substrate potential, we demonstrate that an isolated higher Chern band with Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ emerges, enabling the exploration of many-body states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. We use exact diagonalization to predict a rich phase diagram of gapped states unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$, we identify a quantum Hall crystal with integer Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$ coexisting with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave order. At $\nu=1/2$, we find a quantum Hall pseudospin ferromagnet featuring extensive ground state degeneracy, Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$, and $2\times 2$ charge order. Finally, at $\nu=1/3$ we find a translation-symmetric fractional Chern insulator with $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$. By incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$, where three flavors are fully filled, leaving the fourth at partial filling $\nu$. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic parameter regimes away from the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, tuning the electron-scattering mechanisms beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also new perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Probing quasiparticle excitations in a doped Mott insulator via Friedel oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate impurity-induced Friedel oscillations in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model, focusing on the role of holon and doublon excitations. We show that weak impurities, due to the non-fermionic nature of the underlying quasiparticles, induce Friedel oscillations whose behavior is consistent with an effective non-interacting theory for these quasiparticles, and whose wavevector reflects the violation of Luttinger's theorem. At larger impurity strength, the system transitions to a phase-separated state composed of coexisting Mott-insulating (half-filled) and hole-rich regions. Within the composite operator framework, this phase separation arises from a competition between the kinetic energy of holons and the tendency to form tightly bound holon-doublon pairs. Our results offer new insights into the nature of charge carriers and the emergent electronic phases in the doped Mott regime.</description>

      <title>Emergent boundary supersymmetry in a one dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between bulk properties and boundary conditions in one-dimensional quantum systems, gives rise to many intriguing phenomena. These include the emergence of zero energy modes which are of significant interest to a variety of fields. In this work we investigate the presence of such zero modes in cases where the boundary conditions are dynamical and arise due to the coupling to some quantum degrees of freedom. In particular, we study a one-dimensional spin-singlet superconductor, modeled by the Gross-Neveu field theory, coupled to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic impurities at its boundaries via a spin-exchange interaction. We solve the model exactly for arbitrary values of the bulk and the impurity coupling strengths using nested coordinate Bethe ansatz and show that the system exhibits a rich boundary phase structure. For a range of couplings, the low energy degrees of freedom form irreducible representations of the supersymmetric $spl(2,1)\otimes spl(2,1)$ algebra which become degenerate at a specific point, indicating the emergence of supersymmetry in the low energy boundary degrees of freedom. We show that at the supersymmetric point there exist exact zero energy modes that map one ground state with the other. We express these in terms of the generators of the algebra.</description>

      <title>Nematicity in iron pnictides: phase competition and emergent symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of iron-based superconductors contains a host of electronic orders, which are intimately connected with their superconductivity. Here we analyze the fluctuations of one type of nematic order in another. Our analysis leads to an emergent U(1) symmetry at a first-order transition between a nematic phase and a $C_4$-symmetric charge-ordered phase. We characterize the continuous symmetry in terms of a certain hidden Lie algebra that links the different orders. This emergent symmetry leads to a Goldstone mode at the transition and causes softening of excitations in the nematic and charge sectors near the transition. The underlying physics bears a resemblance to the anisotropic XZ spin model, with the nematic order and charge $C_4$ order parameters playing the roles of the $x$ and $z$ components of the magnetization vector, respectively. We provide the experimental evidence in support of the proposed effects, and discuss the general implications of our results for the physics of iron-based superconductors and other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07750v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter Induced in Optically Driven Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside it. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new non-equilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal step-like structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that red-shifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this step-like potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is red shifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a disordered superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity, we construct the non-equilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</description>

      <title>Variation of Bose surface by Filling in Cooper pair Bose metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) is a non-superfluid quantum phase in which uncondensed fermion pairs form a "Bose surface" in momentum space. We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n &gt; 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Frustrated vacancy ordering creates novel quantum properties in Kutinaite, $\mathrm{Ag}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{14.4}\mathrm{As}_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal crystals are fully ordered, but real-world crystals always contain defects breaking translational symmetry. Random defects in crystals have important implications and they e.g. provide the foundation for semiconductor-based electronic devices. Structurally correlated defects introduce an additional level of complexity, which may lead to novel materials properties, but rationalization of relations between correlated disorder and the emergent material properties are very rare. Here we report that the defect structure of the mineral Kutinaite, Ag6Cu14.4As7, exhibits unprecedented metallic diamagnetism, a hallmark of non-trivial electronic states that require delicate symmetrical protection. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methodologies, simulations, and physical property measurements, we deduced and verified subtle frustrated vacancy ordering of the Cu sublattice when cooling crystals below ~300 K. The vacancy frustration in Kutinaite leads to unique quantum properties, and our study calls for a reconsideration of the role of vacancies as quasi-chemical species in crystals.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth &amp; Physical Property Characterization of Mixed Topological Insulator BiSbTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline mixed topological insulator (TI) BiSbTe$_3$ and its detailed structural and magneto-transport properties. The single crystalline samples of BiSbTe$_3$ are grown by the melt-growth process and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and Raman spectroscopy. The single crystal XRD peaks dictated the growth direction along the c-axis. The Raman spectrum elucidated the characteristic peaks of the mixed topological insulator. The broadening of Raman peaks exhibited the formation of Te-Bi-Te and Te-Sb-Te bonds and associated vibrational modes. The single crystals are characterized by magneto-transport measurements down to 2 K and up to 14 Tesla transverse magnetic field. The residual resistance ratio (R200 K/R0 K) is found to be 3.64, which endorses the metallic nature of the synthesized crystal. The relative resistance turns out to be higher for the mixed TI than the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. The lower Debye temperature (82.64 K) of BiSbTe$_3$ connotes the presence of effective electron-phonon interaction at quite low temperatures in comparison to pure TI, which explains the observed suppression in magnetoresistance (MR) for the mixed TI. At 2 K, an MR of 150 percent is observed for BiSbTe$_3$, which is suppressed in contrast to the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. Though the MR% is suppressed significantly, its non-saturating linear behavior indicates the topological nature of the studied mixed TI. The modified Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) equation analysis of magneto-conductivity of mixed TI revealed that the conductivity has not only a surface states driven 2D component but also contributions from the bulk charge carriers and quantum scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ready Microwave Detection with Scalable Graphene Bolometers in the Strong Localization Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T&lt;100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>AC-Stark Spectroscopy of Interactions between Moir\'e Excitons and Polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable MoSe$_2$\WS$_2$ moir\'e heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moir\'e potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moir\'e potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moir\'e potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moir\'e heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Gauge Symmetry in (2+1)d Topological Orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

      <title>Minimal pole representation for spectral functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.</description>

      <title>$\Sigma$-Attention: A Transformer-based operator learning framework for self-energy in strongly correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\Sigma$-Attention, a Transformer-based operator-learning framework to address a key computational challenge in correlated materials. Our approach utilizes an Encoder-Only Transformer as an ansatz to approximate the self-energy operator of strongly correlated electronic systems. By creating a batched dataset that combines results from three complementary approaches: many-body perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansion, and exact diagonalization, each effective in specific parameter regimes, $\Sigma$-Attention is applied to learn a universal approximation for the self-energy operator that is valid across all regimes. This hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of existing methods while relying on the transformer's ability to generalize beyond individual limitations. More importantly, the scalability of the Transformer architecture allows the learned self-energy to be extended to systems with larger sizes, leading to much improved computational scaling. Using the 1D Hubbard model, we demonstrate that $\Sigma$-Attention can accurately predict the Matsubara Green's function and hence effectively captures the Mott transition at finite temperature. Our framework offers a promising and scalable pathway for studying strongly correlated systems with many possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations from the hexagonal spin clusters in the S = 1/2 distorted honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.</description>

      <title>Possible Unconventional Surface Superconductivity in the Half-Heusler YPtBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an extensive study of the noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler superconductor YPtBi, revealing an unusual relation between bulk superconductivity and the possible appearance of surface superconductivity on the (111) oriented surface, at temperatures up to 3 times the bulk transition temperature. Transport measurements confirmed the low carrier density of the material and its bulk superconducting transition, which was also observed in ac susceptibility through mutual inductance (MI) measurements. However, a weak signature of superconductivity in the MI measurements appeared much above the bulk transition temperature, which was further observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, pointing to a possible surface superconducting state. Polar Kerr effect measurements suggest that while the bulk superconductor may exhibit an unusual nodal superconducting state, only the surface state breaks time reversal symmetry. Complementary tunneling measurements on LuPtBi are used to establish the observations on YPtBi, while density-functional theory calculations may shed light on the origin of this unusual surface state.</description>
