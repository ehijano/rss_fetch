      <title>The effects of projection on measuring the splashback feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$ is a boundary of a halo that separates infalling and accreted matter. This results in a steep drop in the density profile at $R_{\rm st}$, which is a commonly adopted proxy for $R_{\rm sp}$. Observationally, $R_{\rm st}$ can be measured through fitting the projected galaxy number density profile of the halo, but there has been some discrepancy between the observed and expected $R_{\rm st}$. Therefore, we investigate whether the projection of the density profile onto the plane of the sky could lead to any systematic bias in determining $R_{\rm st}$, by studying the true 3-dimensional and projected halo density profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We investigate a range of projection lengths, and find that $R^p_{\rm st}$ obtained from projected profiles is close to the true $R^*_{\rm st}$, but has a slight decreasing trend with increasing projection length. We also quantify the prominence of the splashback feature and find how the feature shape changes with projection length.</description>

      <title>The HST-Hyperion Survey: Grism Observations of a $z\sim2.5$ Proto-Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first results and catalogs from the HST-Hyperion survey. This survey has collected 50 orbits of WFC3/F160W imaging and WFC3/G141 grism spectroscopy in the most overdense regions of the Hyperion proto-supercluster at $z\sim2.45$, which are analyzed in conjunction with the adjacent 56 orbits of WFC3/F140W imaging and WFC3/G141 grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey. Sources were identified and spectra extracted using GRIZLI, which subsequently fit the combined grism data with object-matched photometric data from the COSMOS2020 catalog to obtain a redshift and best-fit spectral model. Each source was then visually inspected by multiple team members and quality flags were assigned. A total of 12814 objects with $m_{HST} \leq 25.0$ were inspected, of which 5629 (44%) have reliable redshifts from the grism data, which are sensitive to emission lines at a level of $\sim8.8 \times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($1\sigma$). Comparison to high-quality ground-based spectroscopic redshifts yields a scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.0016$. The resulting catalogs contain 125 confirmed members of the Hyperion structure within $2.40&lt;z&lt;2.53$, with an additional 71 confirmed galaxies in projection within $2.35&lt;z&lt;2.65$. The redshift, stellar population, and line flux catalogs, as well as all grism spectra, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Molecular Hydrogen Cooling on the Galaxy Formation Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of molecular (${\rm H_2}$) and atomic (HI) hydrogen cooling on the galaxy formation threshold. We calculate the fraction of dark matter (DM) halos that exceed a critical mass required for star formation, $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, as a function of their peak mass. By convolving analytic halo mass accretion histories (MAHs) with models for $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, we predict that halos with peak virial masses below $\sim 10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ can form stars before reionization through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. These halos remain dark when only HI cooling and reionization are modeled. However, less than $\approx 10\%$ of halos with peak masses below $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ ever exceed $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, even when ${\rm H_2}$ cooling is included; this threshold is primarily set by relative streaming motion between DM and baryons imprinted at recombination. We obtain similar results using subhalo MAHs from an extremely high-resolution cosmological DM--only zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way (MW) analog (particle mass $6.3\times 10^3~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Based on the abundance of MW satellites, these results imply that at least some known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies formed through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. This work sharpens predictions for the galaxy formation threshold and demonstrates how its essential features emerge from the underlying distribution of halo growth histories.</description>

      <title>The Three-mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey. III. Data Release 6, An Atlas of Physical Conditions, Global Mass Conversion Laws, and 3D Physical Architecture of the Molecular ISM in the Fourth Quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Data Release 6 of ThrUMMS, consisting of complete data cubes and various moments of line emission ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) from molecular clouds, across 60$^{\circ}$$\times$2$^{\circ}$ of the Fourth Quadrant (4Q) of the Milky Way at a resolution of 72$''$ in (l,b) and 0.09 kms$^{-1}$ in V$_{LSR}$. From LTE radiative transfer analysis of the data cubes, we compute cubes and moments of the lines' opacity, excitation temperature, and column density $N_{12CO}$. Combining $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$ data, we derive a global mass conversion law $N$=$N_{0}I^{p}$, where $N_{0}$$\approx$10$^{18}$mol/m$^{2}$ and $p$=2 at this resolution. We argue that the standard linear $N$=$XI$ is only approximately valid: $p$$\sim$1.5-1.0 at coarser resolutions or in atypical locations, such as Galactic Center clouds. Also, the velocity dispersion distributions are very different between $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$, the former preferentially tracing more diffuse molecular gas. We re-evaluated Galactic rotation parameters for the 4Q, defining a new ``BGT'' model, and deprojected the (l,V) data onto (l,d) and (x,y) grids using standard kinematic procedures. To automate distance disambiguation inside the solar circle, we developed a simple $\zeta^{+}$ discriminator function and applied it to our deprojections. We discovered two previously unrecognised features of the molecular cloud population: widespread ripples in the midplane of wavelength 4kpc and amplitude 50pc, potentially generated by the last perigalactic passage of the Sgr dwarf; and three distant, massive molecular structures, the Far Ara clouds, two of which exhibit an exceptional velocity gradient, possibly arising in a massive spiral feather or a gas-rich dwarf galaxy $\sim$20--300kpc beyond the disk.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift ($3&lt;z&lt;13$) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of $10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; \mathrm{M}_{\ast} &lt; 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\approx6$, because the majority of galaxies at $z&gt;6$ show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H$\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H$\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\"{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.</description>

      <title>The Magnified Waltz: Simulating Light Curves of Binary Stars Passing through Micro-Caustics in Strong Lensing Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual stars located near the caustics of galaxy clusters can undergo extreme magnification when crossing micro-caustics, rendering them observable even at cosmological distances. Though most massive stars are likely reside in binary systems rather than as single star, the influence of binary star system on magnification events is severely under-explored. In this work, we simulate the light curves produced by detached binary stars crossing micro-caustics, aiming to characterize their unique observational signatures.Using high-resolution magnification maps generated by the GPU-PMO-CAUSTIC algorithm and PARSEC stellar models with red-shifted magnitude, we examined the impact of binary star parameters and crossing geometries on microlensing magnification patterns. Our simulations reveal that binary stars produce diverse light curve features, including overlapping peaks, plateau-like structures, and time-variable color-magnitude differences. These features, particularly the distinct temporal variations in spectral energy distributions, offer diagnostic tools for distinguishing binary systems from single stars.We further demonstrate the potential of multi-band photometry using the Chinese Space Station Telescope's Multi-Channel Imager (CSST-MCI) to capture these variations.Our findings provide theoretical support for identifying binary systems in future caustic-crossing events, enabling more accurate characterization of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat. VI. Analysis of the overall kinematics of Omega Centauri in 3D: velocity dispersion, kinematic distance, anisotropy, and energy equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster and is likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. In this paper, we analyze $\omega$ Cen's kinematics using data from oMEGACat, a comprehensive catalog of $\omega$ Cen's central regions, including 1.4 million proper motion measurements and 300,000 spectroscopic radial velocities. Our velocity dispersion profiles and kinematic maps are consistent with previous work but improve on their resolution, precision, and spatial coverage. The cluster's 3D dispersion is isotropic in the core, with increasing radial anisotropy at larger radii. The 2D kinematic maps show an elongation of the velocity dispersion field comparable to the flattening observed photometrically. We find good agreement between proper motions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion and measure a kinematic distance of 5494$\pm$61 pc, the most precise kinematic distance to $\omega$ Cen available. The subset of data with precise metallicity measurements shows no correlation between metallicity and kinematics, supporting the picture of well-mixed stellar populations within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. Finally, we study the degree of energy equipartition using a large range of stellar masses. We find partial energy equipartition in the center that decreases towards large radii. The spatial dependence of the radial energy equipartition is stronger than the tangential energy equipartition. Our kinematic observations can serve as a new reference for future dynamical modeling efforts that will help to further disentangle the complex mass distribution within $\omega$ Cen.</description>

      <title>Assessing differences between local galaxy dust attenuation and point source extinction within the same environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust attenuation in galaxies has often been used as a proxy for the extinction of point sources, such as supernovae, even though this approach ignores fundamental differences between the two cases. We present an analysis of the impact of geometric effects and scattering within dusty media on recovered galaxy dust properties. We use SKIRT, a radiative transfer code, to simulate observations of point sources embedded in dust clouds, as well as spiral and elliptical galaxies. We examine various galaxy morphologies, inclinations, and instrument apertures. We find that in galaxies the scattering of light into the line of sight and the presence of sources at different depths within the galaxy make attenuation fundamentally different from extinction. For a medium with intrinsic extinction slope Rv=3.068, we recover effective attenuation slopes Rv_e ranging from 0.5 to 7, showing that the two quantities are not analogous, even for local resolved observations. We find that Rv_e greatly depends on dust density, galaxy morphology, and inclination, the latter being the most significant. A single simulated galaxy, viewed from different angles, can reproduce the well-known relation between attenuation strength Av_e and Rv_e observed for star-forming galaxy samples. An increase in dust density leads to higher Rv_e across all inclinations, which, assuming a correlation between stellar mass and dust density, explains the increase in Rv_e with mass observed in star-forming galaxies. However, we are unable to explain the differences in Rv_e between star-forming and quiescent high-mass galaxies. We conclude that highly attenuated regions of simulated face-on galaxies yield Rv_e within 10% of the intrinsic extinction slope of the medium, allowing for the distinction of different dust types. For edge-on spirals, however, the median Rv_e for low Av_e regions appears to better approximate the extinction slope.</description>

      <title>The HST-Hyperion Survey: Companion Fraction and Overdensity in a z ~ 2.5 Proto-supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the galaxy merger and interaction activity within the Hyperion Proto-supercluster at z~2.5 in an effort to assess the occurrence of galaxy mergers and interactions in contrast to the coeval field and their impact on the build up of stellar mass in high density environments at higher-z. For this work, we utilize data from the Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE Survey (C3VO) along with extensive spectroscopic and photometric datasets available for the COSMOS field, including the HST-Hyperion Survey. To evaluate potential merger and interaction activity, we measure the fraction of galaxies with close kinematic companions ($f_{ckc}$) both within Hyperion and the coeval field by means of a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology developed in this work that probabilistically employs our entire combined spectroscopic and photometric dataset. We validate our $f_{ckc}$ MC methodology on a simulated lightcone built from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semi-analytic model, and we determine correction factors that account for the underlying spectroscopic sampling rate of our dataset. We find that galaxies in Hyperion have close kinematic companions $\gtrsim 2\times$ more than galaxies in the field and measure a corrected $f_{ckc}=49_{-7.8}^{+7.4}$% for Hyperion and a corrected $f_{ckc}=23_{-1.3}^{+1.2}$% for the surrounding field; a $&gt;3\sigma$ difference. This increase in $f_{ckc}$ indicates an enhancement in the merger and interaction activity within Hyperion and matches the trend seen in other structures. The rate of merger and interactions within the field implied from our field $f_{ckc}$ measurement is well aligned with values measured from other observations in similar redshift ranges. The enhanced $f_{ckc}$ measured within Hyperion suggests that merger and interaction activity play an important role in the mass growth of galaxies in denser environments at higher z.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 down to M_*= 10^4 M_Sun. A local perspective using the metallicity distribution of RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is a fundamental scale law of galaxies. It is observed to evolve with redshift in unresolved galaxies up to z&gt;6. However, observational constraints limits our view at such early epochs to galaxies with M_* &gt;= 10^7 M_Sun. On the other hand, in the local Universe the MZR can be traced down to the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function (M_*= 10^2 M_Sun) but we have access only to its present-day realization. We propose to use RR Lyrae stars to get the mean metallicity of local dwarf galaxies at the early epoch in which these variable stars were formed (z&gt;~3), opening a new window on the evolution of the MZR across cosmic times down to the lowest mass. We use available data for a sample of Milky Way satellites to show that indeed the evolution of the MZR from the epoch of the formation of RR Lyrae to the present day can be traced with this approach, with results broadly compatible with those inferred from high z galaxies from nebular emission lines.</description>

      <title>Extended atomic carbon around molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models predict that atomic carbon occurs at the surface and in the process of the formation of molecular clouds, making its fine structure transitions a diagnostic of cloud formation. We study the distribution of atomic carbon in a small inconspicuous region towards the outer Galaxy that might be representative for a large fraction of the molecular gas of the Milky Way that is not directly affected by star formation. We observed a small strip of 5 arcminutes in the ``Forgotten Quadrant'', the third quadrant of the Milky Way, with the APEX telescope in the $^3P_1-^3P_0$ [CI] transition of atomic carbon and the $J=2-1$ transition of the three most abundant CO isotopologues and compared their distribution with existing measurements of gas column density and of ionized carbon. The atomic carbon shows a very smooth distribution with the smallest gradient along the strip compared to the other lines. It is always brighter than $^{13}$CO and in one velocity-component even brighter than CO. In contrast to observations of many star-forming regions, the [CI] emission seems to extend beyond the molecular gas, in line with the models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs). However, a standard PDR model fit to the observations fails because the models either predict more molecular gas, traced through C$^{18}$O, or more diffuse gas, traced through [CII], than observed. The carbon-budget in the gas phase does not add up to the same column seen through dust emission. To understand the [CI] emission from galaxies it is necessary to get the full statistics for the quiescent gas outside of the star-forming regions that behaves significantly different from dense gas exposed to high ultraviolet fields.</description>

      <title>Probing circular polarization and magnetic field structure in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field morphology of relativistic jets can be studied with circular polarization (CP). Recent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations make strong predictions about the level (and morphology) of the jet's CP emission. These simulations show that the sign of CP and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) are both sensitive to the jet's magnetic field morphology within the radio core. We probe this theory by exploring if the jet's radio core EVPA orientation is consistent with the observed sign of the core CP in deep full-track polarimetric observations. We aim to probe the nature of linear polarization and CP in the innermost regions of jets from a small sample of nine blazars. This sample includes sources that have exhibited: (i) positive CP, (ii) negative CP, or (iii) positive &amp; negative CP simultaneously in the radio core region. Nine blazar sources were observed using the VLBA at both 15 GHz and 23 GHz. Our self-calibration relies on a physically based model applied in DoG-HiT resulting in more accurate gains. We consider compact Stokes V structures instead of assuming it to be zero, which is crucial given the significant non-zero CP fraction observed at long baselines. We observe robust, relatively high degrees of fractional circular polarization m_c=(0.32 +- 0.2)% at 15 GHz and m_c=(0.59 +-0.56)% at 23 GHz. We observe consistent polarized structure and EVPA orientation over time when comparing our analysis with archival MOJAVE data. Theoretical predictions indicate a clear favored toroidal magnetic field orientation within the extended jet emission of the reconstructed signal of the blazar 0149+218. The jet structures of 1127-145 and 0528+134, even in superresolution, exhibit characteristics aligned with helical or poloidal magnetic nature.</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). V. Deuterium Fractionation of Methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $5_1-4_1$ A$^+$, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $14_1-13_2$ A$^-$, and CH$_2$DOH $8_{2,6}-8_{1,7}$ $e_0$ lines toward 24 high-mass star-forming regions by using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with an angular resolution of about 0$^{\prime\prime}$.3. This resolution corresponds to a linear scale of 400-1600 au, allowing us to resolve individual cores properly. We detected the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH emission near the continuum peaks in many of these regions. From the two $^{13}$CH$_3$OH lines, we calculated the temperature toward the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH peaks, and confirm that the emission traces hot ($&gt;$100 K) regions. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in the observed high-mass star-forming regions is found to be lower than that in low-mass star-forming regions. We have found no correlation between the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{13}$CH$_3$OH) or $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratios and either temperatures or distance to the sources, and have also found a source-to-source variation in these ratios. Our model calculations predict that the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in hot cores depends on the duration of the cold phase; the shorter the cold phase, the lower the deuterium fractionation in the hot cores. We have suggested that the lower $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions compared to that in low-mass star-forming regions is due to the shorter duration of the cold phase and that the diversity in the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions is due to the diversity in the length of the cold prestellar phase, and not the time that the objects have been in the hot core phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out an imaging survey of six globular clusters (GCs) with a limit magnitude to 22 mag at the 5 sigma level, down to the main sequence stars of the respective cluster, as one of the pilot observing program of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). This paper present the early results of this survey, where we investigate the tidal characters at the periphery of the clusters NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5053, NGC 5272, NGC 5904 and NGC 6341. We present the estimated number density of cluster candidates and their spatial distribution. We confirm the presence of tidal arms in NGC 4147 and NGC 5904 and identify several intriguing potential tidal structures in NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5272, corroborated the elliptical morphology of the periphery of NGC 6341. Our findings underscore the WFST's capability for probing faint structural features in GCs, paving the way for future in-depth studies, especially for the search of the large scale tidal streams associated with the clusters with the future wide field survey.</description>

      <title>Formation of the dark-matter deficient S0 galaxy NGC 4111 under the tidal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the high-sensitivity and large-scale atomic hydrogen (HI) observations towards lenticular (S0) galaxy NGC 4111 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). The column density map shows that NGC4111 and seven other different types of galaxies share a huge HI gas complex. The data also suggest that NGC 4111 is interacting with seven galaxies. Moreover, we identified a rotating gas disk associated with NGC 4111 from the HI complex. Still, the HI disk rotation direction has deviated from its stellar disk about 34.2$^{\circ}$, indicating that the NGC 4111 galaxy is undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0 galaxy by the tidal interactions. The obtained dark matter-to-stellar mass ratio of NGC4111 is 3.1$\pm$0.7, which is lower than the average value of the Local Universe, implying that the interactions may strip its dark matter. Our results suggest that in a galaxy group environment, tidal interactions have a significant effect on galaxy features.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: Unveiling the Magnetic Fields around Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We acquired 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s{^{-1}} cloud (20MC), 50 km s{^{-1}} cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are {\sim}1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and {\sim}2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma {\beta}, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfv\'en Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Is there an analogue of the Radcliffe wave between the Carina-Sagittarius and Scutum arms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most complete sample of galactic maser sources and radio stars with trigonometric parallaxes, proper motions and radial velocities measured by the VLBI method has been compiled based on literature data. These sources are associated with young stars located in high mass star forming regions. The rotation parameters of the Galaxy have been determined based on 156 masers with relative parallax errors less than 10\%, located further than 3 kpc from the galactic center. The linear rotation velocity of the Galaxy at the solar distance $R_0$ is $V_0=243.9\pm3.9$ km s$^{-1}$. A very narrow chain of masers 3-4 kpc long, elongated in the $\sim40^\circ$ direction, passing from a segment of the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm to the Scutum arm, has been studied. A number of authors have hypothesized that this is a possible analogue of the Radcliffe wave. In the present work, no noticeable periodic perturbations of vertical coordinates and velocities were found in this structure. On the other hand, on the diagram ``$\ln(R/R_0)-\theta$'' this chain of masers has the form of a segment of a logarithmic spiral with a pitch angle of $-48^\circ$. Perhaps this chain of masers belongs to a jet extending from the end of the bar, rotating rigidly with the angular velocity of the bar.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey V. H i kinematics and Fornax cluster membership of the dwarf galaxy ESO 358-60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MeerKAT Fornax Survey (MFS) is a large survey project mapping the HI in the Fornax cluster. Most of the cluster members detected in HI show significant signs of interaction with the intra-cluster medium or other galaxies. The galaxy ESO 358-60 however stands out as its large HI disk appears regular and undisturbed. A possible explanation for this undisturbed disk is that the galaxy is not in Fornax.
  We analyze the HI distribution within and around ESO 358-60 based on the MFS observations. We visually inspect the low resolution data in order to study the HI disk from the center to its outskirts and look for low column density gas that could reveal recent interactions. We then construct a detailed parameterization of the HI disk by fitting a tilted ring model to the high resolution data cube. We use the fitted rotational velocity to place the galaxy on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship. By equating the galaxy's HI and 3.6 $\mu$m fluxes to the thus retrieved baryonic mass, we obtain a redshift independent distance.
  Our modeling confirms the regularity of the HI disk in ESO 358-60 but also shows that the galaxy contains a significant line of sight warp and contains radial motions, of the order of 10 km s$^{-1}$, that cover the extent of the optical disk. From the modeling we obtain a velocity V$_{\rm flat} = $48.1 $\pm$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$ for the best fit rotation curve. This leads to a distance from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of 9.4 $\pm$ 2.5 Mpc,$\sim$ 10 Mpc less than the distance to the Fornax cluster. This distance not only fits better with V$_{\rm flat}$ but also with the overall HI distribution of low mass galaxies and the fact that the galaxy appears undisturbed and reasonably symmetric. At 9.4 Mpc ESO 358-60 cannot be a member of the Fornax cluster but is a foreground field galaxy.</description>

      <title>FR I Radio Galaxy 3C 348 Accumulation Patterns and Dust Ring Occlusion Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies can be classified into two types, FR I and FR II, depending on their morphology. So far, the reasons for the different behaviour of FR I and FR II in observations have not been clarified. While the Unified Model suggests that the viewing angle and the obscuring effect of the dust ring are the main reasons for the difference in the classification of FR I and FR II radio galaxies, it has been found that the accretion rate and the accretion pattern of the central engine may play a more crucial role. In order to investigate the physical properties of these sources, the cloudy program was used to simulate the 3C 348 radio source outlook ionisation model, and it was found that its optical emission in the nuclear region is significantly lower than the theoretical prediction, which suggests the existence of an obscuration effect, which was later further proved by the spectral decomposition method. And using the thermometric photometry-jet relationship, it is found that the accretion rate in its nuclear region is much lower than the accretion rate inverted from the total jet power, indicating that its accretion mode is in the critical stage of the transition from the standard thin disc to the ADAF. Combined with its Bondi accretion rate, the fitted energy spectrum of the nuclear region shows that the evolution of its jet power is controlled by the change of the central accretion engine.</description>

      <title>Resonant Drag Instabilities for Polydisperse Dust, I. The Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur whenever there exists a relative velocity between gas and dust. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, for which a strong interaction can be found between drifting dust and a travelling gas wave, leading to fast-growing perturbations (growth rates $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$) even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$. They are called resonant drag instabilities. We focus on the acoustic resonant drag instability, which is potentially important in AGB star outflows, around supernova remnants and star clusters in starburst galaxies. We study the acoustic resonant drag instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether it survives in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid for the acoustic drag instability, focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the fast-growing perturbations $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ of the monodisperse limit into slower growing perturbations $\propto \mu$ due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. Furthermore, the large wave numbers that grow fastest in the monodisperse regime are stabilized by a size distribution, severely limiting the growth rates in the polydisperse regime. The acoustic resonant drag instability turns from a singularly perturbed problem in $\mu$ in the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation for a sufficiently wide size distribution. It can still grow exponentially in the polydisperse regime, but at a slower pace compared to the single size case.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES XXXIV: Magnetic Field Structure in Edge-On Galaxies Characterising large-scale magnetic fields in galactic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding galactic magnetic fields is essential for interpreting feedback processes in galaxies. Despite their importance, the exact structure of these fields, particularly in galactic halos, remains unclear. Accurate descriptions are crucial for understanding the interaction between star formation and halo magnetisation. By systematically analysing the polarisation patterns in halos of nearby galaxies, we aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between galactic magnetic fields and star formation processes. We provide an analytical description of the observed X-shaped halos. Based on radio polarimetry data, we classify the polarisation patterns of a sample of edge-on galaxies, by using a newly introduced three-class system: disc dominated, small-scale, and X-shaped. We then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified as X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other physical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11 out of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies classified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected for their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized HI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best fitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the X-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the interplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the galactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals that most exhibit an X-shaped configuration, indicating a common magnetic field structure in galactic halos. The introduced models capture the X-shaped morphology and reveal the link between the X-shape's opening angle and star formation rate surface density.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Alignment of Galaxy Group Angular Momentum with Cosmic Filament Spines: An Observational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment between the angular momenta of galaxy groups and the spines of their associated cosmic filaments. Our results demonstrate a significant tendency for these two orientations to be perpendicular, indicating that the rotation of a galaxy group does not originate from the spin of cosmic filaments. Instead, it is driven by the orbital angular momentum contributed by member galaxies as they accrete along the direction of the filament spines. Moreover, the strength of this perpendicular alignment signal varies with the richness of the galaxy groups, with the most pronounced alignment observed among the wealthiest groups. This pronounced alignment is largely due to the more coherent spatial distribution of member galaxies in richer groups relative to the filament spines. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of angular momentum acquisition in galaxy groups from an observational standpoint.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as the Very First Activity of Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$ within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts $z \sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z &lt; 4$. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5$, which follows $\propto (1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.</description>

Abstract: Fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular parsec-scale clumps into cores of ~1000 au are still open, that only a statistically significant investigation with ALMA is able to address: what are the dominant agents that determine the core demographics, mass, and spatial distribution as a function of the physical properties of the hosting clumps, their evolutionary stage and the different Galactic environments in which they reside? To what extent extent is fragmentation driven by clumps dynamics or mass transport in filaments? With ALMAGAL we observed the 1.38 mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps in our Galaxy, with M&gt;500M_sun, surface density &gt; 0.1 g/cm2 and d&lt;7.5 kpc. The ACA and two 12-m array setups were used to deliver a minimum resolution of ~1000 au over the entire sample distance range. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to HII regions from the tip of the Galactic bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The spectral setup includes several molecular lines to trace the multiscale physics and dynamics of gas, notably CH3CN, H2CO, SiO, CH3OH, DCN, HC3N, SO etc. We present an initial overview of the observations and the early science product and results, with a first characterization of the morphological properties of the continuum emission. We use "perimeter-versus-area" and convex hull-versus-area metrics to classify the different morphologies. More extended and morphologically complex shapes are found toward clumps that are relatively more evolved and have higher surface densities.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL II. The ALMA evolutionary study of high-mass protocluster formation in the Galaxy. ALMA data processing and pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.</description>

      <title>The shape of FIREbox galaxies and a potential tension with low-mass disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intrinsic and observable shapes of approximately 700 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $10^8 - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ from the FIREbox simulation at $z=0$. We calculate intrinsic axis ratios using inertia tensors weighted by: All Stars, Young Stars, and Luminosity-weighted Stars. Young Stars, in particular, are arranged in systematically different 3D configurations as a function of galaxy stellar mass, with spheroidal, elongated, and disky shapes dominant at stellar masses of $10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$, $10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$, and $10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We construct mock images for each galaxy and show that projected short-to-long axis ratios, $q$, inferred from 2D S\'ersic fits are most closely related to Luminosity-weighted tensor shapes and least resemble the All Stars shapes. This suggests observed 2D shape distributions should not be compared to predictions based on 3D stellar mass shapes. We construct a sample of mock images projected in random orientations and compare them to observed axis ratio distributions from the GAMA survey. For galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10} - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, we reproduce axis ratios comparable to the thinnest observed in real galaxies ($q \sim 0.1$), suggesting this model is capable of making thin disk galaxies at Milky Way scale. However, at masses below $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we produce an insufficient population of galaxies with observed $q&lt;0.4$ and none with $q&lt;0.2$, suggesting that FIREbox does not produce enough low-mass disk galaxies. Future observational and theoretical programs aimed at understanding low-mass disk fractions will provide crucial tests of galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL III. Compact source catalog: Fragmentation statistics and physical evolution of the core population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms behind the fragmentation of high-mass dense clumps into compact star-forming cores are fundamental topics in current astrophysical research. The ALMAGAL survey provides the opportunity to study this process at an unprecedented level of detail and statistical significance, featuring high-angular resolution $1.38$ mm ALMA observations of $1013$ massive dense clumps at various Galactic locations. These clumps cover a wide range of distances, masses, surface densities, and evolutionary stages. Here, we present the catalog of compact sources obtained with the CuTEx algorithm from continuum images of the full ALMAGAL clump sample combining ACA-$7$m and $12$m ALMA arrays, reaching a uniform high median spatial resolution of $\sim1400$ au. We discuss the fragmentation properties and the estimated physical parameters of the core population. The ALMAGAL compact source catalog includes $6348$ cores detected in $844$ clumps ($83\%$ of the total), with a number of cores per clump between $1$ and $49$ (median of $5$). The estimated core diameters are mostly within $\sim800-3000$ au (median of $1700$ au). We obtained core masses from $0.002$ to $345\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We evaluated the variation in the core mass function (CMF) with evolution as traced by the clump $L/M$, finding a clear, robust shift and change in slope among CMFs within subsamples at different stages. This finding suggests that the CMF shape is not constant throughout the star formation process, but rather it builds (and flattens) with evolution, with higher core masses reached at later stages. We found that all cores within a clump grow in mass on average with evolution, and the number of cores increases with the core masses. Our results favor a clump-fed scenario for high-mass star formation, in which cores form as low-mass seeds, and then gain mass while further fragmentation occurs in the clump.</description>

      <title>Measuring photo-ionization rate and mean free path of HeII ionizing photons at $2.5 \leq z \leq 3.6$: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization Part-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements of the spatially averaged HeII photo-ionization rate ($\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$), mean free path of HeII ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$), and HeII fraction ($f_{\rm HeII}$) across seven redshift bins within the redshift range $2&lt;z&lt;4$. The measurements are obtained by comparing the observed effective optical depth distribution of HeII ($\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$) with models generated by post-processing of the Sherwood simulation suite using our code EXCITE. With EXCITE, we efficiently explore a large parameter space ($\sim 15000$ models) by varying $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. We employ Anderson-Darling test for the cumulative distribution of $\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$ to simultaneously measure $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. Our measurements account for possible observational and modeling uncertainties stemming mainly from the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data and thermal parameter uncertainties. We find significant evolution, with the best-fit $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$ and $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ decreasing by factors of $\sim 4.32$ and $ \sim 3.27$, respectively, from $z = 2.88$ to $z = 3.16$. Based on these measurements, we constrain the emissivity at the HeII ionization frequency ($\epsilon_{228}$) and HeII ionizing photon emission rate ($\dot{n}$), finding consistency with results from galaxy and QSO surveys. Comparison of our measured parameters with widely used uniform UVB models supports a scenario where HeII reionization is not completed before $z\sim2.74$. Our measured evolution is complementary and in good agreement with recent measurements of thermal parameters of the IGM, suggesting a coherent picture of rather late and rapid HeII reionization.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a pair of very metal-poor stars enriched in neutron-capture elements: The proto-disk r-II star BPS CS 29529-0089 and the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus r-I star TYC 9219-2422-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: R-process enhanced metal-poor stars (\EuFe$\geq+0.3$ and \FeH$\leq-1.0$) are rare objects whose study can provide clues to the astrophysical sites of the rapid neutron capture process. In this study, we investigate the detailed chemical abundance patterns of two of these anomalous stars, originally identified among stars observed by the GALAH survey. Our aim is to obtain the detailed chemical abundance pattern of these stars with spectroscopy at higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We use a calibration of the infrared flux method to determine accurate effective temperatures, and \Gaia~ parallaxes together with broadband photometry and theoretical bolometric corrections to determine surface gravity. Metallicities and chemical abundances are determined with model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis. We also integrate stellar orbits for a complete chemodynamic analysis. e determine abundances for up to 47 chemical species (44 elements), of which 27 are neutron-capture elements. Corrections because of deviations from the local thermodynamical equilibrium are applied to the metallicities and 12 elements. We find that one of the stars, BPS CS 29529-0089, is a proto-disk star of the Milky Way of r-II type, with \EuFe=+1.79~dex. The second star, TYC 9219-2422-1, is part of the halo and associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. It is of r-I type with [Eu/Fe] = +0.54. Abundances of Th are also provided for both stars. BPS CS 29529-0089 is the most extreme example of r-process enhanced star known with disk-like kinematics and that is not carbon enhanced. TYC 9219-2422-1 is found to be an archetypal Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star. Their abundances of C, Mg, Ni, Sc, Mn, and Al seem consistent with expectations for stars enriched by a single population III core collapse supernova, despite their relatively high metallicities ([Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$2.4).</description>

      <title>Modeling Asteroseismic Yields for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred: Gas Properties Outside of Galaxy Cluster with the WHIM Contribution and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and detectability of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) gas with temperatures in the range $10^5&lt;T&lt;10^7$K around galaxy clusters using simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project. In simulations with different input physics (GIZMO-SIMBA and Gadget-X), we consistently find that the median gas temperature decreases to the WHIM upper bound, $10^7$K, at $\sim 2 \times R_{200c}$, while the WHIM mass fraction increases with radius until $\sim 3\times R_{200c}$, where it plateaus at $\sim 70$ per cent.By simulating X-ray emission from all gas components, we find that the WHIM contribution to the soft X-ray band (0.2 - 2.3 keV) increases with radius but eventually plateaus at larger distances. The differences between the two simulations become more pronounced at higher redshifts and larger radii. Finally, after accounting for observational effects, primarily by removing (sub)halos, we predict that the signal-to-noise ratio of the X-ray signal obtained by stacking the eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue will be $\sim 7$ for GIZMO-SIMBA and $\sim 21$ for Gadget-X.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar infrared emission bands (AIBs). However, current spectral databases for AIB analysis face limitations because of the neglect of anharmonicity in vibrations and of temperature effects, which result from the high computational cost of traditional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic infrared (IR) spectra while accounting for temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We apply MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1\,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its ability to handle large molecular systems. Our results suggest that MLMD can facilitate the creation of extensive molecular spectral databases, advancing AI-assisted analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly with upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>First VLBI Imaging of SiO $v=0$, $J=1 \rightarrow 0$ Masers in VY Canis Majoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We achieved the first VLBI detections of the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) $^{28}$SiO (hereafter, SiO) and $^{29}$SiO masers of the $J=1\rightarrow 0$ rotational transitions, towards the 25 \Msun ~red supergiant (RSG) star, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa), taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes that coordinate with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. In addition, we successfully detected the SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ transition in the $v=3$ state towards VY CMa for the first time with VLBI. The SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ maser spot in $v=0$ state was detected in the cross-power spectra taken with the baselines involving the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The combination of previously reported absolute astrometry and the relative astrometry technique allowed us to derive the location of the SiO $v=0$ maser spot, {(RA, DEC) = ( 7${\rm ^h}$ 22${\rm ^m}$ 58.$^{\rm s}$32, $-$25$^{\circ}$ 46$^{\prime}$ 3.$^{\prime\prime}$4) in J2000 at an absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$100 milliarcseconds (mas). The SiO $v=0$ maser spot is offset by the amount of ($\Delta$RA, $\Delta$DEC)=($-$150, $-$300) (mas) to the southwest of the stellar position, suggesting that the $v = 0$ maser spot is associated with its outflow activity.} This observational study demonstrates that the brightest SiO $v=0$ maser spot is compact (3 mas), producing an extremely high brightness of $\sim$ 10$^7$ K. This indicates that the SiO $v=0$ maser action may originate from strong shocks in the stellar wind emanating from this extreme RSG that leads to its intense mass ejection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a brief introduction to the chemical composition of the Sun. The focus of the chapter is on results obtained from the physical analysis of the solar photosphere. Data obtained from meteorites, solar wind and corona measurements, as well as helioseismology, and solar neutrinos are briefly reviewed. The elemental and isotopic composition of the solar system is derived by combining the solar and meteoritic data. The cosmochemical and astronomical abundance scales are described. The results of the determinations of the protosolar chemical composition, as well as the initial and present-day mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals (X, Y, Z) for the solar system are presented in extensive tables. All tables are also available in machine-readable form via Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14988840</description>

      <title>On the relation between magnetic field strength and gas density in the interstellar medium: A multiscale analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic field strength to gas density relation in the interstellar medium is of fundamental importance. We present and compare Bayesian analyses of the B-n relation for two comprehensive observational data sets: a Zeeman data set and 700 observations using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method. Using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis we present a general, multi-scale broken power-law relation, $B=B_0(n/n_0)^{\alpha}$ , with $\alpha=\alpha_1$ for $n&lt;n_0$ and $\alpha_2$ for $n&gt;n_0$, and with $B_0$ the field strength at $n_0$. For the Zeeman data we find: $\alpha_1={0.15^{+0.06}_{-0.09}}$ for diffuse gas and $\alpha_2 = {0.53^{+0.09}_{-0.07}}$ for dense gas with $n_0 = 4.00^{+12.7}_{-2.90} \times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. For the DCF data we find: $\alpha_1={0.26^{+0.15}_{-0.15}}$ and $\alpha_2={0.77_{-0.15}^{+0.14}}$, with $n_0=13.9^{+10.1}_{-7.30} \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, where the uncertainties give 68\% credible intervals. We perform a similar analysis on nineteen numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations covering a wide range of physical conditions from protostellar disks to dwarf and Milky Way-like galaxies, completed with the AREPO, Flash, Pencil, and Ramses codes. The resulting exponents depend on several physical factors such as dynamo effects and their time scales, turbulence, and initial seed field strength. \textcolor{red}{We find that the dwarf and Milky Way-like galaxy simulations produce results closest to the observations.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: A history of galaxy migrations over the Stellar Mass - SFR plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar mass-star formation rate (M$_\star$ - SFR) plane is essential for distinguishing galaxy populations, but how galaxies move within this plane over cosmic time remains unclear. This study aims to describe galaxy migrations in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane by reconstructing star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of galaxies out to redshift $z &lt; 4$. This provides insights into the physical processes driving star formation. We use data from the COSMOS field, selecting 299131 galaxies at $z &lt; 4$ with COSMOS-Web NIRCam data (m$_\mathrm{F444W} &lt; 27$) over 0.54 deg$^2$. Using the SED modeling code CIGALE with non-parametric SFHs, we derive physical properties and migration vectors for these galaxies. These vectors describe the direction and velocity of evolutionary paths across the M$_\star$ - SFR plane. To assess the accuracy of these vectors, we compare them to results from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Galaxies within the main sequence show low migration amplitudes and dispersed movement directions, indicating oscillation within the main sequence. Most progenitors were already on the main sequence a billion years earlier. Starburst galaxies assembled half their mass in the last 350 Myr and originated from the main sequence. Passive galaxies show uniformly declining SFHs and include massive galaxies already in the passive region at $z = 3.5-4$, with increasing density over time. Using reconstructed SFHs up to $z &lt; 4$, we propose a coherent picture of how galaxies migrate over cosmic time in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane, highlighting the connection between major phases in the star-formation history.</description>

      <title>Halo Spin Dependence on Environment for HI-bearing galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the semi-analytic method, we compute halo spins for a substantial sample of HI-bearing galaxies observed in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey. Our statistical analysis reveals a correlation between halo spin and environment, although the trend is subtle. On average, galaxies exhibit a decreasing halo spin tendency in denser environments. This observation contrasts with previous results from $N$-body simulations in the Lambda cold dark matter framework. The discrepancy may be attributed to environmental gas stripping, leading to an underestimation of halo spins in galaxies in denser environments, or to baryonic processes that significantly alter the original dark matter halo spins, deviating from previous $N$-body simulation findings.</description>

      <title>Alignment of Blue/Green and Red Early-type Galaxies with Large-scale Filaments Reveals Distinct Evolutionary Pathways</title>

Abstract: We investigate the alignment of non-red early-type galaxies (ETGs) with blue or green colors within large-scale filaments and compare this alignment pattern with that of red ETGs. Our analysis reveals a significant alignment of the major axes of red ETGs with the orientations of their host cosmic filaments, consistent with prior research. In contrast, non-red ETGs show no significant alignment signal. This divergence in alignment behavior between non-red and red ETGs plausibly suggests distinct evolutionary pathways for non-red and red ETGs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the globular clusters of NGC1052-DF2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 has captured the interest of astronomers ever since the low velocity dispersion measured from ten globular clusters (GCs) suggested a low dark matter fraction. Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a peak of the GC luminosity function at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work, we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of eleven individual GCs, finding them to be old ($&gt; 9$ Gyr) with a range of metallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc; Beasley et al. 2025), we derived photometric GC masses and found that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and found $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$, when the one GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered as an interloper. We discuss the possible origin of NGC1502-DF2 considering the lower distance, spread of GC metallicities, flat stellar population profiles, and dynamical mass estimate.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters: The Hidden Role of Low-Luminosity Galaxies in Coma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Coma cluster, one of the richest and most well-known systems at low redshifts, to explore the importance of low-flux objects in the identification of cluster substructures. In addition, we conduct a study of the infall flow around Coma, considering the presence or absence of low-flux objects across the projected phase space of the cluster. Our results indicate that low-luminosity galaxies play a fundamental role in understanding the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. These galaxies, often overlooked because of their faint nature, serve as sensitive tracers of substructure dynamics and provide crucial insights into the cluster's evolutionary history. We show that not considering the low-flux objects present in clusters can lead to significant underestimates of the numbers of substructures, both in most central parts, in the infall regions, and beyond, connecting to the large-scale structure up to a distance of approximately $8 R_{200}$ from the center of Coma.</description>

      <title>The $M_{*}-M_{\rm BH}$ Relation Evolution from z $\sim$ 6 to the Present Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, $M_{*}$, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), $M_\bullet$, the ``Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z $\ge$ 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ for z $\ge$ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;10$). However, similarly high values of $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ are also found in low mass galaxies at $z \sim$ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z $\sim$ 6 quasars can have $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ values.</description>

      <title>Very Local Impact on the Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei below 100 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of primary and secondary CR spectra, their arrival directions, and our improved knowledge of the magnetic field geometry around the heliosphere allow us to set a bound on the distance beyond which a puzzling 10-TeV ``bump'' and certain related spectral features \emph{cannot} originate. The sharpness of the spectral breaks associated with the bump, the abrupt change of the CR intensity across the local magnetic equator ($90^{\circ}$ pitch angle), and the similarity between the primary and secondary CR spectral patterns point to a local reacceleration of the bump particles out of the background CRs. We argue that, owing to a steep preexisting CR spectrum, a nearby shock may generate such a bump by boosting particle rigidity by a mere factor of $\sim$1.5 in the range below 50 TV. Reaccelerated particles below $\sim$0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar medium flow and do not reach the Sun. The particles above this rigidity then form the bump. This single universal process is responsible for the observed spectral features of all CR nuclei, primary and secondary, in the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable candidate is the system of shocks associated with $\epsilon$ Eridani star at 3.2 pc of the Sun, which is well aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field. Other shocks, such as old supernova shells, may produce a similar effect. We provide a simple formula that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only three parameters uniquely derived from the CR proton data. We show how our formalism predicts helium, boron, carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra. Our model thus unifies all the CR spectral features observed below 50 TV.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 we derive new distances and luminosities for a sample of Galactic B supergiants which were thought to be post main-sequence (MS) objects from their HR diagram location beyond the terminal-age MS (TAMS). When applying the newer Gaia distances in addition to enhanced amounts of core-boundary mixing, aka convective overshooting, we show that these Galactic B supergiants are likely enclosed within the MS band, indicating an evolutionary stage of steady core hydrogen burning. We discuss the importance of considering enhanced overshooting and how vectors in the mass-luminosity plane (ML-plane) can be used to disentangle the effects of wind mass loss from interior mixing. We finish with the key message that any proposed solution to the BSG problem should consider not only an explanation for the sheer number of B supergiants inside the Hertzsprung gap, but should at the same time also account for the steep drop in rotation rates identified at spectral type B1 -- corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim$21 kK, and for which two distinct families of solutions have been proposed.</description>

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>
