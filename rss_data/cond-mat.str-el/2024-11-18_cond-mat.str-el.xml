      <title>An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations arising from anisotropic Dirac spinons in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{0.33}$(OD)$_{0.67}$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. These results provide further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</description>

      <title>Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4$f$ electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient $\gamma_{n}(0)$. The calculated Wilson ratio $R_\mathrm{W}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}}$ is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4$f$ and Ru-4$d$ electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.</description>

      <title>Impact of triplon damping on thermal Hall conductivity in Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall effect in the Shastry-Sutherland model, incorporating interactions between quasiparticle excitations. In this model, with strong nearest-neighbor interactions, the ground state is well described by the direct product of spin-singlet states, and the elementary excitations to spin-triplet states are known as triplons. In candidate materials for this model, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are inevitably present, resulting in topologically non-trivial band structures for triplon excitations. In this study, we examine quasiparticle damping due to triplon-triplon interactions as a potential factor contributing to the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We apply nonlinear flavor-wave theory to the Shastry-Sutherland model and treat triplons as bosonic excitations. We calculate the triplon damping rate using the imaginary Dyson equation approach and evaluate the thermal Hall conductivity. Our findings demonstrate that triplons with nonzero Berry curvature are scattered by thermally excited triplons. This scattering effect suppresses the thermal Hall conductivity, particularly at finite temperatures, highlighting the significant role of triplon damping in the thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic fragmented ground state in the pyrochlore Ho$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consecutive magnetic ordering of the Ho and Ru ions in the pyrochlore Ho2Ru2O7 and their interplay are investigated by neutron scattering, magnetic and specific heat measurements. The Ru magnetic moments order at 95 K into an easy-plane antiferromagnetic state, while the Ho moments order at 1.55 K into an unsaturated ferromagnetic state that retains an extensive ground state entropy and present complex spin dynamics throughout the low temperature phase. These unexpected features are analyzed in terms of a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to the pyrochlore kagome ice. Selection of this unusual state relies on a subtle compromise between long-range ferromagnetic interactions between holmium moments and a repulsive cubic field, both mediated by the ruthenium lattice.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $6 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical control of charge orders in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ with $A=$ K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the $p$-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hall effect has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms, where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we suggest a possible explanation of the giant temperature peak in the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations observed at very low temperatures in insulating SmB$_6$ system. Our theoretical model consists of two fermions with particle-like dispersion but with different masses, one much heavier than the other, which hybridize with each other to open up a gap at their degeneracy point. As a result of the hybridization a heavy-fermion hybrid appears at the Fermi level. Our results strongly suggest that it is exactly this heavy-fermion hybrid which results in the giant temperature peak. In addition we propose a scenario when this hybrid has edge states.</description>

Abstract: ComDMFT is a parallel computational package designed to study the electronic structure of correlated quantum materials from first principles. Our approach is based on the combination of first-principles methods and dynamical mean field theories. In version 2.0, we implemented fully-diagrammatic GW+EDMFT from first-principles. In this approach, correlated electrons are treated within full GW+EDMFT and the rest are treated within full-GW, seamlessly. This implementation enables the electronic structure calculation of quantum materials with weak, intermediate, and strong electron correlation without prior knowledge of the degree of electron correlation.</description>

      <title>HEOM-QUICK2: a general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body open quantum systems -- An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations, non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2 has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions. Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena and exploring applications in various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Quantum weight: A fundamental property of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a ground state property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelengths. The quantum weight contains a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system, and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or Coulomb systems in low dimensions, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary condition) can be determined directly from the quantum weight that is a part of an equal-time ground-state correlation function. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on their quantum weight in terms of electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron loss spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Strange metal and superconductor in the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic evidence for polaron stabilization inside the antiferromagnetic order of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials exhibiting electronic inhomogeneities at the nanometer scale have enormous potential for applications. Magnetic polarons are one such type of inhomogeneity which link the electronic, magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in correlated matter and often give rise to colossal magnetoresistance. Here, we investigate single crystals of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ by thermal expansion and magnetostriction along different crystallographic directions. These data provide compelling evidence for the formation of magnetic polarons in Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ well above the magnetic ordering temperature. More specifically, our results are consistent with anisotropic polarons with varying extent along the different crystallographic directions. A crossover revealed within the magnetically ordered phase can be associated with a surprising stabilization of ferromagnetic polarons within the global antiferromagnetic order upon decreasing temperature. These findings make Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ a rare example of such coexisting and competing magnetic orders and, importantly, shed new light on colossal magnetoresistive behavior beyond manganites.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find that the multifaractal dimension shows no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.</description>

      <title>Floquet Flux Attachment in Cold Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux attachment provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding certain forms of topological order, including most notably the fractional quantum Hall effect. Despite its ubiquitous use as a theoretical tool, directly realizing flux attachment in a microscopic setting remains an open challenge. Here, we propose a simple approach to realizing flux attachment in a periodically-driven (Floquet) system of either spins or hard-core bosons. We demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice), and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate. Finally, we propose an optical-lattice-based implementation of our model on a square lattice and discuss prospects for adiabatic preparation as well as effects of Floquet heating.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the magnetic responses of bilayer graphene from the perspective of the quantum distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of the quantum geometry on the magnetic responses of quadratic band crossing semimetals. More explicitly, we examine the Landau levels, quantum Hall effect, and magnetic susceptibility of a general two-band Hamiltonian that has fixed isotropic quadratic band dispersion but with tunable quantum geometry, in which the interband coupling is fully characterized by the maximum quantum distance $d_\mathrm{max}$. By continuously tuning $d_\mathrm{max}$ in the range of $0\leq d_\mathrm{max}\leq 1$, we investigate how the magnetic properties of the free electron model with $d_\mathrm{max}=0$ evolve into those of the bilayer graphene with $d_\mathrm{max}=1$. We demonstrate that despite sharing the same energy dispersion $\epsilon(p) =\pm\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the charge carriers in the free electron model and bilayer graphene exhibit entirely distinct Landau levels and quantum Hall responses due to the nontrivial quantum geometry of the wave functions.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Enhanced Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in a topologically non trivial band may form exotic phases of matter. An especially intriguing example of which is the fractional quantum anomalous Hall phase, recently discovered in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides and in moir\'e graphene multilayers. However, it has been shown to be destabilized in certain filling factors at sub-100 mK temperatures in pentalayer graphene, in favor of a novel integer quantum anomalous Hall phase [Z. Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203 ]. We propose that the culprit stabilizing the fractional phase at higher temperatures is its rich edge state structure. Possessing a multiplicity of chiral modes on its edge, the fractional phase has lower free energy at higher temperatures due to the excess edge modes entropy. We make distinct predictions under this scenario, including the system-size dependency of the fractional phase entropic enhancement, and how the phase boundaries change as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>
