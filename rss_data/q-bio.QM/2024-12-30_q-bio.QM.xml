      <title>Self-assembling T7 phage syringes with modular genomes for targeted delivery of penicillin against beta-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteriophages are promising alternative antimicrobial agents due to their high specificity for host bacteria and minimal immunogenicity in humans. However, their therapeutic application is limited by their nature as biological entities, which can lead to unintended evolutionary consequences such as horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we address these challenges by repurposing only the structural components of bacteriophages as vesicles to deliver antibiotics directly into the cytoplasm of bacterial hosts. This approach is based on two key hypotheses: first, antibiotics such as beta-lactams remain effective against resistant bacteria if injected directly into the cytoplasm, bypassing resistance mechanisms; second, phage structures can be synthesized and self-assembled in vitro using modular genomes and cell-free protein expression systems to carry small molecules such as antibiotics as cargo. To test these hypotheses, we utilized T7 phages and penicillin-resistant Escherichia coli as a model system. First, we designed the T7 phage genome into a modular format containing only the genes encoding structural components and synthesized the gene fragments via de novo gene synthesis. These phage structures were then rebooted in vitro using a cell-free protein expression system in the presence of penicillin G, allowing the antibiotics to be incorporated as cargo during the self-assembly process. Finally, we tested the antimicrobial activity of these antibiotic-loaded phage syringes against penicillin-resistant E. coli. The results demonstrate that phage syringes effectively reduce the population of penicillin-resistant E. coli compared to negative controls, including free penicillin and water. This study highlights the potential of using phage structures as antibiotic delivery vehicles, offering a novel strategy to overcome both antibiotic resistance and the limitations of phage therapy.</description>

      <title>MiTREE: Multi-input Transformer Ecoregion Encoder for Species Distribution Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses an extreme threat to biodiversity, making it imperative to efficiently model the geographical range of different species. The availability of large-scale remote sensing images and environmental data has facilitated the use of machine learning in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which aim to predict the presence of a species at any given location. Traditional SDMs, reliant on expert observation, are labor-intensive, but advancements in remote sensing and citizen science data have facilitated machine learning approaches to SDM development. However, these models often struggle with leveraging spatial relationships between different inputs -- for instance, learning how climate data should inform the data present in satellite imagery -- without upsampling or distorting the original inputs. Additionally, location information and ecological characteristics at a location play a crucial role in predicting species distribution models, but these aspects have not yet been incorporated into state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we introduce MiTREE: a multi-input Vision-Transformer-based model with an ecoregion encoder. MiTREE computes spatial cross-modal relationships without upsampling as well as integrates location and ecological context. We evaluate our model on the SatBird Summer and Winter datasets, the goal of which is to predict bird species encounter rates, and we find that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Gx2Mol: De Novo Generation of Hit-like Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</description>

      <title>Handwriting Anomalies and Learning Disabilities through Recurrent Neural Networks and Geometric Pattern Analysis</title>

Abstract: Dyslexia and dysgraphia are learning disabilities that profoundly impact reading, writing, and language processing capabilities. Dyslexia primarily affects reading, manifesting as difficulties in word recognition and phonological processing, where individuals struggle to connect sounds with their corresponding letters. Dysgraphia, on the other hand, affects writing skills, resulting in difficulties with letter formation, spacing, and alignment. The coexistence of dyslexia and dysgraphia complicates diagnosis, requiring a nuanced approach capable of adapting to these complexities while accurately identifying and differentiating between the disorders. This study utilizes advanced geometrical patterns and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to identify handwriting anomalies indicative of dyslexia and dysgraphia. Handwriting is first standardized, followed by feature extraction that focuses on baseline deviations, letter connectivity, stroke thickness, and other anomalies. These features are then fed into an RNN-based autoencoder to identify irregularities. Initial results demonstrate the ability of this RNN model to achieve state-of-art performance on combined dyslexia and dysgraphia detection, while showing the challenges associated with complex pattern adaptation of deep-learning to a diverse corpus of about 33,000 writing samples.</description>

      <title>Predictive Pattern Recognition Techniques Towards Spatiotemporal Representation of Plant Growth in Simulated and Controlled Environments: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate predictions and representations of plant growth patterns in simulated and controlled environments are important for addressing various challenges in plant phenomics research. This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks detects regions disrupted by neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low-dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, we define a local measure of distortion of the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain networks dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from DWI and fMRI scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method identifies more accurately the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormality detection in memory-related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing disease progression.</description>
