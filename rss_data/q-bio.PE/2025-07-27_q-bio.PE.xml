      <title>Adding a fecundity-survival trade-off to a discrete population model with maturation delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although maturation delays of new individuals are frequently added in population models, researchers rarely account for the mortality of individuals between birth and maturity. Previous studies have added mortality of immature individuals to the maturation delay in discrete population models, finding that increasing the delay results in a decreased population level at equilibrium. Furthermore, increasing the maturation delay beyond a critical threshold ultimately leads to the extinction of the modeled species. Because maturation delays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, clearly, maturation delays must also have a positive benefit leading to a trade-off. We explore such a trade-off by deriving a class of discrete single species models with a maturation delay and the realistic assumption of a reproductive trade-off. In this reproductive trade-off, although a prolonged maturation delay decreases the total probability of survival, the delay results in larger body sizes which we assume, based on some fish species, to result in higher fecundity. We examine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density dependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature individuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the Beverton-Holt model and the Ricker model. Overall, we identify a positive maturation delay that maximizes the population size, which we refer to as "optimal maturation delay".</description>

      <title>Characterizing (multi-)semi-directed phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a flexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve reticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to focus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These graphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of the arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph whose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source or root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit in nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not. In this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of semi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed graphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have more than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the theory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry picking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a (multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted network that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child, orchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural aspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved theoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within the development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such networks.</description>

      <title>A self-supervised neural-analytic method to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in Romania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.12926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysing and understanding the transmission and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory to be able to design the best social and medical policies, foresee their outcomes and deal with all the subsequent socio-economic effects. We address this important problem from a computational and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period, based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical, age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR, which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around 0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Non-Stationary Transition Probabilities in Decision Making: Modeling COVID-19 Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a comparative modeling framework using stationary and non-stationary transition probabilities within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to assess COVID-19 disease dynamics. Stationary transition probabilities assume constant transition rates, while non-stationary transitions reflect time-dependent behaviors including policy interventions or behavioral changes. We develop a comprehensive compartmental model with transitions based on binomial and multinomial processes. Mathematical models for both stationary and non-stationary transition frameworks are developed and simulated over a 365-day period to emphasize dynamic variations in epidemic outcomes. Our findings highlight the significance of non-stationary modeling in accurately representing the dynamic characteristics of pandemic situations and provide recommendations for optimizing public health interventions under uncertainty. This comparative analysis offers useful information for epidemiological modeling and decision-making in dynamic risk environments.</description>
