      <title>Orbital angular momentum enhanced laser absorption and neutron generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced absorption of near relativistic optical vortex beams in $\mathrm{D_2O}$ plasmas to generate a record fast-neutron yield of $1.45 \times 10^6$ n/s/sr. Beams with a topological charge of 5 were shown to deliver up to a 3.3 times enhancement of fast-neutron yield over a Gaussian focused beam of the same energy but having two orders of magnitude higher intensity. This result was achieved with laser energies of 16 mJ and a pulse duration of 67 fs. The Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beam-target interactions in our experiment were also investigated through Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. Electron density rippling resulting in enhanced plasma wave excitation on the critical surface and significantly enhanced resonance absorption is observed.</description>

      <title>Different kinds of accelerated propagation of relativistic electromagnetic plasma wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic electromagnetic plasma waves are described by a dynamical equation that can be solved not only in terms of plane waves, but for several different accelerating wavepacket solutions. Depending on the spatial and temporal dependence of the plasma frequency, different kinds of accelerating solution can be obtained, for example, in terms of Airy or Weber functions. Also, we show that an arbitrary accelerated wavepacket solution is possible, for example, for a system with a luminal plasma slab.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Emission from the Wakefield of CO2 Laser-Created Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-field terahertz (THz) pulse generation is investigated through the interaction of an intense single-color CO2 laser pulse with helium (He) gas targets. Employing multi-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, this study reveals a substantial enhancement in THz generation efficiency, even with a single-color laser pulse interacting with gas targets in the self-modulated-laser-wakefield (SMLWF) regime. Our study demonstrates that in the presence of photoionization, a synergistic interplay of laser self-modulation, self-focusing, and local pump depletion leads to the generation of robust THz pulses polarized parallel to the laser electric field. The dependence of THz generation efficiency on target density and laser pulse duration has been investigated. Our study identifies a favourable parametric regime for producing THz fields with amplitudes reaching hundreds of GV/m, surpassing those reported in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The available energy of a plasma is defined as the maximum amount by which the plasma energy can be lowered by volume-preserving rearrangements in phase space, a so-called Gardner re-stacking. A general expression is derived for the available energy of a nearly homogeneous plasma and is shown to be closely related to the Helmholtz free energy, which it can never exceed. A number of explicit examples are given.</description>

      <title>Electron collision studies on the CH$_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations are performed for electron collision with the methylene molecular ion CH$_2^+$ in its bent equilibrium geometry, with the goal to obtain cross sections for electron impact excitation and dissociation. The polyatomic version of the UK molecular R-matrix codes was used to perform an initial configuration-interaction calculation on the doublet and quartet states of the CH$_2^+$ ion. Subsequently, scattering calculations are performed to obtain electron impact electronic excitation and dissociation cross sections and, additionally, the bound states of the CH$_2$ molecule and Feshbach resonances in the $e$-CH$_2^+$ system.</description>

      <title>Force-free wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres: Computational modeling in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves (AWs) to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating AWs interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, AWs convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric AW crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of `bouncing' AWs by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>Solar wind data analysis aided by synthetic modeling: a better understanding of plasma-frame variations from temporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ measurements of the solar wind, a turbulent and anisotropic plasma flow originating at the Sun, are mostly carried out by single spacecraft, resulting in one-dimensional time series. The conversion of these measurements to the spatial frame of the plasma is a great challenge, but required for direct comparison of the measurements with MHD turbulence theories. Here we present a toolkit, based on the synthetic modeling of solar wind fluctuations as two-dimensional noise maps with adjustable spectral and power anisotropy, that can help with the temporal-spatial conversion of real data. Specifically, by following the spacecraft trajectory through a noise map (relative velocity and angle relative to some mean magnetic field) with properties tuned to mimic those of the solar wind, the likelihood that the temporal data fluctuations represent parallel or perpendicular fluctuations in the plasma frame can be quantified by correlating structure functions of the noise map. Synthetic temporal data can also be generated, which can provide a testing ground for analysis applied to the solar wind data. We demonstrate this tool by investigating Parker Solar Probe's E7 trajectory and data, and showcase several possible ways in which it can be used. We find that whether temporal variations in the spacecraft frame come from parallel or perpendicular variations in the plasma frame strongly depends on the spectral and power anisotropy of the measured wind. Data analysis assisted by such underlying synthetic models as presented here could open up new ways to interpret measurements in the future, specifically in the more reliable determination of plasma frame quantities from temporal measurements.</description>

      <title>Future Prospects for Partially Ionised Solar Plasmas: the Prominence Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially ionised plasmas (PIP) constitute an essential ingredient of our plasma universe. Historically, the physical effects associated with partial ionisation were considered in astrophysical topics such as the interstellar medium, molecular clouds, accretion disks and, later on, in solar physics. PIP can be found in layers of the Sun's atmosphere as well as in solar structures embedded within it. As a consequence, the dynamical behaviour of these layers and structures is influenced by the different physical effects introduced by partial ionisation.
  Here, rather than considering an exhaustive discussion of partially ionised effects in the different layers and structures of the solar atmosphere, we focus on solar prominences. The reason is that they represent a paradigmatic case of a partially ionised solar plasma, confined and insulated by the magnetic field, constituting an ideal environment to study the effects induced by partial ionisation. We present the current knowledge about the effects of partial ionisation in the global stability, mass cycle and dynamics of solar prominences. We revise the identified observational signatures of partial ionisation in prominences. We conclude with prospects for PIP research in prominences, proposing the path for advancing in the prominence modelling and theory and using new and upcoming instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Dense polarized positrons from beam-solid interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic positron sources with high spin polarization have important applications in nuclear and particle physics and many frontier fields. However, it is challenging to produce dense polarized positrons. Here we present a simple and effective method to achieve such a positron source by directly impinging a relativistic high-density electron beam on the surface of a solid target. During the interaction, a strong return current of plasma electrons is induced and subsequently asymmetric quasistatic magnetic fields as high as megatesla are generated along the target surface. This gives rise to strong radiative spin flips and multiphoton processes, thus leading to efficient generation of copious polarized positrons. With three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate the production of a dense highly-polarized multi-GeV positron beam with an average spin polarization above 40% and nC-scale charge per shot. This offers a novel route for the studies of laserless strong-field quantum electrodynamics physics and for the development of high-energy polarized positron sources.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic Grad-Shafranov equation for quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-order model is derived for quasisymmetric stellarators where the vacuum field due to coils is dominant, but plasma-current-induced terms are not negligible and can contribute to magnetic differential equations, with $\beta$ of the order of the ratio of induced to vacuum fields. Under these assumptions, it is proven that the aspect ratio must be large and a simple expression can be obtained for the lowest-order vacuum field. The first-order correction, which involves both vacuum and current-driven fields, is governed by a Grad-Shafranov equation and the requirement that flux surfaces exist. These two equations are not always consistent, and so this model is generally overconstrained, but special solutions exist that satisfy both equations simultaneously. One family of such solutions are the first-order near-axis solutions. Thus, the first-order near-axis model is a subset of the model presented here. Several other solutions outside the scope of the near-axis model are also found. A case study comparing one such solution to a VMEC-generated solution shows good agreement.</description>

Abstract: The ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) set off a global wave of research on the inertial fusion energy (IFE). However, IFE requires a necessary target gain G of 30-100, while it is hard to achieve the fusions at such high gain with the energy, configuration, and technical route of the NIF. We will present a conceptual design for the next generation laser driver of 10 MJ, 2~3 PW at the laser wavelength of 0.353 micrometer (or 0.353 micrometer, then the energy and power can be higher), and 1 shot per 30 minutes, which is efficient, compact, low-cost, low laser-plasma instabilities, applicable to multiple laser fusion schemes, and aiming for G &gt; 30.</description>

      <title>Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity has been studied using results of numerical simulations, laboratory measurements, solar, solar wind, the Earth's and planets' magnetosphere observations (spacecraft measurements), and the global magnetic observatory network. The spectral data have been compared with the theoretical results based on the distributed chaos notion in the frames of the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology. The transition from magnetohydrodynamics to kinetics in the electron and Hall magnetohydrodynamics, and in a fully kinetic 3D approach, as well as in the solar wind, solar photosphere, and at the special events (reconnections, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, isolated flux tube interchanges, etc.) in the magnetosphere of Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury has been studied using the above-mentioned data. Despite the considerable differences in the physical parameters and scales, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the observational data in the frames of the magneto-inertial range notion. Temporal variability of the magnetic field at Earth's surface under the influence of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and solar wind has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interplay with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such an interplay has not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of thermal convection and compare the results with our experimental data published before. We show that the critical Hartmann number ($Ha$) for the onset of AMRI is reduced by convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between $m = \pm 1$ instability modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave appear as a ``one-winged butterfly''.</description>

Abstract: The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal resistance.
