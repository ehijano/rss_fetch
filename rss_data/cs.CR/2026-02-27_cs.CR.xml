      <description>arXiv:2602.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha-Root is a cybersecurity-focused dataset collected in a single shot from the Common Crawl web graph using community detection. Unlike iterative content-scoring approaches like DeepSeekMath, we mine quality domains directly from the web graph, starting from just 20 trusted seed domains.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multichain Blockchain: A Multiobjective Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains are widely used for secure transaction processing, but their scalability remains limited, and existing multichain designs are typically static even as demand and capacity shift. We cast blockchain configuration as a multiagent resource-allocation problem: applications and operators declare demand, capacity, and price bounds; an optimizer groups them into ephemeral chains each epoch and sets a chain-level clearing price. The objective maximizes a governance-weighted combination of normalized utilities for applications, operators, and the system. The model is modular -- accommodating capability compatibility, application-type diversity, and epoch-to-epoch stability -- and can be solved off-chain with outcomes verifiable on-chain. We analyze fairness and incentive issues and present simulations that highlight trade-offs among throughput, decentralization, operator yield, and service stability.</description>

      <title>Optimized Disaster Recovery for Distributed Storage Systems: Lightweight Metadata Architectures to Overcome Cryptographic Hashing Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed storage architectures are foundational to modern cloud-native infrastructure, yet a critical operational bottleneck persists within disaster recovery (DR) workflows: the dependence on content-based cryptographic hashing for data identification and synchronization. While hash-based deduplication is effective for storage efficiency in steady-state operation, it becomes a systemic liability during failover and failback events when hash indexes are stale, incomplete, or must be rebuilt following a crash. This paper precisely characterizes the operational conditions under which full or partial re-hashing becomes unavoidable. The paper also analyzes the downstream impact of cryptographic re-hashing on Recovery Time Objective (RTO) compliance, and proposes a generalized architectural shift toward deterministic, metadata-driven identification. The proposed framework assigns globally unique composite identifiers to data blocks at ingestion time-independent of content analysis enabling instantaneous delta computation during DR without any cryptographic overhead.</description>

      <title>TT-SEAL: TTD-Aware Selective Encryption for Adversarially-Robust and Low-Latency Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-edge AI must jointly satisfy model compression and security under tight device budgets. While Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD) shrinks on-device models, prior selective-encryption studies largely assume dense weights, leaving its practicality under TTD compression unclear. We present TT-SEAL, a selective-encryption framework for TT-decomposed networks. TT-SEAL ranks TT cores with a sensitivity-based importance metric, calibrates a one-time robustness threshold, and uses a value-DP optimizer to encrypt the minimum set of critical cores with AES. Under TTD-aware, transfer-based threat models (and on an FPGA-prototyped edge processor) TT-SEAL matches the robustness of full (black-box) encryption while encrypting as little as 4.89-15.92% of parameters across ResNet-18, MobileNetV2, and VGG-16, and drives the share of AES decryption in end-to-end latency to low single digits (e.g., 58% -&gt; 2.76% on ResNet-18), enabling secure, low-latency edge AI.</description>

      <title>Analysis of LLMs Against Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in real-world systems. Given their broader applicability, prompt engineering has become an efficient tool for resource-scarce organizations to adopt LLMs for their own purposes. At the same time, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Thus, analyzing this risk has become a critical security requirement. This work evaluates prompt-injection and jailbreak vulnerability using a large, manually curated dataset across multiple open-source LLMs, including Phi, Mistral, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.2, Qwen, and Gemma variants. We observe significant behavioural variation across models, including refusal responses and complete silent non-responsiveness triggered by internal safety mechanisms. Furthermore, we evaluated several lightweight, inference-time defence mechanisms that operate as filters without any retraining or GPU-intensive fine-tuning. Although these defences mitigate straightforward attacks, they are consistently bypassed by long, reasoning-heavy prompts.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Incident Response: A Hybrid Approach for Data Breach Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires organisations to notify supervisory authorities of personal data breaches within 72 hours of discovery. Meeting this strict deadline is challenging because incident responders must manually translate low-level forensic artefacts such as malware traces, system-call logs, and network captures into the structured, legally framed information required by data-protection authorities. This gap between technical evidence and regulatory reporting often results in delays, incomplete notifications, and a high cognitive burden on analysts. We propose a hybrid malware analysis pipeline that automates the extraction and organisation of breach-relevant information, with a particular focus on exfiltration-oriented Linux/ARM malware, which is rapidly increasing in prevalence due to the widespread adoption of IoT and embedded devices. The system combines static analysis to identify potential exfiltrators with dynamic analysis to reconstruct their behaviour. It employs a Large Language Model (LLM) constrained by a formal JSON schema aligned with the official Italian Garante Privacy notification form. The LLM transforms heterogeneous forensic artefacts into a structured, compliance-ready report that a human operator can rapidly validate.</description>

      <title>Self-Purification Mitigates Backdoors in Multimodal Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to their autoregressive counterparts. Yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that well-established data-poisoning pipelines can successfully implant backdoors into MDLMs, enabling attackers to manipulate model behavior via specific triggers while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. However, defense strategies effective to these models are yet to emerge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a backdoor defense framework for MDLMs named DiSP (Diffusion Self-Purification). DiSP is driven by a key observation: selectively masking certain vision tokens at inference time can neutralize a backdoored model's trigger-induced behaviors and restore normal functionality. Building on this, we purify the poisoned dataset using the compromised model itself, then fine-tune the model on the purified data to recover it to a clean one. Given such a specific design, DiSP can remove backdoors without requiring any auxiliary models or clean reference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates backdoor effects, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) from over 90% to typically under 5%, while maintaining model performance on benign tasks.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Defense Mechanism against Next Generation of Phishing Emails using Distilled Attention-Augmented BiLSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current generation of large language models produces sophisticated social-engineering content that bypasses standard text screening systems in business communication platforms. Our proposed solution for mail gateway and endpoint deception detection operates in a privacy-protective manner while handling the performance requirements of network and mobile security systems. The MobileBERT teacher receives fine-tuning before its transformation into a BiLSTM model with multi-head attention which maintains semantic discrimination only with 4.5 million parameters. The hybrid dataset contains human-written messages together with LLM-generated paraphrases that use masking techniques and personalization methods to enhance modern attack resistance. The evaluation system uses five testing protocols which include human-only and LLM-only tests and two cross-distribution transfer tests and a production-like mixed traffic test to assess performance in native environments and across different distribution types and combined traffic scenarios. The distilled model maintains a weighted-F1 score difference of 1-2.5 points compared to the mixture split results of strong transformer baselines including ModernBERT, DeBERTaV3-base, T5-base, DeepSeek-R1 Distill Qwen-1.5B and Phi-4 mini while achieving 80-95\% faster inference times and 95-99\% smaller model sizes. The system demonstrates excellent performance in terms of accuracy and latency while maintaining a compact size which enables real-time filtering without acceleration hardware and supports policy-based management. The paper examines system performance under high traffic conditions and security measures for privacy protection and implementation methods for operational deployment.</description>

      <title>Poisoned Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-data poisoning attacks can induce targeted, undetectable failure in deep neural networks by corrupting a vanishingly small fraction of training labels. We demonstrate this on acoustic vehicle classification using the MELAUDIS urban intersection dataset (approx. 9,600 audio clips, 6 classes): a compact 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on log-mel spectrograms achieves 95.7% Attack Success Rate (ASR) -- the fraction of target-class test samples misclassified under the attack -- on a Truck-to-Car label-flipping attack at just p=0.5% corruption (48 records), with zero detectable change in aggregate accuracy (87.6% baseline; 95% CI: 88-100%, n=3 seeds). We prove this stealth is structural: the maximum accuracy drop from a complete targeted attack is bounded above by the minority class fraction (beta). For real-world class imbalances (Truck approx. 3%), this bound falls below training-run noise, making aggregate accuracy monitoring provably insufficient regardless of architecture or attack method. A companion backdoor trigger attack reveals a novel trigger-dominance collapse: when the target class is a dataset minority, the spectrogram patch trigger becomes functionally redundant--clean ASR equals triggered ASR, and the attack degenerates to pure label flipping. We formalize the ML training pipeline as an attack surface and propose a trust-minimized defense combining content-addressed artifact hashing, Merkle-tree dataset commitment, and post-quantum digital signatures (ML-DSA-65/CRYSTALS-Dilithium3, NIST FIPS 204) for cryptographically verifiable data provenance.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Truncation of Unbounded Data via Public Second Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data privacy is important in the AI era, and differential privacy (DP) is one of the golden solutions. However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.</description>

      <title>HubScan: Detecting Hubness Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential to contemporary AI applications, allowing large language models to obtain external knowledge via vector similarity search. Nevertheless, these systems encounter a significant security flaw: hubness - items that frequently appear in the top-k retrieval results for a disproportionately high number of varied queries. These hubs can be exploited to introduce harmful content, alter search rankings, bypass content filtering, and decrease system performance.
  We introduce hubscan, an open-source security scanner that evaluates vector indices and embeddings to identify hubs in RAG systems. Hubscan presents a multi-detector architecture that integrates: (1) robust statistical hubness detection utilizing median/MAD-based z-scores, (2) cluster spread analysis to assess cross-cluster retrieval patterns, (3) stability testing under query perturbations, and (4) domain-aware and modality-aware detection for category-specific and cross-modal attacks. Our solution accommodates several vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and offers versatile retrieval techniques, including vector similarity, hybrid search, and lexical matching with reranking capabilities.
  We evaluate hubscan on Food-101, MS-COCO, and FiQA adversarial hubness benchmarks constructed using state-of-the-art gradient-optimized and centroid-based hub generation methods. hubscan achieves 90% recall at a 0.2% alert budget and 100% recall at 0.4%, with adversarial hubs ranking above the 99.8th percentile. Domain-scoped scanning recovers 100% of targeted attacks that evade global detection. Production validation on 1M real web documents from MS MARCO demonstrates significant score separation between clean documents and adversarial content. Our work provides a practical, extensible framework for detecting hubness threats in production RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Known Vulnerabilities from Attack Descriptions Using Sentence Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern infrastructures rely on software systems that remain vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks frequently exploit vulnerabilities documented in repositories such as MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). However, Cyber Threat Intelligence resources, including MITRE ATT&amp;CK and CVE, provide only partial coverage of attack-vulnerability relationships. Attack information often appears before vulnerabilities are formally linked, creating the need for automated methods that infer likely vulnerabilities directly from attack descriptions.
  This thesis addresses the problem of predicting known vulnerabilities from natural-language descriptions of cyberattacks. We develop transformer-based sentence embedding methods that encode attack and vulnerability descriptions into semantic vector representations, enabling similarity-based ranking and recommendation.
  Fourteen state-of-the-art transformer models were evaluated across four attack description types (Tactic, Technique, Procedure, and Attack Pattern). Results show that Technique descriptions in MITRE ATT&amp;CK provide the strongest predictive signal. The multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieved the best performance due to its hybrid pre-training and optimization for semantic similarity.
  The approach was implemented in the VULDAT tool, which automatically links attacks to vulnerabilities. Manual validation revealed previously undocumented relationships in MITRE repositories. Evaluation on unseen cyberattack reports demonstrates that the models generalize beyond curated datasets and support proactive vulnerability awareness.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Data-Driven Markov Chain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chains model a wide range of user behaviors. However, generating accurate Markov chain models requires substantial user data, and sharing these models without privacy protections may reveal sensitive information about the underlying user data. We introduce a method for protecting user data used to formulate a Markov chain model. First, we develop a method for privatizing database queries whose outputs are elements of the unit simplex, and we prove that this method is differentially private. We quantify its accuracy by bounding the expected KL divergence between private and non-private queries. We extend this method to privatize stochastic matrices whose rows are each a simplex-valued query of a database, which includes data-driven Markov chain models. To assess their accuracy, we analytically bound the change in the stationary distribution and the change in the convergence rate between a non-private Markov chain model and its private form. Simulations show that under a typical privacy implementation, our method yields less than 2% error in the stationary distribution, indicating that our approach to private modeling faithfully captures the behavior of the systems we study.</description>

      <title>Silent Egress: When Implicit Prompt Injection Makes LLM Agents Leak Without a Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic large language model systems increasingly automate tasks by retrieving URLs and calling external tools. We show that this workflow gives rise to implicit prompt injection: adversarial instructions embedded in automatically generated URL previews, including titles, metadata, and snippets, can introduce a system-level risk that we refer to as silent egress. Using a fully local and reproducible testbed, we demonstrate that a malicious web page can induce an agent to issue outbound requests that exfiltrate sensitive runtime context, even when the final response shown to the user appears harmless. In 480 experimental runs with a qwen2.5:7b-based agent, the attack succeeds with high probability (P (egress) =0.89), and 95% of successful attacks are not detected by output-based safety checks. We also introduce sharded exfiltration, where sensitive information is split across multiple requests to avoid detection. This strategy reduces single-request leakage metrics by 73% (Leak@1) and bypasses simple data loss prevention mechanisms. Our ablation results indicate that defenses applied at the prompt layer offer limited protection, while controls at the system and network layers, such as domain allowlisting and redirect-chain analysis, are considerably more effective. These findings suggest that network egress should be treated as a first-class security outcome in agentic LLM systems. We outline architectural directions, including provenance tracking and capability isolation, that go beyond prompt-level hardening.</description>

      <title>Explainability-Aware Evaluation of Transfer Learning Models for IoT DDoS Detection Under Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks threaten the availability of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, particularly under resource-constrained deployment conditions. Although transfer learning models have shown promising detection accuracy, their reliability, computational feasibility, and interpretability in operational environments remain insufficiently explored. This study presents an explainability-aware empirical evaluation of seven pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures for multi-class IoT DDoS detection using the CICDDoS2019 dataset and an image-based traffic representation. The analysis integrates performance metrics, reliability-oriented statistics (MCC, Youden Index, confidence intervals), latency and training cost assessment, and interpretability evaluation using Grad-CAM and SHAP. Results indicate that DenseNet and MobileNet-based architectures achieve strong detection performance while demonstrating superior reliability and compact, class-consistent attribution patterns. DenseNet169 offers the strongest reliability and interpretability alignment, whereas MobileNetV3 provides an effective latency-accuracy trade-off for fog-level deployment. The findings emphasize the importance of combining performance, reliability, and explainability criteria when selecting deep learning models for IoT DDoS detection.</description>

      <title>Systems-Level Attack Surface of Edge Agent Deployments on IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge deployment of LLM agents on IoT hardware introduces attack surfaces absent from cloud-hosted orchestration. We present an empirical security analysis of three architectures (cloud-hosted, edge-local swarm, and hybrid) using a multi-device home-automation testbed with local MQTT messaging and an Android smartphone as an edge inference node. We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Layer-Targeted Multilingual Knowledge Erasure in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) fails to generalize across languages: knowledge erased in one language frequently remains accessible through others. However, the underlying cause of this failure and a principled solution remain open. In this work, we identify intervention depth as the key factor determining multilingual generalization. Through systematic layer-wise experiments, we characterize two distinct failure modes: shallow-layer interventions achieve erasure but collapse multilingual capabilities in held-out languages, while deep-layer interventions preserve utility but fail to erase target knowledge even in source languages. These findings reveal that the choice of intervention layer is not a free parameter; it fundamentally determines whether multilingual unlearning succeeds. We propose MUTE (Multilingual Unlearning via Targeted Erasure), a framework that uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Linguistic Regions Development Score (LRDS) to identify intermediate, language-agnostic layers where cross-lingual representations converge. By restricting unlearning updates to these layers, MUTE achieves robust multilingual knowledge erasure while optimizing on only a small set of source languages. Extensive experiments across three LLM architectures and three unlearning algorithms validate our approach, with mechanistic analysis via Logit Lens probing confirming genuine knowledge removal rather than output-level suppression.</description>

      <title>DPSQL+: A Differentially Private SQL Library with a Minimum Frequency Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SQL is the de facto interface for exploratory data analysis; however, releasing exact query results can expose sensitive information through membership or attribute inference attacks. Differential privacy (DP) provides rigorous privacy guarantees, but in practice, DP alone may not satisfy governance requirements such as the \emph{minimum frequency rule}, which requires each released group (cell) to include contributions from at least $k$ distinct individuals. In this paper, we present \textbf{DPSQL+}, a privacy-preserving SQL library that simultaneously enforces user-level $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and the minimum frequency rule. DPSQL+ adopts a modular architecture consisting of: (i) a \emph{Validator} that statically restricts queries to a DP-safe subset of SQL; (ii) an \emph{Accountant} that consistently tracks cumulative privacy loss across multiple queries; and (iii) a \emph{Backend} that interfaces with various database engines, ensuring portability and extensibility. Experiments on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that DPSQL+ achieves practical accuracy across a wide range of analytical workloads -- from basic aggregates to quadratic statistics and join operations -- and allows substantially more queries under a fixed global privacy budget than prior libraries in our evaluation.</description>

      <title>IMMACULATE: A Practical LLM Auditing Framework via Verifiable Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial large language models are typically deployed as black-box API services, requiring users to trust providers to execute inference correctly and report token usage honestly. We present IMMACULATE, a practical auditing framework that detects economically motivated deviations-such as model substitution, quantization abuse, and token overbilling-without trusted hardware or access to model internals. IMMACULATE selectively audits a small fraction of requests using verifiable computation, achieving strong detection guarantees while amortizing cryptographic overhead. Experiments on dense and MoE models show that IMMACULATE reliably distinguishes benign and malicious executions with under 1% throughput overhead. Our code is published at https://github.com/guo-yanpei/Immaculate.</description>

      <title>AgentSentry: Mitigating Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents via Temporal Causal Diagnostics and Context Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover. It localizes takeover points via controlled counterfactual re-executions at tool-return boundaries and enables safe continuation through causally guided context purification that removes attack-induced deviations while preserving task-relevant evidence. We evaluate AgentSentry on the \textsc{AgentDojo} benchmark across four task suites, three IPI attack families, and multiple black-box LLMs. AgentSentry eliminates successful attacks and maintains strong utility under attack, achieving an average Utility Under Attack (UA) of 74.55 %, improving UA by 20.8 to 33.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines without degrading benign performance.</description>

      <title>Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Deep Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, software vulnerabilities are discovered, which pose significant risks of exploitation and system compromise. We present a convolutional neural network model that can successfully identify bugs in C code. We trained our model using two complementary datasets: a machine-labeled dataset created by Draper Labs using three static analyzers and the NIST SATE Juliet human-labeled dataset designed for testing static analyzers. In contrast with the work of Russell et al. on these datasets, we focus on C programs, enabling us to specialize and optimize our detection techniques for this language. After removing duplicates from the dataset, we tokenize the input into 91 token categories. The category values are converted to a binary vector to save memory. Our first convolution layer is chosen so that the entire encoding of the token is presented to the filter. We use two convolution and pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers to classify programs into either a common weakness enumeration category or as ``clean.'' We obtain higher recall than prior work by Russell et al. on this dataset when requiring high precision. We also demonstrate on a custom Linux kernel dataset that we are able to find real vulnerabilities in complex code with a low false-positive rate.</description>

      <title>SettleFL: Trustless and Scalable Reward Settlement Protocol for Federated Learning on Permissionless Blockchains (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open Federated Learning (FL) environments where no central authority exists, ensuring collaboration fairness relies on decentralized reward settlement, yet the prohibitive cost of permissionless blockchains directly clashes with the high-frequency, iterative nature of model training. Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-chain costs. To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination. We conduct extensive experiments combining real FL workloads and controlled simulations. Results show that SettleFL remains practical when scaling to 800 participants, achieving substantially lower gas cost.</description>

      <title>Strengthening security and noise resistance in one-way quantum key distribution protocols through hypercube-based quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a foundational cryptographic protocol that ensures information-theoretic security. However, classical protocols such as BB84, though favored for their simplicity, offer limited resistance to eavesdropping, and perform poorly under realistic noise conditions. Recent research has explored the use of discrete-time Quantum Walks (QWs) to enhance QKD schemes. In this work, we specifically focus on a one-way QKD protocol, where security depends exclusively on the underlying Quantum Walk (QW) topology, rather than the details of the protocol itself. Our paper introduces a novel protocol based on QWs over a hypercube topology and demonstrates that, under identical parameters, it provides significantly enhanced security and noise resistance compared to the circular topology (i.e., state-of-the-art), thereby strengthening protection against eavesdropping. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and extensible simulation framework for one-way QKD protocols based on QWs, supporting both circular and hypercube topologies. Implemented with IBM's software development kit for quantum computing (i.e., Qiskit), our toolkit enables noise-aware analysis under realistic noise models. To support reproducibility and future developments, we release our entire simulation framework as open-source. This contribution establishes a foundation for the design of topology-aware QKD protocols that combine enhanced noise tolerance with topologically driven security.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technology that ensures secure communication by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem and quantum uncertainty. This chapter provides an overview of this quantum technology's maturity and trends. It highlights significant advancements in single-photon sources and detection technologies that have brought QKD closer to widespread adoption, including real-world deployments by industry leaders. While addressing challenges such as cost, integration, standardization, and the need for quantum repeaters, the chapter emphasizes the growing importance of QKD in securing mission-critical communications against future quantum threats. Through its unique ability to achieve information-theoretic security, QKD is poised to play a vital role in quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms and protocols.</description>

      <title>FHECore: Rethinking GPU Microarchitecture for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation directly on encrypted data but incurs massive computational and memory overheads, often exceeding plaintext execution by several orders of magnitude. While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.
  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\times$ and $2.12\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\%$ area overhead.</description>

      <title>Manifold of Failure: Behavioral Attraction Basins in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Beyond performance-wise Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.</description>

      <title>No Caption, No Problem: Caption-Free Membership Inference via Model-Fitted Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.</description>

      <title>RandSet: Randomized Corpus Reduction for Fuzzing Seed Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seed explosion is a fundamental problem in fuzzing seed scheduling, where a fuzzer maintains a huge corpus and fails to choose promising seeds. Existing works focus on seed prioritization but still suffer from seed explosion since corpus size remains huge. We tackle this from a new perspective: corpus reduction, i.e., computing a seed corpus subset. However, corpus reduction could lead to poor seed diversity and large runtime overhead. Prior techniques like cull_queue, AFL-Cmin, and MinSet suffer from poor diversity or prohibitive overhead, making them unsuitable for high-frequency seed scheduling.
  We propose RandSet, a novel randomized corpus reduction technique that reduces corpus size and yields diverse seed selection simultaneously with minimal overhead. Our key insight is introducing randomness into corpus reduction to enjoy two benefits of a randomized algorithm: randomized output (diverse seed selection) and low runtime cost. Specifically, we formulate corpus reduction as a set cover problem and compute a randomized subset covering all features of the entire corpus. We then schedule seeds from this small, randomized subset rather than the entire corpus, effectively mitigating seed explosion.
  We implement RandSet on three popular fuzzers: AFL++, LibAFL, and Centipede, and evaluate it on standalone programs, FuzzBench, and Magma. Results show RandSet achieves significantly more diverse seed selection than other reduction techniques, with average subset ratios of 4.03% and 5.99% on standalone and FuzzBench programs. RandSet achieves a 16.58% coverage gain on standalone programs and up to 3.57% on FuzzBench in AFL++, triggers up to 7 more ground-truth bugs than the state-of-the-art on Magma, while introducing only 1.17%-3.93% overhead.</description>

      <title>Obscure but Effective: Classical Chinese Jailbreak Prompt Optimization via Bio-Inspired Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.</description>

      <title>A High-Throughput AES-GCM Implementation on GPUs for Secure, Policy-Based Access to Massive Astronomical Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.
  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.
  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.</description>

      <title>Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Private Image Generation via Coarse-to-Fine Wavelet Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.</description>

      <title>LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.
  This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an ``oracle function'', which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight IDS for Early APT Detection Using a Novel Feature Selection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a multistage, highly sophisticated, and covert form of cyber threat that gains unauthorized access to networks to either steal valuable data or disrupt the targeted network. These threats often remain undetected for extended periods, emphasizing the critical need for early detection in networks to mitigate potential APT consequences. In this work, we propose a feature selection method for developing a lightweight intrusion detection system capable of effectively identifying APTs at the initial compromise stage. Our approach leverages the XGBoost algorithm and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically utilizing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method for identifying the most relevant features of the initial compromise stage. The results of our proposed method showed the ability to reduce the selected features of the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset from 77 to just four while maintaining consistent evaluation metrics for the suggested system. The estimated metrics values are 97% precision, 100% recall, and a 98% F1 score. The proposed method not only aids in preventing successful APT consequences but also enhances understanding of APT behavior at early stages.</description>

      <title>Cyber Attacks Detection, Prevention, and Source Localization in Digital Substation Communication using Hybrid Statistical-Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</description>

      <title>PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII) from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference. Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.</description>

      <title>DropVLA: An Action-Level Backdoor Attack on Vision--Language--Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models map multimodal perception and language instructions to executable robot actions, making them particularly vulnerable to behavioral backdoor manipulation: a hidden trigger introduced during training can induce unintended physical actions while nominal task performance remains intact. Prior work on VLA backdoors primarily studies untargeted attacks or task-level hijacking, leaving fine-grained control over individual actions largely unexplored. In this work, we present DropVLA, an action-level backdoor attack that forces a reusable action primitive (e.g., open_gripper) to execute at attacker-chosen decision points under a realistic pipeline-black-box setting with limited data-poisoning access, using a window-consistent relabeling scheme for chunked fine-tuning. On OpenVLA-7B evaluated with LIBERO, vision-only poisoning achieves 98.67%-99.83% attack success rate (ASR) with only 0.31% poisoned episodes while preserving 98.50%-99.17% clean-task retention, and successfully triggers the targeted action within 25 control steps at 500 Hz (0.05 s). Text-only triggers are unstable at low poisoning budgets, and combining text with vision provides no consistent ASR improvement over vision-only attacks. The backdoor remains robust to moderate trigger variations and transfers across evaluation suites (96.27%, 99.09%), whereas text-only largely fails (0.72%). We further validate physical-world feasibility on a 7-DoF Franka arm with pi0-fast, demonstrating non-trivial attack efficacy under camera-relative motion that induces image-plane trigger drift. These results reveal that VLA models can be covertly steered at the granularity of safety-critical actions with minimal poisoning and without observable degradation of nominal performance.</description>

      <title>ACE-GF: A Generative Framework for Atomic Cryptographic Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous digital entities require deterministic identity mechanisms that avoid persistent storage of high-value master secrets, while supporting credential rotation and cryptographic agility across heterogeneous systems. Existing deterministic key hierarchies and centralized key management systems typically rely on long-lived root secrets, introducing structural single points of failure and complicating lifecycle management.
  We present ACE-GF (Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework), a seed-storage-free identity construction that enables deterministic and context-isolated key derivation without storing any master secret at rest. The construction reconstructs an identity root ephemerally in memory from a sealed artifact and authorization credentials, using misuse-resistant authenticated encryption together with standard key derivation primitives. Derived keys are generated via HKDF with explicit context encoding, ensuring cryptographic isolation across curves and application domains.
  This design naturally supports stateless credential rotation, authorization-bound revocation, and non-disruptive migration toward post-quantum cryptographic domains. Furthermore, the framework's parametric agility allows for optimization in resource-constrained environments, ensuring that deterministic identity reconstruction remains viable across a spectrum of hardware from high-performance servers to low-power IoT nodes without compromising the underlying security model.
  This work builds upon the conceptual framework introduced in MSCIKDF, which identified the core design goals for multi-curve, context-isolated, PQC-pluggable identity but did not provide a concrete construction. A formal protocol specification of ACE-GF has been submitted as an IETF Internet-Draft.</description>

      <title>Towards Small Language Models for Security Query Generation in SOC Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysts in Security Operations Centers routinely query massive telemetry streams using Kusto Query Language (KQL). Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale. This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.</description>

      <title>Large-scale online deanonymization with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to classical deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>MemoPhishAgent: Memory-Augmented Multi-Modal LLM Agent for Phishing URL Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional phishing website detection relies on static heuristics or reference lists, which lag behind rapidly evolving attacks. While recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs), they are still prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that underutilize reasoning capability. We present MemoPhishAgent (MPA), a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent that dynamically orchestrates phishing-specific tools and leverages episodic memories of past reasoning trajectories to guide decisions on recurring and novel threats. On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Guaranteed Label Unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning: Few-Shot Forgetting without Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), a setting that has received far less attention than its horizontal counterpart. Specifically, we propose the first method tailored to \textit{label unlearning} in VFL, where labels play a dual role as both essential inputs and sensitive information. To this end, we employ a representation-level manifold mixup mechanism to generate synthetic embeddings for both unlearned and retained samples. This is to provide richer signals for the subsequent gradient-based label forgetting and recovery steps. These augmented embeddings are then subjected to gradient-based label forgetting, effectively removing the associated label information from the model. To recover performance on the retained data, we introduce a recovery-phase optimization step that refines the remaining embeddings. This design achieves effective label unlearning while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ModelNet, Brain Tumor MRI, COVID-19 Radiography, and Yahoo Answers demonstrate strong efficacy and scalability. Overall, this work establishes a new direction for unlearning in VFL, showing that re-imagining mixup as an efficient mechanism can unlock practical and utility-preserving unlearning.

      <title>Differential Privacy of Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Recommendation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the differential privacy (DP) of the quantum recommendation algorithm of Kerenidis--Prakash and its quantum-inspired classical counterpart. Under standard low-rank and incoherence assumptions on the preference matrix, we show that the randomness already present in the algorithms' measurement/$\ell_2$-sampling steps can act as a privacy-curating mechanism, yielding $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP without injecting additional DP noise through the interface. Concretely, for a system with $m$ users and $n$ items and rank parameter $k$, we prove $\varepsilon=\mathcal O(\sqrt{k/n})$ and $\delta= \mathcal O\big(k^2/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$; in the typical regime $k=\mathrm{polylog}(m,n)$ this simplifies to $\varepsilon=\tilde{\mathcal O}(1/\sqrt n)$ and $\delta=\tilde{\mathcal O}\big(1/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$. Our analysis introduces a perturbation technique for truncated SVD under a single-entry update, which tracks the induced change in the low-rank reconstruction while avoiding unstable singular-vector comparisons. Finally, we validate the scaling on real-world rating datasets and compare against classical DP recommender baselines.</description>

      <title>Chameleon Channels: Measuring YouTube Accounts Repurposed for Deception and Profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online content creators spend significant time and effort building their user base through a long, often arduous process that requires finding the right "niche" to cater to. So, what incentive is there for an established content creator known for cat memes to completely reinvent their channel and start promoting cryptocurrency services or covering electoral news events?
  We explore this problem of repurposed channels, whereby a channel changes its identity and contents. We first characterize a market for "second-hand" social media accounts, which recorded sales exceeding USD 1M during our 6-month observation period. Observing YouTube channels (re)sold over these 6 months, we find that a substantial number (53%) are used to disseminate policy-sensitive content, often without facing any penalty. Surprisingly, these channels seem to gain rather than lose subscribers.
  We estimate the prevalence of repurposing using two snapshots of ~1.4M YouTube accounts sampled from an ecologically valid proxy. In a 3-month period, we estimate that ~0.25% channels were repurposed. We experimentally confirm that these repurposed channels share several characteristics with sold channels -- mainly, they have a significantly high presence of policy-sensitive content. Across repurposed channels, we find channels similar to those used in influence operations, as well as channels used for financial scams. Repurposed channels have large audiences; across two observed samples, repurposed channels held ~193M and ~44M subscribers. We reason that purchasing an existing audience and the credibility associated with an established account is advantageous to financially- and ideologically-motivated adversaries. This phenomenon is not exclusive to YouTube and we posit that the market for cultivating organic audiences is set to grow, particularly if it remains unchallenged by mitigations, technical or otherwise.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets. The dataset is presented at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NewCityLetter/RMS2/tree/main.</description>
