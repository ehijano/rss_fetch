      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Pauli Spin Blockade and Current Rectification in 15-13-15 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structures and charge transport properties of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices using a tight-binding model. The conduction and valence subbands of the 15-13-15 AGNR superlattice are found to be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, with topologically protected interface states forming at the junctions between 15- and 13-AGNR segments. We demonstrate that these interface states function as robust tunneling channels, behaving as a serial double quantum dot (SDQD) system under appropriate electrode coupling. Utilizing the two-site Anderson model with electron-electron interactions and Keldysh Green function formalism, we analyze nonlinear charge transport and reveal Coulomb blockade phenomena and charge stability diagrams consistent with experimental observations. Particular attention is given to temperature-dependent current rectification in the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) regime, where significant rectification is preserved under weak orbital offset conditions but suppressed under strong offset, replaced by thermally activated tunneling at room temperature. The tunability and resilience of SDQDs based on 15-13-15 AGNR heterostructures highlight their potential for spin-current conversion applications, with advantages in fabrication and parameter control offered by bottom-up synthesis techniques.</description>

      <title>Transition from near-field to extreme near-field radiative heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative heat transfer in the extreme near-field regime, i.e. for distances below 10 nm, remains poorly understood. There are competing experimental results in this regime, with some in good agreement with theoretical predictions, while others report drastically elevated heat fluxes, orders of magnitude larger than what theory suggests. Whether the theory of fluctuational electrodynamics can predict the radiative heat transfer in this extreme near-field regime or not remains a matter of active debate. In this study, a radiative heat transfer measurement is presented between a gold-coated sphere and a gold film sample in the transition regime between the near-field and the extreme near-field regime just before contact. The radiative heat flux measurement is made by using a near-field scanning thermal microscope equipped with a temperature sensor at a sharp tip as a heat flux sensor. We find an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of fluctuational electrodynamics in the near-field regime. In the extreme near-field regime however, a highly increased radiative heat flux is observed with values about 100 times larger than the theoretical predictions, indicating that fluctuational electrodynamics fails to capture the radiative heat flux in this regime.</description>

      <title>Landau levels in Weyl semimetal under uniaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The external strain can lead to the similar effect to the external applied magnetic field. Such pseudomagnetic field can be larger than typical magnetic fields, what gives the opportunity to experimentally study the Landau levels. In this paper we study the effects of uniaxial strain on the Weyl nodes, using continuum and lattice model. In the continuum model we show that the uniaxial strain leads to magnetic field renormalization, which in practice corresponds to the shift of the Landau levels to higher energy. We also investigate type-I and type-II Weyl nodes using lattice model. In this case, the magnetic field is introduced by the Pierels substitution, while uniaxial strain by the direction dependence of hopping integrals. This allowed us to probe the Landau level and system spectrum which takes form of Hofstadter butterfly. We show that the renormalization of magnetic field, similar to this observed in the continuum model, emerges.</description>

      <title>Tunable Chern Insulators in Moir\'e-Distant and Moir\'e-Proximal Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum states arising from the interplay between electron correlations and topology. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e device with a twist angle of 1.02{\deg} and a moir\'e period of approximately 10.1 nm. In this device, we observe anomalous Hall effects and integer Chern insulators in both moir\'e-proximal and moir\'e-distant regimes. Specifically, in the moir\'e-distant regime, an integer Chern insulator with Chern number C = 1 emerges at moir\'e filling {\nu} = 1 under a moderate magnetic field. In the moir\'e-proximal regime, we identify a rich set of topological and correlated phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states with C = \pm 1 and trivial insulators, and they are highly sensitive to both the applied displacement field and magnetic field. Moreover, at {\nu} = 2 in the moir\'e-proximal regime, Chern insulators with C = \pm 1 has also been observed. Our results underscore the sensitivity of topological quantum states to the moir\'e potential strength and highlight the importance of twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states in rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Friedel Oscillations in a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas and Monolayer Graphene with a Non-Coulomb Impurity Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and in a monolayer graphene in the presence of a single impurity. The potential generated by the impurity is modeled using a non-Coulomb interaction ($\sim r^{-\eta}$). The charge carrier density deviation as a function of distance from the impurity is calculated within the linear response theory. Our results show that, in both a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and graphene, the phase of charge carrier density oscillations remains unaffected by the parameter $\eta$, which characterizes the non-Coulomb nature of the interaction, at large distances from the impurity. The parameter $\eta$ influences only the amplitude of the oscillations in this regime. The results for an impurity modeled by Coulomb-like potential ($\eta = 1$) are recovered in both cases.</description>

      <title>Quasi-BICs due to symmetry mismatch in architected elastic plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of quasi-bound modes in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in architected elastic plates based on a square lattice. The structure consists of topologically trivial and nontrivial lattices, forming an interface and maintaining C2 symmetry. Carefully engineered interface gives rise to center quasi-BICs. We show how the mismatch in symmetry between the Bloch modes of the lattice and the defect modes confine them at the defect center, resulting in quasi-BICs. Our analysis begins with a square lattice-based spring-mass system. Finite element simulations on an architected plate comprising of slender curved and straight beams to achieve the desired stiffness variation predict quasi-BICs analogous to those in the discrete model. These predictions are validated with Laser Doppler vibrometry based experiments, confirming the presence of a quasi-BIC in the structure. The concept of quasi-BICs arising from modal symmetry mismatch paves the way for achieving localized modes in elastic structures, with potential applications as resonators.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum geometric capacitance via photonic spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-dissipative quasistatic longitudinal optical response of insulators is characterized by an intrinsic geometric capacitance, determined by the ratio of the quantum metric to the energy gap, as recently stablished. We study the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in this low-frequency regime, induced by reflection from an atomically thin material serving as the interface between two dielectrics. As a function of the magnitude of this geometric capacitance, covering values typical of graphene-family systems and for incidence close to the Brewster angle, the calculated in-plane and transverse beam shifts become comparable to the wavelength and thus detectable. At sufficiently low frequencies, we derive linear and quadratic approximations that allow the geometric capacitance to be extracted from measurements of the beam displacements. We provide an upper bound for the beam shifts. The results suggest that THz PSHE might be a useful probe of the quantum geometric capacitance of two-dimensional insulators.</description>

      <title>Optimizing proximitized magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons for Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulator (MTI) nanoribbons proximitized by an $s$-wave superconductor (PNRs) are a potential platform for the practical realization of Majorana bound states (MBSs). As with all MBS platforms, disorder and device imperfections can be detrimental to the formation of robust and well-separated MBSs that are suitable for fusion and braiding experiments. Here, we identify the optimal conditions for obtaining a topological superconducting gap that is robust against disorder, with spatially separated stable MBSs in PNRs, and introduce a figure of merit that encompasses these conditions. Particular attention is given to the thin-film limit of MTIs, where the hybridization of the surface states cannot be neglected, and to the role of electron-hole asymmetry in the low-energy physics of the system. Based on our numerical results, we find that (1) MTI thin films that are normal (rather than quantum spin Hall) insulators for zero magnetization are favorable, (2) strong electron-hole asymmetry causes the stability and robustness of MBS to be very different for chemical potentials above or below the Dirac point, and (3) the magnetization strength should preferably be comparable to the hybridization or confinement energy of the surface states, whichever is largest.</description>

      <title>Topological Surface States of 3D Topological Insulator on Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological surface states (TSS) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a 3D topological insulator, epitaxially grown on twisted bilayer graphene (tBG). The moir\'e potential induced by tBG folds the TSS Dirac cone into the moir\'e Brillouin zone (MBZ), resulting in mini-gap openings, band flattening, and the potential emergence of secondary Dirac points. Using effective field theory, symmetry analysis, and higher-order perturbation theory, we analyze both commensurate and incommensurate twist angles, revealing significant band structure reconstruction in periodic systems and quasi-periodic effects in incommensurate ones. This work provides deep insights into the interplay between topological protection and moir\'e modulation, offering a pathway to engineer novel topological phases.</description>

      <title>Comparing the performance of direct and parametric drives for piezoelectric MEMS actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the response of piezoelectrically actuated nonlinear microelectromechanical devices (MEMS) to direct and to degenerate parametric drives. We describe the regime of degenerate parametric amplification in piezoelectric Duffing-type nonlinear MEMS devices using a single mode expansion, we then explore the existence of regions in parameter space where parametric excitation maybe advantageous compared to direct drive, which we label "parametric advantage". Analytical, experimental, and numerical verification demonstrates that parametric advantage can not exist if both pump and signal voltages are accounted for in the total voltage budget. This work determines non-dimensional scaling rules that can act as guidelines for selecting an optimal operating regime for degenerate parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry Protected Transport at Correlated Oxide Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protection is core to topological physics, yet its role in correlated oxides-typically non-topological-remains underexplored. This limit hampers the potential in engineering exotic quantum states by fusing TRS protection and the rich emergent phenomena in the oxide platform. Here, we report evidence of a TRS-protected subband at oxygen vacancy-free LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. This subband causes a low-field quantum oscillation with anomalous characters: exceptionally light electron mass, aperiodicity, and susceptibility to magnetic fields. All findings align with a Rashba model in which TRS-protected transport occurs along quasi-1D ferroelastic domain walls, which possess a Dirac band topology and a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling, two orders stronger than the 2D interface. Our results deepen the understanding of SrTiO3-based electron systems, unveiling an appealing new platform for quantum engineering.</description>

      <title>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging due to their momentum mismatch with photons and energy mismatch with plasmons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that graphene's ability to sustain a high bias and support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population enables near-infrared SPP generation in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of undoped monolayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and silver (Ag). We show that this mechanism requires neither optical gratings nor electron tunneling to produce non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission, which is uniform along the Ag-hBN interface and achieves an internal conversion efficiency of up to $10^{-3}$ with the Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects based on a multi-temperature kinetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.</description>

      <title>Hole-spin qubits in germanium beyond the single-particle regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense simulation activity on hole-spin qubits in Ge has focused so far on singly occupied quantum dots. Here, we theoretically investigate three-hole qubits in germanium and show that their performances compare well with those of their single-hole counterparts, both in strained and unstrained systems. In particular, enhancements of the gating times by two orders of magnitude are obtained in slightly elongated quantum dots. We show that, depending on the confinement anisotropy, such an enhancement is driven either by the occupation of excited spin-orbitals (Pauli principle), or by a Coulomb-induced charge rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Kondo-lattice behavior in the two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe$_2$GeTe$_3$ is a paradigmatic van der Waals magnet with the full microscopic picture of magnetic interactions still under debate. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 1.1 K to map out the low-energy physics on the surface. In agreement with previous works, we observe a spatially varying Fano lineshape that has been ascribed to a Kondo resonance. In addition, we identify a small gap of $\approx$ 5 meV width on top of the larger-energy Fano resonance. We suggest that this gap is the signature of a coherent Kondo lattice that has been proposed to originate from hybridization of a strongly dispersing and a flat band both derived from $d$ electrons of the Fe atoms in the lattice. Adding magnetic adatoms on the surface hardly influences the magnetic signatures of the substrate, indicating the robustness of the intralayer Kondo correlations against magnetic adsorbates.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology and skin modes in the continuum via parametric processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Hermitian, nonlocal parametric pairing processes can induce non-Hermitian topology and skin modes, offering a simple alternative to complex bath engineering. Our model, stabilized by local dissipation and operating in the continuum limit, reveals exceptional points that spawn a tilted diabolical line in the dispersion. Local dissipation prevents instabilities, while a bulk anomaly signals unscreened current response. Upon opening the boundaries, we observe a non-Hermitian skin effect with localized edge modes. Through bulk winding indices and non-Bloch theory, we establish a robust bulk-boundary correspondence, highlighting parametric drives as a scalable route to non-Hermitian topology in bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Robust electro-mechanical actuation in hydrogenated Xenes leading to reversible topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report from first principles, the possibility of reversible onset of topological insulator(TI) phase in heavier hydrogenated Xenes (Xane), namely, germanane and stanane, exclusively through in-plane electro-mechanical actuation. It is found possible to systematically induce robust uniaxial strain through non-uniform application of electric field in the plane of monolayers, as possible through application of in-homogeneous bias at gates of realizable length-scales embedded underneath. Electrically induced strain causes substantial lowering of band-gap across all Xanes, eventually evolving through weak followed by strong topologically insulating phases beyond a threshold degree of bias in-homogeneity in heavier Xanes, promisingly within the range of bias sustained by the monolayers. In case of nano-ribbons of these Xanes, bias applied in-homogeneously across width promises switchable emergence of TI phase over a fraction of width and topologically protected interface states localizable anywhere across the half-width of the ribbon. The demonstrated electro-mechanical actuation and the associated topological tuning of band-structure, thematically verified in gapped graphene based representative systems within the Kane-Mele model at half-filling, should be possible in the broader class of two dimensional covalent networks made of elements of the p-block.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity: Bilayer-MnBi2Te4/Fe(Se,Te) Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial Chern classes pose an obstruction to the existence of exponentially decaying Wannier functions which provide natural bases for spectral subspaces. For non-trivial Bloch bundles, we obtain decay rates of Wannier functions in dimensions $d=2,3$. For $d=2$, we construct Wannier functions with full asymptotics and optimal decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$ as conjectured by Thouless; for $d=3$, we construct Wannier functions with the uniform decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>2D van der Waals magnets: from fundamental physics to applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetism has played a central role in the long and rich history of modern condensed matter physics, with many foundational insights originating from theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) spin systems. The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets has revolutionized this area by providing real, atomically thin magnetic systems for experimental investigation. Since the first experimental reports of antiferromagnetic vdW insulators in 2016 - followed by studies on ferromagnetic vdW systems in 2017 - the field has witnessed rapid and expansive growth, with more than two dozen vdW magnetic materials now identified, including both ferro- and antiferromagnets. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the major scientific and technological developments in this rapidly evolving field. These include experimental realizations of various 2D spin Hamiltonians as well as unexpected phenomena such as magnetic excitons, Floquet-engineered states, and light-induced metastable magnetic phases. In parallel, 2D vdW magnets have shown significant promise in spintronics and related applications, offering a new platform for engineering quantum functionalities. We organize this review by tracing the historical development of the field, synthesizing key milestones, and highlighting its broader impact across condensed matter physics and materials science. We conclude with an Outlook section that outlines several promising directions for future research, aiming to chart a path forward in this vibrant and still rapidly growing area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Lagrangian of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon with constant background charge density is proposed for an effective field theory of conventional superconductivity. We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy and, for the critical couplings of the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field and the cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar field, these charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electron density modulation in monolayer $MoS_{2}$ along the phase transition of a relaxor ferroelectric substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric substrates is a powerful strategy to modulate their electronic and optical properties. However, the use of relaxor ferroelectrics for this purpose remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a reversible photoluminescence (PL) and charge density modulation of monolayer $MoS_{2}$ on a $Sr_{0.61}Ba_{0.39}Nb_{2}O_{6}$ (SBN) substrate, a prototypical relaxor ferroelectric. The smearing of the phase transition in SBN enables continuous tuning of $MoS_{2}$ electronic properties over a broad temperature range ($30-90{\deg}C$). A pronounced PL enhancement occurs as the substrate transitions from ferro-to-paraelectric phase due to the vanishing spontaneous polarization and the consequent change in charge balance at the $MoS_{2}-SBN$ interface. Moreover, thermal hysteresis in the electron density modulation is observed during heating and cooling cycles. These findings highlight the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics as reconfigurable platforms for electron doping and light-emission control in 2D materials, opening avenues for temperature-responsive optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Fast initialization of Bell states with Schr\"odinger cats in multi-mode systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</description>

      <title>Giant Gate Response of the Charge in an Electron-Lattice Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient electrical capacitive control is important for the next generation of ultra-low-power and ultra-fast electronics and energy-storage devices. Correlated electronic phases offer a powerful route to enhancing field-effect control beyond the limits of conventional capacitive gating. In such systems, modest gate voltages can couple to an order parameter, producing responses far larger than expected from the electrostatics of non-interacting carriers. It was demonstrated that electron-electron interactions, in which the exchange and correlation energies among electrons lower the chemical potential of an electron system as the electron density increases, can significantly increase the effective capacitance over its geometric capacitance value. Here, we show that the electron-lattice or electron-phonon correlations in charge density wave (CDW) condensate can lead to a giant gate response with the corresponding capacitance enhancement. This unusual phenomenon is demonstrated in the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material, where the gate-induced change in CDW charge density exceeds predictions based on geometrical gate capacitance by one to two orders of magnitude. This "giant gating" effect arises from the coupling of the electric field to the CDW electron-lattice condensate, demonstrating a mechanism for massively amplifying gate response via collective electronic behavior. We quantify the effect by determining the quantum capacitance of the CDW charge and by constructing a band diagram for the gated CDW device. The obtained results can lead to an alternative strategy for continuing the downscaling of the transistor feature size in electronic technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of the shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis of the crystal: a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect in Topological Amorphous Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have been theoretically predicted to become topological metals with anomalous Hall conductivity in amorphous systems. However, measuring the anomalous Hall conductivity in realistic materials, particularly those with multiple pairs of Weyl points, is a significant challenge. If a system respects time-reversal symmetry, then the anomalous Hall conductivity even vanishes. As such, it remains an open question how to probe the Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, under magnetic fields, a topological metal slab in amorphous systems exhibits three-dimensional quantum Hall effect, even in time-reversal invariant systems, thereby providing a feasible approach to exploring Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. We unveil the topological origin of the quantized Hall conductance by calculating the Bott index. The index is carried by broadened Landau levels with bulk states spatially localized except at critical transition energies.The topological property also results in edge states localized at distinct hinges on two opposite surfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-linear photoconductivity of strongly driven graphene</title>

Abstract: We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis and experimental control of transformations of domain walls in magnetic cylindrical nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures by defining a topological index in both two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism, both volume and surface topological numbers must be considered, requiring the identification of a proper global topological invariant to support categorization. Here we consider domain walls in cylindrical nanowires as an excellent playground for 3D nanomagnetic systems, excited by a charge current, that generates an OErsted field. We first provide experimental evidence of previously unreported domain-wall transformations of topology occurring at the nanosecond timescale. We investigate these transformations with micromagnetic simulations, tracking both bulk and surface topological signatures.We demonstrate a topological invariant combining both signatures, while the topological charge varies from bulk to surface during the dynamics. The experimental change of topology is reproduced when the pulse duration matches the timescale of the internal transformations of the wall, and the current is switched off before the transformation is complete. We expect that the topological categorization and dynamical exploitation apply to any 3D nanomagnetic system.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ballistic graphene Andreev interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Tunable atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We demonstrate the atomic reconstruction between the two competing moir\'e superlattices strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e band insulator state, characterized by measured strong nonlocal valley Hall effect that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-plane carrier distribution. Our study sheds light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted multilayer systems, by systematically investigating transport signatures of moir\'e Berry curvature and its enhancement from moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice reconstruction. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach toward engineering the band structure and its topology for a quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>First-principles derived force field for h-BN monolayer nanostructures: Applications to sheets, nanotubes and nanotori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. By combining a continuum model for bent hollow beams with the definition of bending rigidity, we validate the model predictions against an analytical expression for the bending rigidity of large-diameter hBN nanotubes, expressed as a function of their radius and the in-plane Young modulus.</description>

      <title>Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable polarized state of a two-level atomic system with a right-circularly polarized electric dipole transition in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</description>

Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points are visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.</description>

      <title>Surface-Dominated Quantum Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport in the Layered Antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the N\'eel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the piano key size and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum-Dependent Spectral Shift in Chiral Vacuum Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended $XY$ model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor $XY$ model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Electric Control of Polarity in Spin-Orbit Josephson Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of spin-orbit coupling in a Josephson diode has not been elucidated due to its interplay with the complexity of Josephson devices. Here, we systematically control local electric fields in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions under in-plane magnetic fields and observe a polarity reversal of the Josephson diode. We interpret this polarity reversal as an effect of field-tunable spin-orbit coupling on nonreciprocal Josephson currents. A theoretical model, accounting for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings in a planar Josephson junction containing many transverse subbands, aligns with the observed polarity reversal and its dependence on magnetic field. Our finding addresses spin-orbit control in a Josephson diode, enabling manipulation of Josephson harmonics.</description>

      <title>Meissner effect in non-Hermitian superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type, i.e., with an electron-electron interaction leading to the mean field description in a Cooper channel, via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including negative superfluid stiffness giving paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters. Negative superfluid stiffness indicates instability of this collective state.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <title>Engineering Dark Spin-Free Diamond Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>
