      <title>Fast Query of Biharmonic Distance in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{biharmonic distance} (BD) is a fundamental metric that measures the distance of two nodes in a graph. It has found applications in network coherence, machine learning, and computational graphics, among others. In spite of BD's importance, efficient algorithms for the exact computation or approximation of this metric on large graphs remain notably absent. In this work, we provide several algorithms to estimate BD, building on a novel formulation of this metric. These algorithms enjoy locality property (that is, they only read a small portion of the input graph) and at the same time possess provable performance guarantees. In particular, our main algorithms approximate the BD between any node pair with an arbitrarily small additive error $\eps$ in time $O(\frac{1}{\eps^2}\text{poly}(\log\frac{n}{\eps} ))$. Furthermore, we perform an extensive empirical study on several benchmark networks, validating the performance and accuracy of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Networks That Preserve Edge Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since true communities within real-world networks are rarely known, synthetic networks with planted ground truths are valuable for evaluating the performance of community detection methods. Of the synthetic network generation tools available, Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) produce networks with ground truth clusters that well approximate input parameters from real-world networks and clusterings. However, we show that SBMs can produce disconnected ground truth clusters, even when given parameters from clusterings where all clusters are connected. Here we describe the REalistic Cluster Connectivity Simulator (RECCS), a technique that modifies an SBM synthetic network to improve the fit to a given clustered real-world network with respect to edge connectivity within clusters, while maintaining the good fit with respect to other network and cluster statistics. Using real-world networks up to 13.9 million nodes in size, we show that RECCS, applied to stochastic block models, results in synthetic networks that have a better fit to cluster edge connectivity than unmodified SBMs, while providing roughly the same quality fit for other network and clustering parameters as unmodified SBMs.</description>

      <title>ORBITAAL: A Temporal Graph Dataset of Bitcoin Entity-Entity Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Bitcoin (BTC) transactions is a matter of interest for both economic and network science fields. Although this cryptocurrency is based on a decentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw blockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol specificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset, we present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph formalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to January 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity transaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is given in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This dataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and associated public addresses.</description>

      <title>Competing Social Contagions with Opinion Dependent Infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation (maliciously spread false information) in online social networks has become an important problem in today's society. Disinformation's spread is facilitated by the fact that individuals often accept false information based on cognitive biases which predispose them to believe information that they have heard repeatedly or that aligns with their beliefs. Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the transient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the revival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread opinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to the eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals can possess a collective opinion that may differ from the opinions of the individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show, both numerically and via our mean-field description, that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>HRGraph: Leveraging LLMs for HR Data Knowledge Graphs with Information Propagation-based Job Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serving as semantic networks, prove highly effective in managing complex interconnected data in different domains, by offering a unified, contextualized, and structured representation with flexibility that allows for easy adaptation to evolving knowledge. Processing complex Human Resources (HR) data, KGs can help in different HR functions like recruitment, job matching, identifying learning gaps, and enhancing employee retention. Despite their potential, limited efforts have been made to implement practical HR knowledge graphs. This study addresses this gap by presenting a framework for effectively developing HR knowledge graphs from documents using Large Language Models. The resulting KG can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including job matching, identifying employee skill gaps, and many more. In this work, we showcase instances where HR KGs prove instrumental in precise job matching, yielding advantages for both employers and employees. Empirical evidence from experiments with information propagation in KGs and Graph Neural Nets, along with case studies underscores the effectiveness of KGs in tasks such as job and employee recommendations and job area classification.

      <title>Smart Home Cyber Insurance Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our homes are increasingly employing various kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, leading to the notion of smart homes. While this trend brings convenience to our daily life, it also introduces cyber risks. To mitigate such risks, the demand for smart home cyber insurance has been growing rapidly. However, there are no studies on analyzing the competency of smart home cyber insurance policies offered by cyber insurance vendors (i.e., insurers), where `competency' means the insurer is profitable and smart home owners are not overly charged with premiums and/or deductibles. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for pricing smart home cyber insurance, which can be adopted by insurers in practice. Our case studies show, among other things, that insurers are over charging smart home owners in terms of premiums and deductibles.</description>

      <title>Finding the Center and Centroid of a Graph with Multiple Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a "fair" meeting place when S people want to get together. Specifically, we will consider the cases where a "fair" meeting place is defined to be either 1) a node on a graph that minimizes the maximum time/distance to each person or 2) a node on a graph that minimizes the sum of times/distances to each of the sources. In graph theory, these nodes are denoted as the center and centroid of a graph respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for finding the center and centroid of a graph by using a multiple source alternating Dijkstra's Algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a stopping condition that significantly saves on time complexity without compromising the accuracy of the solution. The results of this paper are a low complexity algorithm that is optimal in computing the center of S sources among N nodes and a low complexity algorithm that is close to optimal for computing the centroid of S sources among N nodes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Luxury Vehicle Dealership Networks: A Graph Neural Network Approach to Site Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize dealership network planning for a luxury car manufacturer in the U.S. By conducting a comprehensive literature review on dealership location determinants, the study identifies 65 county-level explanatory variables, augmented by two additional measures of regional interconnectedness derived from social and mobility data. An ablation study involving 34 variable combinations and ten state-of-the-art GNN operators reveals key insights into the predictive power of various variables, particularly highlighting the significance of competition, demographic factors, and mobility patterns in influencing dealership location decisions. The analysis pinpoints seven specific counties as promising targets for network expansion. This research not only illustrates the effectiveness of GNNs in solving complex geospatial decision-making problems but also provides actionable recommendations and valuable methodological insights for industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Normal Estimation of Local Latent Network Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network data, commonly used throughout the physical, social, and biological sciences, consist of nodes (individuals) and the edges (interactions) between them. One way to represent network data's complex, high-dimensional structure is to embed the graph into a low-dimensional geometric space. The curvature of this space, in particular, provides insights about the structure in the graph, such as the propensity to form triangles or present tree-like structures. We derive an estimating function for curvature based on triangle side lengths and the length of the midpoint of a side to the opposing corner. We construct an estimator where the only input is a distance matrix and also establish asymptotic normality. We next introduce a novel latent distance matrix estimator for networks and an efficient algorithm to compute the estimate via solving iterative quadratic programs. We apply this method to the Los Alamos National Laboratory Unified Network and Host dataset and show how curvature estimates can be used to detect a red-team attack faster than naive methods, as well as discover non-constant latent curvature in co-authorship networks in physics. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/SteveJWR/netcurve, and the methods are implemented in the R package https://github.com/SteveJWR/lolaR.</description>

      <title>MetaGAD: Meta Representation Adaptation for Few-Shot Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection has long been an important problem in various domains pertaining to information security such as financial fraud, social spam and network intrusion. The majority of existing methods are performed in an unsupervised manner, as labeled anomalies in a large scale are often too expensive to acquire. However, the identified anomalies may turn out to be uninteresting data instances due to the lack of prior knowledge. In real-world scenarios, it is often feasible to obtain limited labeled anomalies, which have great potential to advance graph anomaly detection. However, the work exploring limited labeled anomalies and a large amount of unlabeled nodes in graphs to detect anomalies is relatively limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study an important problem of few-shot graph anomaly detection. Nonetheless, it is challenging to fully leverage the information of few-shot anomalous nodes due to the irregularity of anomalies and the overfitting issue in the few-shot learning. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework, MetaGAD, that learns to adapt the knowledge from self-supervised learning to few-shot supervised learning for graph anomaly detection. In specific, we formulate the problem as a bi-level optimization, ensuring MetaGAD converging to minimizing the validation loss, thus enhancing the generalization capacity. The comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets with synthetic anomalies and "organic" anomalies (available in the datasets) demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaGAD in detecting anomalies with few-shot anomalies. The code is available at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/MetaGAD.</description>

      <title>Big Tech influence over AI research revisited: memetic analysis of attribution of ideas to affiliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exists a growing discourse around the domination of Big Tech on the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) research, yet our comprehension of this phenomenon remains cursory. This paper aims to broaden and deepen our understanding of Big Tech's reach and power within AI research. It highlights the dominance not merely in terms of sheer publication volume but rather in the propagation of new ideas or memes. Current studies often oversimplify the concept of influence to the share of affiliations in academic papers, typically sourced from limited databases such as arXiv or specific academic conferences.
  The main goal of this paper is to unravel the specific nuances of such influence, determining which AI ideas are predominantly driven by Big Tech entities. By employing network and memetic analysis on AI-oriented paper abstracts and their citation network, we are able to grasp a deeper insight into this phenomenon. By utilizing two databases: OpenAlex and S2ORC, we are able to perform such analysis on a much bigger scale than previous attempts.
  Our findings suggest that while Big Tech-affiliated papers are disproportionately more cited in some areas, the most cited papers are those affiliated with both Big Tech and Academia. Focusing on the most contagious memes, their attribution to specific affiliation groups (Big Tech, Academia, mixed affiliation) seems equally distributed between those three groups. This suggests that the notion of Big Tech domination over AI research is oversimplified in the discourse.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns with a Heightened Citation Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date. In our experiment, LLMs are tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. The results hold for both GPT-4, and the more capable models GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 where the papers are part of the training data. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of LLM's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases, such as the Matthew effect, and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination.</description>

      <title>"Sharing, Not Showing Off": How BeReal Approaches Authentic Self-Presentation on Social Media Through Its Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the pressures created by social media, such as heightened self-consciousness and the need for extensive self-presentation. In this study, we investigate how BeReal, a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic.
