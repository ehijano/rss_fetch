      <title>Hard-Thresholding Meets Evolution Strategies in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution Strategies (ES) have emerged as a competitive alternative for model-free reinforcement learning, showcasing exemplary performance in tasks like Mujoco and Atari. Notably, they shine in scenarios with imperfect reward functions, making them invaluable for real-world applications where dense reward signals may be elusive. Yet, an inherent assumption in ES, that all input features are task-relevant, poses challenges, especially when confronted with irrelevant features common in real-world problems. This work scrutinizes this limitation, particularly focusing on the Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) variant. We propose NESHT, a novel approach that integrates Hard-Thresholding (HT) with NES to champion sparsity, ensuring only pertinent features are employed. Backed by rigorous analysis and empirical tests, NESHT demonstrates its promise in mitigating the pitfalls of irrelevant features and shines in complex decision-making problems like noisy Mujoco and Atari tasks.</description>

      <title>Early years of Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis focusing on Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms (BRKGA). BRKGA is a metaheuristic framework that uses random-key-based chromosomes with biased, uniform, and elitist mating strategies alongside a genetic algorithm. This review encompasses around~250 papers, covering a diverse array of applications ranging from classical combinatorial optimization problems to real-world industrial scenarios, and even non-traditional applications like hyperparameter tuning in machine learning and scenario generation for two-stage problems. In summary, this study offers a comprehensive examination of the BRKGA metaheuristic and its various applications, shedding light on key areas for future research.</description>

      <title>TinySeg: Model Optimizing Framework for Image Segmentation on Tiny Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is one of the major computer vision tasks, which is applicable in a variety of domains, such as autonomous navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle. However, image segmentation cannot easily materialize on tiny embedded systems because image segmentation models generally have high peak memory usage due to their architectural characteristics. This work finds that image segmentation models unnecessarily require large memory space with an existing tiny machine learning framework. That is, the existing framework cannot effectively manage the memory space for the image segmentation models.
  This work proposes TinySeg, a new model optimizing framework that enables memory-efficient image segmentation for tiny embedded systems. TinySeg analyzes the lifetimes of tensors in the target model and identifies long-living tensors. Then, TinySeg optimizes the memory usage of the target model mainly with two methods: (i) tensor spilling into local or remote storage and (ii) fused fetching of spilled tensors. This work implements TinySeg on top of the existing tiny machine learning framework and demonstrates that TinySeg can reduce the peak memory usage of an image segmentation model by 39.3% for tiny embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Spiking Neural Network Simulation with FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using OpenCL-based high-level synthesis, we create a number of spiking neural network (SNN) simulators for the Potjans-Diesmann cortical microcircuit for a high-end Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our best simulators simulate the circuit 25\% faster than real-time, require less than 21 nJ per synaptic event, and are bottle-necked by the device's on-chip memory. Speed-wise they compare favorably to the state-of-the-art GPU-based simulators and their energy usage is lower than any other published result. This result is the first for simulating the circuit on a single hardware accelerator. We also extensively analyze the techniques and algorithms we implement our simulators with, many of which can be realized on other types of hardware. Thus, this article is of interest to any researcher or practitioner interested in efficient SNN simulation, whether they target FPGAs or not.</description>

      <title>Learning from Evolution: Improving Collective Decision-Making Mechanisms using Insights from Evolutionary Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective decision-making enables multi-robot systems to act autonomously in real-world environments. Existing collective decision-making mechanisms suffer from the so-called speed versus accuracy trade-off or rely on high complexity, e.g., by including global communication. Recent work has shown that more efficient collective decision-making mechanisms based on artificial neural networks can be generated using methods from evolutionary computation. A major drawback of these decision-making neural networks is their limited interpretability. Analyzing evolved decision-making mechanisms can help us improve the efficiency of hand-coded decision-making mechanisms while maintaining a higher interpretability. In this paper, we analyze evolved collective decision-making mechanisms in detail and hand-code two new decision-making mechanisms based on the insights gained. In benchmark experiments, we show that the newly implemented collective decision-making mechanisms are more efficient than the state-of-the-art collective decision-making mechanisms voter model and majority rule.</description>

      <title>Proven Runtime Guarantees for How the MOEA/D Computes the Pareto Front From the Subproblem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) does not directly optimize a given multi-objective function $f$, but instead optimizes $N + 1$ single-objective subproblems of $f$ in a co-evolutionary manner. It maintains an archive of all non-dominated solutions found and outputs it as approximation to the Pareto front. Once the MOEA/D found all optima of the subproblems (the $g$-optima), it may still miss Pareto optima of $f$. The algorithm is then tasked to find the remaining Pareto optima directly by mutating the $g$-optima.
  In this work, we analyze for the first time how the MOEA/D with only standard mutation operators computes the whole Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark when the $g$-optima are a strict subset of the Pareto front. For standard bit mutation, we prove an expected runtime of $O(n N \log n + n^{n/(2N)} N \log n)$ function evaluations. Especially for the second, more interesting phase when the algorithm start with all $g$-optima, we prove an $\Omega(n^{(1/2)(n/N + 1)} \sqrt{N} 2^{-n/N})$ expected runtime. This runtime is super-polynomial if $N = o(n)$, since this leaves large gaps between the $g$-optima, which require costly mutations to cover.
  For power-law mutation with exponent $\beta \in (1, 2)$, we prove an expected runtime of $O\left(n N \log n + n^{\beta} \log n\right)$ function evaluations. The $O\left(n^{\beta} \log n\right)$ term stems from the second phase of starting with all $g$-optima, and it is independent of the number of subproblems $N$. This leads to a huge speedup compared to the lower bound for standard bit mutation. In general, our overall bound for power-law suggests that the MOEA/D performs best for $N = O(n^{\beta - 1})$, resulting in an $O(n^\beta \log n)$ bound. In contrast to standard bit mutation, smaller values of $N$ are better for power-law mutation, as it is capable of easily creating missing solutions.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning in Parameterized Action Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.04143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that deep neural networks are capable of approximating both value functions and policies in reinforcement learning domains featuring continuous state and action spaces. However, to the best of our knowledge no previous work has succeeded at using deep neural networks in structured (parameterized) continuous action spaces. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on learning within the domain of simulated RoboCup soccer, which features a small set of discrete action types, each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. The best learned agent can score goals more reliably than the 2012 RoboCup champion agent. As such, this paper represents a successful extension of deep reinforcement learning to the class of parameterized action space MDPs.</description>

      <title>From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.</description>

      <title>What Planning Problems Can A Relational Neural Network Solve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned policies are generally understood to be "feed-forward" circuits, in the form of neural networks that map from the current state and the goal specification to the next action to take. However, under what circumstances such a policy can be learned and how efficient the policy will be are not well understood. In this paper, we present a circuit complexity analysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks and transformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawing connections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that there are three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth of circuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planning horizon, providing constructive proofs. We also illustrate the utility of this analysis for designing neural networks for policy learning.</description>

      <title>Visual Enumeration is Challenging for Large-scale Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans can readily judge the number of objects in a visual scene, even without counting, and such a skill has been documented in many animal species and babies prior to language development and formal schooling. Numerical judgments are error-free for small sets, while for larger collections responses become approximate, with variability increasing proportionally to the target number. This response pattern is observed for items of all kinds, despite variation in object features (such as color or shape), suggesting that our visual number sense relies on abstract representations of numerosity. Here, we investigate whether large-scale generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have a human-like number sense, which should allow them to reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items in the 1-10 range. Surprisingly, most of the foundation models considered have a poor number sense: They make striking errors even with small numbers, the response variability does not increase in a systematic way, and the pattern of errors depends on object category. Only the most recent proprietary systems exhibit signatures of a visual number sense. Our findings demonstrate that having an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for foundation models, which in turn might be detrimental to the perceptual grounding of numeracy that in humans is crucial for mathematical learning.</description>
