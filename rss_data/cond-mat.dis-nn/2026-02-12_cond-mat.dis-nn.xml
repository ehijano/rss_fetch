      <title>Fragile $\mathit{vs}$ robust Multiple Equilibria phases in generalized Lotka-Volterra model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Multiple Equilibria phase of generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics with random, non-reciprocal interactions. We compute the topological complexity of equilibria, which quantifies how rapidly the number of equilibria of the dynamical equations grows with the total number of species. We perform the calculation for arbitrary degree of non-reciprocity in the interactions, distinguishing between configurations that are dynamically stable to invasions by species absent from the equilibrium, and those that are not. We characterize the properties of typical (i.e., most numerous) equilibria at a given diversity, including their average abundance, mutual similarity, and internal stability. This analysis reveals the existence of two distinct ME phases, which differ in how internally stable equilibria behave under invasions by absent species. We discuss the implications of this finding for the system's dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>On generating Special Quasirandom Structures: Optimization for the DFT computational efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our novel evolutionary algorithm for generating Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) designed to optimize the computational efficiency of Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Operating on the premise that symmetry proxies non-randomness, we rigorously filter out 1.P1 candidate structures prior to evaluating correlation functions. Our extinction-based workflow includes the seeding, filtration, evaluation, extinction, and repopulation phases to produce efficient supercells with maximal local environmental distinctness. We compare our results against those generated by established software packages, on the example of the W\textsubscript{70}Cr\textsubscript{30} alloy. Although standard tools achieve (marginally) lower correlation errors, our best-performing structures require approximately five times fewer unique displacements for phonon calculations. This approach sacrifices negligible quantitative disorder accuracy to significantly reduce the computational cost of modeling thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum Field Theory from Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.</description>

      <title>Excited String States and D-branes from Infinite Width Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore recent proposal to represent worldsheet string path integrals by integrating over parameters of a wide random-feature neural network whose output is identified with the embedding field $X^\mu$. In this paper we extend it focusing on scattering with excited states insertions and for worldsheets with boundaries introducing fixed-feature Gaussian normal-ordering prescription for derivative composites (removing the neural contact term at finite width), and propose realization of mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions interpreted as a neural D$p$-brane. As concrete outputs, we derive the sphere four-point integrand with a single $(1,1)$ insertion and the disk four-tachyon amplitude on a D$p$-brane, recovering the expected derivative prefactors, boundary exponents, and momentum-conservation limits after renormalization.</description>

      <title>A solvable high-dimensional model where nonlinear autoencoders learn structure invisible to PCA while test loss misaligns with generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets contain hidden structure that cannot be detected by simple linear correlations between input features. For example, latent factors may influence the data in a coordinated way, even though their effect is invisible to covariance-based methods such as PCA. In practice, nonlinear neural networks often succeed in extracting such hidden structure in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher.</description>

      <title>Dirac mode localization in QCD near the crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Deterministic roughening in the dc-driven precessional regime of domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate description, we show that flat chiral domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a characteristic scale. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal spectral stability diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, which predicts the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime, large domain walls with bands of unstable modes develop spatiotemporal chaos, intricate Bloch-line dynamics, and deterministic roughening. At a critical field, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase with universal features. Our results provide a framework for addressing domain-wall dynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations and quenched disorder by disentangling their effects from intrinsic deterministic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Continuum model for the terahertz dielectric response of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson peak dynamics in glasses produce a robust crossover in the terahertz (THz) dielectric response that standard Debye or Lorentz models do not capture. We develop a continuum description of this THz response, coupling an infrared-effective charge fluctuation spectrum to a frequency-dependent shear modulus, and apply it to glycerol glass. The model reproduces the measured complex dielectric function and the nearly linear infrared light-vibration coupling around the boson peak, and highlights the dominant role of transverse shear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>
