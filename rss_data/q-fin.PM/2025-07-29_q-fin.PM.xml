      <title>Optimal mean-variance portfolio selection under regime-switching-induced stock price shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection problems with jumps in a regime-switching financial model. The novelty of our approach lies in allowing not only the market parameters -- such as the interest rate, appreciation rate, volatility, and jump intensity -- to depend on the market regime, but also in permitting stock prices to experience jumps when the market regime switches, in addition to the usual micro-level jumps. This modeling choice is motivated by empirical observations that stock prices often exhibit sharp declines when the market shifts from a ``bullish'' to a ``bearish'' regime, and vice versa. By employing the completion-of-squares technique, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy and the efficient frontier, both of which are characterized by three systems of multi-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Among these, two systems are linear, while the first one is an $\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, and highly nonlinear Riccati equation. In the absence of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks, these systems reduce to simple linear ODEs. Thus, the introduction of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks adds significant complexity and challenges to our model. Additionally, we explore the MV problem under a no-shorting constraint. In this case, the corresponding Riccati equation becomes a $2\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, nonlinear ODE, for which we establish solvability. The solution is then used to explicitly express the optimal portfolio and the efficient frontier.</description>

      <title>Dependency Network-Based Portfolio Design with Forecasting and VaR Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel portfolio optimization framework that integrates statistical social network analysis with time series forecasting and risk management. Using daily stock data from the S&amp;P 500 (2020-2024), we construct dependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based network. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to quantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty information we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By applying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core inter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A dynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital allocated based on Value at Risk (VaR). To refine stock selection, we incorporate forecasts from ARIMA and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) models. Trading simulations over a one-year period demonstrate that the MST-based strategies outperform a buy-and-hold benchmark, with the tuned NNAR-enhanced strategy achieving a 63.74% return versus 18.00% for the benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of combining network structures, predictive modeling, and risk metrics to improve adaptive financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Building crypto portfolios with agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to 2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility. Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable, auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.</description>

      <title>Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.</description>

      <title>Technical Indicator Networks (TINs): An Interpretable Neural Architecture Modernizing Classic al Technical Analysis for Adaptive Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed and interpretable weights. It is shown that nearly all such indicators, such as moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning from Expert Factors: Trajectory-level Reward Shaping for Formulaic Alpha Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Correlation Models for the Cross-Section of Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note discusses some of the aspects of a model for the covariance of equity returns based on a simple "isotropic" structure in which all pairwise correlations are taken to be the same value. The effect of the structure on feasible values for the common correlation of returns and on the "effective degrees of freedom" within the equity cross-section are discussed, as well as the impact of this constraint on the asymptotic Normality of portfolio returns. An eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is presented and used to partition variance into that from a common "market" factor and "non-diversifiable" idiosyncratic risk. A empirical analysis of the recent history of the returns of S&amp;P 500 Index members is presented and compared to the expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis supports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence in support of linear factor models. Analysis of portfolio selection under isotropic correlation is presented using mean-variance optimization for both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic cases. Portfolio selection for negative exponential utility maximizers is also discussed for the general case of distributions of returns with elliptical symmetry. The fact that idiosyncratic risk may not be removed by diversification in a model that the data supports undermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T. If the cross-section of equity returns is more accurately described by this structure then an inevitable consequence is that picking stocks is not a "pointless" activity, as the returns to residual risk would be non-zero.</description>
