      <title>Regularization for Covariance Parameterization of Direct Data-Driven LQR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the benchmark of data-driven control methods, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem has gained significant attention. A growing trend is direct LQR design, which finds the optimal LQR gain directly from raw data and bypassing system identification. To achieve this, our previous work develops a direct LQR formulation parameterized by sample covariance. In this paper, we propose a regularization method for the covariance-parameterized LQR. We show that the regularizer accounts for the uncertainty in both the steady-state covariance matrix corresponding to closed-loop stability, and the LQR cost function corresponding to averaged control performance. With a positive or negative coefficient, the regularizer can be interpreted as promoting either exploitation or exploration, which are well-known trade-offs in reinforcement learning. In simulations, we observe that our covariance-parameterized LQR with regularization can significantly outperform the certainty-equivalence LQR in terms of both the optimality gap and the robust closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Deep Koopman Network (MDK-Net) for Vehicle Control in Frenet Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly nonlinear dynamics of vehicles present a major challenge for the practical implementation of optimal and Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches in path planning and following. Koopman operator theory offers a global linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, making it a promising framework for optimization-based vehicle control. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based Koopman modeling approach that employs deep neural networks to capture the full vehicle dynamics-from pedal and steering inputs to chassis states-within a curvilinear Frenet frame. The superior accuracy of the Koopman model compared to identified linear models is shown for a double lane change maneuver. Furthermore, it is shown that an MPC controller deploying the Koopman model provides significantly improved performance while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to a linear MPC.</description>

      <title>The Untapped Potential of Smart Charging: How EV Owners Can Save Money and Reduce Emissions Without Behavioral Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to US emissions and the second largest globally. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to represent half of global car sales by 2035, emerging as a pivotal solution to reduce emissions and enhance grid flexibility. The electrification of buildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity demand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV charging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity costs. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive, this study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged in their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed charging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV owners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility tariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during optimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an opportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through smarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or sacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within existing plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can save an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of charging their EV by as much as 28%.</description>

      <title>On the Data-Driven Modeling of Price-Responsive Flexible Loads: Formulation and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flexible loads in power systems, such as interruptible and transferable loads, are critical flexibility resources for mitigating power imbalances. Despite their potential, accurate modeling of these loads is a challenging work and has not received enough attention, limiting their integration into operational frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper develops a data-driven identification theory and algorithm for price-responsive flexible loads (PRFLs). First, we introduce PRFL models that capture both static and dynamic decision mechanisms governing their response to electricity price variations. Second, We develop a data-driven identification framework that explicitly incorporates forecast and measurement errors. Particularly, we give a theoretical analysis to quantify the statistical impact of such noise on parameter estimation. Third, leveraging the bilevel structure of the identification problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm that features the scalability to large sample sizes and the ability to offer posterior differentiability certificates as byproducts. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems via Probabilistic Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of safety verification for nonlinear stochastic systems, specifically the task of certifying that system trajectories remain within a safe set with high probability. To tackle this challenge, we adopt a set-erosion strategy, which decouples the effects of stochastic disturbances from deterministic dynamics. This approach converts the stochastic safety verification problem on a safe set into a deterministic safety verification problem on an eroded subset of the safe set. The success of this strategy hinges on the depth of erosion, which is determined by a probabilistic tube that bounds the deviation of stochastic trajectories from their corresponding deterministic trajectories. Our main contribution is the establishment of a tight bound for the probabilistic tube of nonlinear stochastic systems. To obtain a probabilistic bound for stochastic trajectories, we adopt a martingale-based approach. The core innovation lies in the design of a novel energy function associated with the averaged moment generating function, which forms an affine martingale, a generalization of the traditional c-martingale. Using this energy function, we derive a precise bound for the probabilistic tube. Furthermore, we enhance this bound by incorporating the union-bound inequality for strictly contractive dynamics. By integrating the derived probabilistic tubes into the set-erosion strategy, we demonstrate that the safety verification problem for nonlinear stochastic systems can be reduced to a deterministic safety verification problem. Our theoretical results are validated through applications in reachability-based safety verification and safe controller synthesis, accompanied by several numerical examples that illustrate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Safety Enhanced Trajectory Planning and Control Framework for Quadrotor Flight in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quadrotors, achieving safe and autonomous flight in complex environments with wind disturbances and dynamic obstacles still faces significant challenges. Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.</description>

      <title>Composite Nonlinear Trajectory Tracking Control of Co-Driving Vehicles Using Self-Triggered Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control method using self-triggered (ST) adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm in a human-machine shared steering framework. For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Power Optimization for Max-Min Fairness in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Design for Repeated Decision-Making under Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model to characterize individual tendencies in repeated decision-making scenarios, with the goal of designing model-based control strategies that promote virtuous choices amidst social and external influences. Our approach builds on the classical Friedkin and Johnsen model of social influence, extending it to include random factors (e.g., inherent variability in individual needs) and controllable external inputs. We explicitly account for the temporal separation between two processes that shape opinion dynamics: individual decision-making and social imitation. While individual decisions occur at regular, frequent intervals, the influence of social imitation unfolds over longer periods. The inclusion of random factors naturally leads to dynamics that do not converge in the classical sense. However, under specific conditions, we prove that opinions exhibit ergodic behavior. Building on this result, we propose a constrained asymptotic optimal control problem designed to foster, on average, social acceptance of a target action within a network. To address the transient dynamics of opinions, we reformulate this problem within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. Simulations highlight the significance of accounting for these transient effects in steering individuals toward virtuous choices while managing policy costs.</description>

      <title>A modeling framework to support the electrification of private transport in African cities: a case study of Addis Ababa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of road transport, as the predominant mode of transportation in Africa, represents a great opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on costly fuel imports. However, it introduces major challenges for local energy infrastructures, including the deployment of charging stations and the impact on often fragile electricity grids. Despite its importance, research on electric mobility planning in Africa remains limited, while existing planning tools rely on detailed local mobility data that is often unavailable, especially for privately owned passenger vehicles. In this study, we introduce a novel framework designed to support private vehicle electrification in data-scarce regions and apply it to Addis Ababa, simulating the mobility patterns and charging needs of 100,000 electric vehicles. Our analysis indicate that these vehicles generate a daily charging demand of approximately 350 MWh and emphasize the significant influence of the charging location on the spatial and temporal distribution of this demand. Notably, charging at public places can help smooth the charging demand throughout the day, mitigating peak charging loads on the electricity grid. We also estimate charging station requirements, finding that workplace charging requires approximately one charging point per three electric vehicles, while public charging requires only one per thirty. Finally, we demonstrate that photovoltaic energy can cover a substantial share of the charging needs, emphasizing the potential for renewable energy integration. This study lays the groundwork for electric mobility planning in Addis Ababa while offering a transferable framework for other African cities.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical Mechanical Jitter in a THz Communication Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of mechanical vibration (jitter) is an increasingly important parameter for next-generation, long-distance wireless communication links and the channel models used for their engineering. Existing investigations of jitter effects on the terahertz (THz) backhaul channel are theoretical and derived primarily from free space optical models. These lack an empirical and validated treatment of the true statistical nature of antenna motion. We present novel experimental data which reveals that the statistical nature of mechanical jitter in 6G links is more complex than previously assumed. An unexpected multimodal distribution is discovered, which cannot be fit with the commonly cited model. These results compel the refinement of THz channel models under jitter and the resulting system performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Robust time series generation via Schr\"odinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</description>

      <title>Determinantal Learning for Subset Selection in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subset selection is central to many wireless communication problems, including link scheduling, power allocation, and spectrum management. However, these problems are often NP-complete, because of which heuristic algorithms applied to solve these problems struggle with scalability in large-scale settings. To address this, we propose a determinantal point process-based learning (DPPL) framework for efficiently solving general subset selection problems in massive networks. The key idea is to model the optimal subset as a realization of a determinantal point process (DPP), which balances the trade-off between quality (signal strength) and similarity (mutual interference) by enforcing negative correlation in the selection of {\em similar} links (those that create significant mutual interference). However, conventional methods for constructing similarity matrices in DPP impose decomposability and symmetry constraints that often do not hold in practice. To overcome this, we introduce a new method based on the Gershgorin Circle Theorem for constructing valid similarity matrices. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two canonical wireless network settings: an ad hoc network in 2D and a cellular network serving drones in 3D. Simulation results show that DPPL selects near-optimal subsets that maximize network sum-rate while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to traditional optimization methods, demonstrating its scalability for large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Controlled Invariance in Fully Actuated Max-plus Linear Systems with Precedence Semimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a max-plus linear system and a semimodule, the problem of computing the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule is still open to this day. In this paper, we consider this problem for the specific class of fully actuated systems and constraints in the form of precedence semimodules. The assumption of full actuation corresponds to the existence of an input for each component of the system state. A precedence semimodule is the set of solutions of inequalities typically used to represent time-window constraints. We prove that, in this setting, it is possible to (i) compute the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule and (ii) decide the convergence of a fixed-point algorithm introduced by R.D. Katz in strongly polynomial time.</description>

      <title>A Novel Multi-Criteria Local Latin Hypercube Refinement System for Commutation Angle Improvement in IPMSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commutation angle is defined as the angle between the fundamental of the motor phase current and the fundamental of the back-EMF. It can be utilised to provide a compensating effect in IPMSMs. This is due to the reluctance torque component being dependent on the commutation angle of the phase current even before entering the extended speed range. A real-time maximum torque per current and voltage strategy is demonstrated to find the trajectory and optimum commutation angles, gamma, where the level of accuracy depends on the application and available computational speed. A magnet volume reduction using a novel multi-criteria local Latin hypercube refinement (MLHR) sampling system is also presented to improve the optimisation process. The proposed new technique minimises the magnet mass to motor torque density whilst maintaining a similar phase current level. A mapping of gamma allows the determination of the optimum angles, as shown in this paper. The 3rd generation Toyota Prius IPMSM is considered as the reference motor, where the rotor configuration is altered to allow for an individual assessment.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Trajectories for Non-stop Flying Carriers Holding a Cable-Suspended Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multirotor UAVs have been typically considered for aerial manipulation, but their scarce endurance prevents long-lasting manipulation tasks. This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</description>

      <title>Potential gains of communication-compute-control co-design based performance optimization methods in cyber-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and quantitatively evaluate three performance optimization methods that exploit the concept of communication-compute-control co-design by introducing awareness of communication and compute characteristics into the application logic in different ways to improve overall system performance. We have implemented a closed-loop control of a robotic arm over a wireless network where the controller is deployed into an edge cloud environment. When implementing an industrial system that leverages network and cloud technologies, the level of determinism of the control application can be decreased by nature. This means that some imperfections may be introduced into the control system, and the closed-loop control in substance changes to open-loop during disturbances. We aim to improve the performance of these open-loop control periods by applying methods that can compensate for the imperfections statistically or in a guaranteed way. We demonstrate that co-design-based application improvements with minimal dependencies on the underlying technologies can already yield an order of magnitude gain when it comes to the accurate execution of the robot trajectories during the openloop control periods. Furthermore, by combining the proposed methods, the performance improvements add up and can produce up to 45% shorter trajectory executions compared to individual evaluations.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Application of Safety of The Intended Functionality to Mitigate Foreseeable Misuse in Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) has the potential to revolutionise the transportation industry, but it also presents significant safety challenges. One of the key challenges is ensuring that the ADS is safe in the event of Foreseeable Misuse (FM) by the human driver. To address this challenge, a case study on simulation-based testing to mitigate FM by the driver using the driving simulator is presented. FM by the human driver refers to potential driving scenarios where the driver misinterprets the intended functionality of ADS, leading to hazardous behaviour. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) focuses on ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk resulting from hazardous behaviours related to functional insufficiencies caused by FM and performance limitations of sensors and machine learning-based algorithms for ADS. The simulation-based application of SOTIF to mitigate FM in ADS entails determining potential misuse scenarios, conducting simulation-based testing, and evaluating the effectiveness of measures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM. The major contribution includes defining (i) test requirements for performing simulation-based testing of a potential misuse scenario, (ii) evaluation criteria in accordance with SOTIF requirements for implementing measures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM, and (iii) approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM. In conclusion, an exemplary case study incorporating driver-vehicle interface and driver interactions with ADS forming the basis for understanding the factors and causes contributing to FM is investigated. Furthermore, the test procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of the measures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM by the driver is developed in this work.</description>

Abstract: Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) addresses sensor performance limitations and deep learning-based object detection insufficiencies to ensure the intended functionality of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). This paper presents a methodology examining the adaptability and performance evaluation of the 3D object detection methods on a LiDAR point cloud dataset generated by simulating a SOTIF-related Use Case. The major contributions of this paper include defining and modelling a SOTIF-related Use Case with 21 diverse weather conditions and generating a LiDAR point cloud dataset suitable for application of 3D object detection methods. The dataset consists of 547 frames, encompassing clear, cloudy, rainy weather conditions, corresponding to different times of the day, including noon, sunset, and night. Employing MMDetection3D and OpenPCDET toolkits, the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods is evaluated and compared by testing the pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models on the generated dataset using Average Precision (AP) and Recall metrics.</description>

      <title>Towards an Emotion-Aware Metaverse: A Human-Centric Shipboard Fire Drill Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional XR and Metaverse applications prioritize user experience (UX) for adoption and success but often overlook a crucial aspect of user interaction: emotions. This article addresses this gap by presenting an emotion-aware Metaverse application: a Virtual Reality (VR) fire drill simulator designed to prepare crews for shipboard emergencies. The simulator detects emotions in real time, assessing trainees responses under stress to improve learning outcomes. Its architecture incorporates eye-tracking and facial expression analysis via Meta Quest Pro headsets. The system features four levels whose difficulty is increased progressively to evaluate user decision-making and emotional resilience. The system was evaluated in two experimental phases. The first phase identified challenges, such as navigation issues and lack of visual guidance. These insights led to an improved second version with a better user interface, visual cues and a real-time task tracker. Performance metrics like completion times, task efficiency and emotional responses were analyzed. The obtained results show that trainees with prior VR or gaming experience navigated the scenarios more efficiently. Moreover, the addition of task-tracking visuals and navigation guidance significantly improved user performance, reducing task completion times between 14.18\% and 32.72\%. Emotional responses were captured, revealing that some participants were engaged, while others acted indifferently, indicating the need for more immersive elements. Overall, this article provides useful guidelines for creating the next generation of emotion-aware Metaverse applications.</description>

      <title>Domain Consistent Industrial Decarbonisation of Global Coal Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and optimisation techniques (MLOPT) hold significant potential to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial systems by enabling data-driven operational improvements. However, the practical application of MLOPT in industrial settings is often hindered by a lack of domain compliance and system-specific consistency, resulting in suboptimal solutions with limited real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop (HITL) constraint-based optimisation framework that integrates domain expertise with data-driven methods, ensuring solutions are both technically sound and operationally feasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through a case study focused on enhancing the thermal efficiency and reducing the turbine heat rate of a 660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant. By embedding domain knowledge as constraints within the optimisation process, our approach yields solutions that align with the plant's operational patterns and are seamlessly integrated into its control systems. Empirical validation confirms a mean improvement in thermal efficiency of 0.64\% and a mean reduction in turbine heat rate of 93 kJ/kWh. Scaling our analysis to 59 global coal power plants with comparable capacity and fuel type, we estimate a cumulative lifetime reduction of 156.4 million tons of carbon emissions. These results underscore the transformative potential of our HITL-MLOPT framework in delivering domain-compliant, implementable solutions for industrial decarbonisation, offering a scalable pathway to mitigate the environmental impact of coal-based power generation worldwide.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of an IoT Cluster with Raspberry Pi Powered by Solar Energy: A Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents the design and implementation of a low-power IoT server cluster, based on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and powered by solar energy. The proposed architecture integrates Kubernetes (K3s) and Docker, providing an efficient, scalable, and high-performance computing environment. The cluster is designed to optimize energy consumption, leveraging a 200W solar panel system and a 100Ah lithium-ion battery to support continuous operation under favorable environmental conditions. Performance analysis was conducted based on theoretical inferences and data obtained from external sources, evaluating resource allocation, power consumption, and service availability. These analyses provide theoretical estimates of the system's operational feasibility under different scenarios. The results suggest that this system can serve as a viable and sustainable alternative for edge computing applications and cloud services, reducing dependence on traditional data centers. In addition to its positive impact on environmental sustainability by significantly reducing the carbon footprint, this solution also addresses economic concerns, as conventional data centers consume enormous amounts of energy, leading to increased demand on the power grid and higher operational costs.</description>

      <title>TeraSim: Uncovering Unknown Unsafe Events for Autonomous Vehicles through Generative Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03629v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning and Control with Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics through Predicted Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous motion planning under unknown nonlinear dynamics presents significant challenges. An agent needs to continuously explore the system dynamics to acquire its properties, such as reachability, in order to guide system navigation adaptively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid planning-control framework designed to compute a feasible trajectory toward a target. Our approach involves partitioning the state space and approximating the system by a piecewise affine (PWA) system with constrained control inputs. By abstracting the PWA system into a directed weighted graph, we incrementally update the existence of its edges via affine system identification and reach control theory, introducing a predictive reachability condition by exploiting prior information of the unknown dynamics. Heuristic weights are assigned to edges based on whether their existence is certain or remains indeterminate. Consequently, we propose a framework that adaptively collects and analyzes data during mission execution, continually updates the predictive graph, and synthesizes a controller online based on the graph search outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulation scenarios involving a mobile robot operating in unknown terrains, with its unknown dynamics abstracted as a single integrator model.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization by Network Flows with Spatio-Temporal Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several data compressors have been proposed in distributed optimization frameworks of network systems to reduce communication overhead in large-scale applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Geometric Impedance Control on SE(3) for Robotic Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After its introduction, impedance control has been utilized as a primary control scheme for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction with unknown environments. While impedance control has been extensively studied, the geometric structure of SE(3) for the robotic manipulator itself and its use in formulating a robotic task has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a differential geometric approach to impedance control. Given a left-invariant error metric in SE(3), the corresponding error vectors in position and velocity are first derived. We then propose the impedance control schemes that adequately account for the geometric structure of the manipulator in SE(3) based on a left-invariant potential function. The closed-loop stabilities for the proposed control schemes are verified using Lyapunov function-based analysis. The proposed control design clearly outperformed a conventional impedance control approach when tracking challenging trajectory profiles.</description>

      <title>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar and wind power are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, yet their intermittent nature presents challenges. Significant temporal and geographic differences in land, wind, and solar resources suggest that long-distance transmission could be particularly beneficial. Using a detailed, open-source model, we analyze optimal transmission expansion jointly with storage, generation, and hourly operations across the three primary interconnects in the United States. Transmission expansion offers far more benefits in a high-renewable system than in a system with mostly conventional generation. Yet while an optimal nationwide plan would have more than triple current interregional transmission, transmission decreases the cost of a 100% clean system by only 7% compared to a plan that relies solely on current transmission. Expanding capacity only within existing interconnects can achieve most of these savings. Adjustments to energy storage and generation mix can leverage the current interregional transmission infrastructure to build a clean power system at a reasonable cost.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that takes the form of an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>Learning Maximal Safe Sets Using Hypernetworks for MPC-based Local Trajectory Planning in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online estimation of maximal safe sets for local trajectory planning in unknown static environments. The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show a success rate increase of up to 52 \% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</description>

      <title>Joint-repositionable Inner-wireless Planar Snake Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bio-inspired multi-joint snake robots offer the advantages of terrain adaptability due to their limbless structure and high flexibility. However, a series of dozens of motor units in typical multiple-joint snake robots results in a heavy body structure and hundreds of watts of high power consumption. This paper presents a joint-repositionable, inner-wireless snake robot that enables multi-joint-like locomotion using a low-powered underactuated mechanism. The snake robot, consisting of a series of flexible passive links, can dynamically change its joint coupling configuration by repositioning motor-driven joint units along rack gears inside the robot. Additionally, a soft robot skin wirelessly powers the internal joint units, avoiding the risk of wire tangling and disconnection caused by the movable joint units. The combination of the joint-repositionable mechanism and the wireless-charging-enabled soft skin achieves a high degree of bending, along with a lightweight structure of 1.3 kg and energy-efficient wireless power transmission of 7.6 watts.</description>

      <title>DMVC-Tracker: Distributed Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking Using Dynamic Buffered Voronoi and Inter-Visibility Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a distributed trajectory planning method for multi-agent aerial tracking. The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Dependent Control Lyapunov Functions for Stabilizing Nonlinear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of parameter-dependent (PD) control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for gain-scheduled stabilization of nonlinear parameter-varying (NPV) systems. It shows that given a PD-CLF, a min-norm control law can be constructed by solving a robust quadratic program. For polynomial control-affine NPV systems, it provides convex conditions, based on the sum of squares programming, to jointly synthesize a PD-CLF and a PD controller while maximizing the PD region of stabilization. Input constraints can be straightforwardly incorporated into the synthesis procedure. Unlike traditional linear parameter-varying (LPV) methods that rely on linearization or over-approximation to get an LPV model, the proposed framework fully captures the nonlinearities of the system dynamics. The theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations, including a 2D rocket landing case study under varying mass and inertia.</description>

      <title>TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems. TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</description>
