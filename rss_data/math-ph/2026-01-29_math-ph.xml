      <title>The variable-length stem structures in three-soliton resonance of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stem structure is a localized feature that arises during high-order soliton interactions, connecting the vertices of two V-shaped waveforms. The interaction of resonant 3-solitons is accompanied by soliton reconnection phenomena, characterized by the disappearance and reconnection of stem structures. This paper investigates variable-length stem structures in resonant 3-soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KPII) equation, focusing on both 2-resonant and 3-resonant 3-soliton cases. Depending on the phase shift tends to plus/minus infinity, different types of resonances are identified, including strong resonance, weak resonance, and mixed (strong-weak) resonance. We derive and analyze the asymptotic forms and explicit expressions for the soliton arm trajectories, velocities, as well as the endpoints, length, and amplitude of the stem structures. A detailed comparison is made between the similarities and differences of the stem structures in the 2-resonant and 3-resonant solitons. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of both the asymptotic behavior and the structural properties of the stems.</description>

      <title>Miniatures on Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presents a unified and concise exposition of key topics in the mathematical theory of open quantum systems, developed within the framework of operator algebras. The manuscript consolidates and extends a series of invited articles originally prepared for the Modern Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, combining foundational material with modern perspectives on non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. After introducing the C*- and W*-algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, the paper reviews quantum dynamical systems, KMS states, and Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, as well as CCR and CAR algebras for bosonic and fermionic systems. Particular emphasis is placed on infinite systems, non-equilibrium steady states, entropy production, and linear response theory. The later sections develop a systematic treatment of small systems coupled to reservoirs, open lattice quantum spin systems, culminating in a detailed discussion of competing notions of quantum entropy production. The presentation highlights structural insights, conceptual clarity, and connections between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena, providing a self-contained reference for researchers and graduate students in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Range Model for the Efimov Effect in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the Efimov effect emerging in a three-particle quantum system with zero-range interactions. In particular, we consider two non-interacting identical bosons plus a different lighter particle such that the interaction between a boson and the light particle is resonant. We also assume the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Under these conditions, we show that the three-particle system exhibits infinitely many negative eigenvalues which accumulate at zero and satisfy the universal geometrical law characterising the Efimov effect. The result we find is a generalisation of previous results recently obtained in [13, 24].</description>

      <title>Spectral Codes: A Geometric Formalism for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.</description>

      <title>The homological algebra of 2d integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a detailed and rigorous study of $4d$ semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theories and their associated $2d$ integrable field theories from the homological perspective of $L_\infty$-algebras. Through the use of homotopy transfer techniques, it is shown precisely how both the integrable field theory and its corresponding Lax connection emerge from the $4d$ theory, which results in a novel perspective on Lax connections in terms of $L_\infty$-morphisms.</description>

      <title>F-symbols and R-symbols for the Drinfeld center of the Haagerup subfactor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently devised and implemented an algorithm for computing the Drinfeld center of a fusion category in our software package \textsc{TensorCategories.jl}. By simplifying the field of definition of the F-symbols, R-symbols, and pivotal coefficients of the Haagerup H3 category, we were now able to compute explicit F-symbols, R-symbols, and pivotal coefficients for its Drinfeld center Z(H3). In this paper, we discuss how to access this data. We also present our new general algorithm for finding a gauge of a multiplicity-free fusion category in which the symbols belong to a minimal field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that unlike space-like and time-like hypersurfaces, null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds do not naturally inherit an affine connection from the spacetime in which they are embedded. On the other hand, recent developments in flat-space holography motivate the study of the intrinsic geometry of null hypersurfaces such as null infinity and black hole event horizons. Here we initiate the study of potential Carroll structures, a candidate for an intrinsic description of null hypersurfaces which may be particularly useful in settings where conformal isometries are of interest, and we explore their relationship to another such candidate intrinsic geometry, the special Carrollian manifolds.</description>

      <title>First-Hitting Location Laws as Boundary Observables of Drift--Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate first-hitting location (FHL) statistics induced by drift--diffusion processes in domains with absorbing boundaries, and examine how such boundary laws give rise to intrinsic information observables. Rather than introducing explicit encoding or decoding mechanisms, information is viewed as emerging directly from the geometry and dynamics of stochastic transport through first-passage events. Treating the FHL as the primary observable, we characterize how geometry and drift jointly shape the induced boundary measure. In diffusion-dominated regimes, the exit law exhibits scale-free, heavy-tailed spatial fluctuations along the boundary, whereas a nonzero drift component introduces an intrinsic length scale that suppresses these tails and reorganizes the exit statistics. Within a generator-based formulation, the FHL arises naturally as a boundary measure induced by an elliptic operator, allowing explicit boundary kernels to be derived analytically in canonical geometries. Planar absorbing boundaries in different ambient dimensions are examined as benchmark cases, illustrating how directed transport regularizes diffusion-driven fluctuations and induces qualitative transitions in boundary statistics. Overall, the present work provides a unified structural framework for first-hitting location laws and highlights FHL statistics as natural probes of geometry, drift, and irreversibility in stochastic transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate Gaussian averages of arbitrary exponentials of the matrix variable $X$ with the help of superintegrability, which provides explicit expressions for Schur averages. As in the simpler cases the answer is expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials, but in a somewhat sophisticated way. It involves triangular sum over partitions, with simple exponential factor and a complicated polynomial prefactor. Some ingredients of the formula are not found in full generality and there is still a room for further work.</description>

      <title>A Unified Variational Functional for Equidistribution and Alignment in Moving Mesh Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing variational mesh functionals often suffer from strong nonlinearity or dependence on empirical parameters.We propose a new variational functional for adaptive moving mesh generation that enforces equidistribution and alignment through an $\boldsymbol A$-pullback formulation, where $\boldsymbol A=\boldsymbol J^{-1}\boldsymbol M^{-1}\boldsymbol J^{-T}$. The functional combines a trace-based term with a logarithmic determinant term, achieving balanced control of mesh size and anisotropy without empirical parameters. We establish coercivity, polyconvexity, existence of minimizers, and geodesic convexity with respect to the inverse Jacobian, and derive a simplified geometric discretization leading to an efficient moving mesh algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical properties and demonstrate robust adaptive behavior for function-induced meshes and Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative minimal model program, as proposed by Halpern-Leistner, for Fano varieties. We construct lifts of Iritani's quantum cohomology central charge in the following examples: Grassmannians, smooth quadrics, and smooth cubic threefolds and fourfolds. Moreover, we verify that these lifted paths are quasi-convergent and give rise to the expected semiorthogonal decompositions of the bounded derived category. We also construct geometric stability conditions in the examples above and observe that, after suitable isomonodromic deformation of the quantum cohomology central charge, the quasi-convergent paths for Grassmannians and quadrics can be chosen to start in the geometric region.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-generating algebra and intertwiners of the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator at the resonant (equal-frequency) point, where the dynamics becomes non-diagonalisable and the conventional Fock-space construction collapses. At the classical level, the degenerate system admits more than one Hamiltonian formulation generating the same equations of motion, leading to a nontrivial quantisation ambiguity. Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.
  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator provides a concrete example in which classically equivalent Hamiltonians define inequivalent quantum theories.</description>

Abstract: We propose a systematic framework for constructing geometric integrators for Hamiltonian systems on Jacobi manifolds. By combining Poissonization of Jacobi structures with homogeneous symplectic bi-realizations, Jacobi dynamics are lifted to homogeneous Poisson Hamiltonian systems, enabling the construction of structure-preserving Jacobi Hamiltonian integrators. The resulting schemes are constructed explicitly and applied to a range of examples, including contact Hamiltonian systems and classical models. Numerical experiments highlight their qualitative advantages over standard integrators, including better preservation of geometric structure and improved long-time behavior.</description>

The result holds for a wide variety of target categories (or $(\infty,n)$-categories) and arbitrary tangential structures.

      <title>Fast Solvers for the Reynolds Equation on Piecewise Linear Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from $2019$ introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the Random-Cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors, through a quadrichotomy, is established. Novel renormalization arguments for crossing probabilities that the authors propose are studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, specifically for the dilute Potts model. The probability measure of this model, through a suitably defined spin representation, is obtained from the high-temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model whose possible range of behaviors can be analyzed through a quadrichotomy; the range of four possible behaviors of the model can be respectively characterized at subcriticality, or supercriticality, in addition to either being critical discontinuous, or critical continuous. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces and breather dynamics of analytic solutions in Heisenberg exchange-free chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$% -wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We also study magneto-optical conductivity, magnetic circular dichroism and Friedel oscillations in the $X$-wave magnets. Various analytic formulas are derived in the case of two-band Hamiltonians. This paper presents a review of recent progress together with some original results.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence results for a nonlocal isoperimetric problem on $\mathbb{H}^n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the minimization problem of a nonlocal isoperimetric functional with a competition between perimeter and a nonlocal term derived from the negative power of the distance function, has been extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate this nonlocal isoperimetric problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that the geodesic balls are unique minimizers (up to hyperbolic isometries) for small volumes $m$ and obtain nonexistence results for large volumes $m$ under certain ranges of the exponent in the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Brownian loop soup clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Brownian loop soup clusters in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for an arbitrary intensity $\alpha&gt;0$. We show the existence of a phase transition for the presence of unbounded clusters and study its basic properties. In particular, we show that, when $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, almost surely all the loops are connected into a single cluster. Such a phenomenon is not observed in discrete percolation-type models. In addition, we prove the existence of a one-arm exponent and compare the clusters with the finite-range system obtained by imposing lower and upper bounds on the diameter of the loops.
  Finally, we provide a toolbox concerning the Brownian loop measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 3$. In particular, we derive decomposition formulas by rerooting the loops in specific ways and show that the loop measure is conformally invariant, generalising results of [Lup18] in dimension 1 and [LW04] in dimension 2.</description>
