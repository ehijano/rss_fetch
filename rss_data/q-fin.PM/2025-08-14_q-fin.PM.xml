      <title>Optimal Control of Reserve Asset Portfolios for Pegged Digital Currencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins promise par convertibility, yet issuers must balance immediate liquidity against yield on reserves to keep the peg credible. We study this treasury problem as a continuous-time control task with two instruments: reallocating reserves between cash and short-duration government bills, and setting a spread fee for either minting or burning the coin. Mint and redemption flows follow mutually exciting processes that reproduce clustered order flow; peg deviations arise when redemptions exceed liquid reserves within settlement windows. We develop a stochastic model predictive control framework that incorporates moment closure for event intensities. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we demonstrate that the optimal control exhibits a bang-off-bang structure: each asset type is purchased at maximum capacity when the utility difference exceeds the corresponding difference in shadow costs. Introducing settlement windows leads to a sampled-data implementation with a simple threshold (soft-thresholding) structure for rebalancing. We also establish a monotone stress-response property: as expected outflows intensify or windows lengthen, the optimal policy shifts predictably toward cash. In simulations covering various stress test scenarios, the controller preserves most bill carry in calm markets, builds cash quickly when stress emerges, and avoids unnecessary rotations under transitory signals. The proposed policy is implementation-ready and aligns naturally with operational cut-offs. Our results translate empirical flow risk into auditable treasury rules that improve peg quality without sacrificing avoidable carry.</description>

      <title>Return Prediction for Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection: How Decision-Focused Learning Shapes Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markowitz laid the foundation of portfolio theory through the mean-variance optimization (MVO) framework. However, the effectiveness of MVO is contingent on the precise estimation of expected returns, variances, and covariances of asset returns, which are typically uncertain. Machine learning models are becoming useful in estimating uncertain parameters, and such models are trained to minimize prediction errors, such as mean squared errors (MSE), which treat prediction errors uniformly across assets. Recent studies have pointed out that this approach would lead to suboptimal decisions and proposed Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) as a solution, integrating prediction and optimization to improve decision-making outcomes. While studies have shown DFL's potential to enhance portfolio performance, the detailed mechanisms of how DFL modifies prediction models for MVO remain unexplored. This study investigates how DFL adjusts stock return prediction models to optimize decisions in MVO. Theoretically, we show that DFL's gradient can be interpreted as tilting the MSE-based prediction errors by the inverse covariance matrix, effectively incorporating inter-asset correlations into the learning process, while MSE treats each asset's error independently. This tilting mechanism leads to systematic prediction biases where DFL overestimates returns for assets included in portfolios while underestimating excluded assets. Our findings reveal why DFL achieves superior portfolio performance despite higher prediction errors. The strategic biases are features, not flaws.</description>
