      <title>On a stochastic epidemic SIR model with non homogenous population: a toy model for HIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalise a simple discrete time stochastic SIR type model defined by Tuckwell and Williams. The SIR model by Tuckwell and Williams assumes a homogeneous population, a fixed infectious period, and a strict transition from susceptible to infected to recovered. In contrast, our model introduces two groups, $A$ and $B$, where group $B$ has a higher risk of infection due to increased contact rates. Additionally, the duration in the infected class follows a probability distribution rather than being fixed. Finally, individuals in group $B$ can transition directly to the recovered class R, allowing us to analyze the impact of this preventive measure on disease spread. Finally, we apply this model to the spread of HIV, analyzing how risk behaviors, rapid testing, and PrEP-like therapies influence the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modelling Immunity in Agent-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination policies play a central role in public health interventions and models are often used to assess the effectiveness of these policies. Many vaccines are leaky, in which case the observed vaccine effectiveness depends on the force of infection. Within models, the immunity parameters required for agent-based models to achieve observed vaccine effectiveness values are further influenced by model features such as its transmission algorithm, contact network structure, and approach to simulating vaccination. We present a method for determining parameters in agent-based models such that a set of target immunity values is achieved. We construct a dataset of desired population-level immunity values against various disease outcomes considering both vaccination and prior infection from COVID-19. This dataset incorporates immunological data, data collection methodologies, immunity models, and biological insights. We then describe how we choose minimal parameters for continuous waning immunity curves that result in those target values being realized in simulations. We use simulations of the household secondary attack rates to establish a relationship between the protection per infection attempt and overall immunity, thus accounting for the dependence of protection from acquisition on model features and the force of infection.</description>

      <title>Use of Topological Data Analysis for the Detection of Phenomenological Bifurcations in Stochastic Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate predictions of stochastic compartmental models on the severity of disease outbreaks. The models we consider are the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) for bacterial infections, and the Susceptible -Infected-Removed (SIR) for airborne diseases. Stochasticity enters the compartmental models as random fluctuations of the contact rate, to account for uncertainties in the disease spread. We consider three types of noise to model the random fluctuations: the Gaussian white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises, and the logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (logOU). The advantages of logOU noise are its positivity and its ability to model the presence of superspreaders. We utilize homological bifurcation plots from Topological Data Analysis to automatically determine the shape of the long-time distributions of the number of infected for the SIS, and removed for the SIR model, over a range of basic reproduction numbers and relative noise intensities. LogOU noise results in distributions that stay close to the endemic deterministic equilibrium even for high noise intensities. For low reproduction rates and increasing intensity, the distribution peak shifts towards zero, that is, disease eradication, for all three noises; for logOU noise the shift is the slowest. Our study underlines the sensitivity of model predictions to the type of noise considered in contact rate.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Risk of HPAIV Transmission to Danish Cattle via Wild Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) panzootic has severely impacted wild bird populations worldwide, with documented (zoonotic) transmission to mammals, including humans. Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have raised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in other countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool, coordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in wild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the cattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This study aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV) spillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in Denmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is developed by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and Bird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated quantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial distribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark. The highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The estimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48, 4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025 (up to April). These risk estimates provide valuable insights to support veterinary contingency planning and enable targeted allocation of resources in highrisk areas for the early detection of HPAIV in cattle.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree II: Overview and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively (from the root) split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of this model (in discrete or continuous versions) is an active research topic. For many results there are different proofs, probabilistic or analytic, so the model provides a testbed for a ``compare and contrast" discussion of techniques. This article provides an overview of results proved in the sequence of similarly-titled articles I, III, IV and related articles. We mostly do not repeat proofs given elsewhere: instead we seek to paint a ``Big Picture" via graphics and heuristics, and emphasize open problems.
  Our discussion is centered around three categories of results. (i) There is a CLT for leaf heights, and the analytic proofs can be extended to provide surprisingly precise analysis of other height-related aspects. (ii) There is an explicit description of the limit {\em fringe distribution} relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies. (iii) There is a canonical embedding of the discrete model into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. The family (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction of (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure CTCS($\infty$) formalized via exchangeable partitions.
  Many open problems remain, in particular to elucidate a relation between CTCS($\infty$) and the $\beta(2,1)$ coalescent.</description>

      <title>Exponential rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex networks, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>
