      <title>Soliton profiles: Classical Numerical Schemes vs. Neural Network - Based Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schr\"odinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Fracture Structure of Sumi-Wari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local variations in surface tension can induce complex fracture dynamics in thin interfacial films. Here, we investigate the fracture patterns that emerge when a localized surface-tension perturbation is applied to a sumi film supported on a water-glycerol subphase. Sumi is a traditional Japanese carbon black ink, and this process, referred to as sumi-wari, produces aesthetically pleasing, star-shaped crack patterns with multiple spikes radiating from the perturbation site. The number of crack spikes increases with the viscosity of the subphase, controlled here by the addition of glycerol. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the effective stiffness of the sumi f ilm decreases as glycerol concentration increases. This suggests a strong coupling between the subphase properties and the mechanics of the sumi film. To capture the dynamics of sumi-wari, a phenomenological model is outlined, based on an overdamped equation of motion for particles connected by breakable springs. Numerical simulations reproduce both the morphology and the experimental trends of sumi-wari: the number of cracks and their temporal evolution depend on the spring stiffness, mirroring the behavior observed for subphases with different viscosities. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between surface-tension gradients, subphase properties, and film mechanics governs local fracture and pattern formation in fluid-supported thin films</description>

      <title>Contact-Geometric Dynamics for Dissipative Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative nonlinear waves are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium physical systems, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (CGLE) serves as a fundamental model for describing their dynamics. This paper develops a contact-geometric formulation of dissipative field theories, extending the least constraint theorem to complex fields and establishing a link between contact geometry and probability measures. By applying this framework to the 2D CGLE, we derive the dissipative Contact Hamilton-Jacobi (CHJ) equation, which governs the evolution of the action functional. Through canonical transformation and travelling-wave reduction, exact solutions of the CHJ equation are obtained. From a probabilistic perspective, we derive the probability density functional of the 2D CGLE, identify a universal switching line that separates different dynamical regimes, and reveal a first-order periodon--soliton phase transition with a hysteresis loop. The conserved contact potential is identified as the key geometric quantity governing pattern formation in dissipative media, playing a role analogous to energy in conservative systems. This contact-geometric framework provides a unified analytical tool for studying pattern selection and state transitions.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Virial Identities: Radial Constraints for Solitons, Instantons, and Bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $\alpha$ that controls the radial weighting. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $\alpha$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $\alpha$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $\alpha$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $\alpha$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $\alpha$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales.</description>
