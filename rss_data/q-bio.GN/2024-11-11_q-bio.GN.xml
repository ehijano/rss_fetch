      <title>Integrating Large Language Models for Genetic Variant Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of genetic variants, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), poses a significant challenge in clinical genetics and precision medicine. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in this realm. These models can uncover intricate patterns and predictive insights that traditional methods might miss, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of genetic variant pathogenicity.
  This study investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPN-MSA, ESM1b, and AlphaMissense, which leverage DNA and protein sequence data alongside structural insights to form a comprehensive analytical framework for variant classification. Our approach evaluates these integrated models using the well-annotated ProteinGym and ClinVar datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. The models were rigorously tested on a set of challenging variants, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art tools, especially in handling ambiguous and clinically uncertain variants.
  The results of this research underline the efficacy of combining multiple modeling approaches to significantly refine the accuracy and reliability of genetic variant classification systems. These findings support the deployment of these advanced computational models in clinical environments, where they can significantly enhance the diagnostic processes for genetic disorders, ultimately pushing the boundaries of personalized medicine by offering more detailed and actionable genetic insights.</description>

      <title>Use of 3D chaos game representation to quantify DNA sequence similarity with applications for hierarchical clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3D chaos game is shown to be a useful way for encoding DNA sequences. Since matching subsequences in DNA converge in space in 3D chaos game encoding, a DNA sequence's 3D chaos game representation can be used to compare DNA sequences without prior alignment and without truncating or padding any of the sequences. Two proposed methods inspired by shape-similarity comparison techniques show that this form of encoding can perform as well as alignment-based techniques for building phylogenetic trees. The first method uses the volume overlap of intersecting spheres and the second uses shape signatures by summarizing the coordinates, oriented angles, and oriented distances of the 3D chaos game trajectory. The methods are tested using: (1) the first exon of the beta-globin gene for 11 species, (2) mitochondrial DNA from four groups of primates, and (3) a set of synthetic DNA sequences. Simulations show that the proposed methods produce distances that reflect the number of mutation events; additionally, on average, distances resulting from deletion mutations are comparable to those produced by substitution mutations.</description>

      <title>Safe Paths and Sequences for Scalable ILPs in RNA Transcript Assembly Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common step at the core of many RNA transcript assembly tools is to find a set of weighted paths that best explain the weights of a DAG. While such problems easily become NP-hard, scalable solvers exist only for a basic error-free version of this problem, namely minimally decomposing a network flow into weighted paths.
  The main result of this paper is to show that we can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude also for path-finding problems in the realistic setting (i.e., the weights do not induce a flow). We obtain these by employing the safety information that is encoded in the graph structure inside Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solvers for these problems. We first characterize the paths that appear in all path covers of the DAG, generalizing a graph reduction commonly used in the error-free setting (e.g. by Kloster et al. [ALENEX~2018]). Secondly, following the work of Ma, Zheng and Kingsford [RECOMB 2021], we characterize the \emph{sequences} of arcs that appear in all path covers of the DAG.
  We experiment with a path-finding ILP model (least squares) and with a more recent and accurate one. We use a variety of datasets originally created by Shao and Kingsford [TCBB, 2017], as well as graphs built from sequencing reads by the state-of-the-art tool for long-read transcript discovery, IsoQuant [Prjibelski et al., Nat.~Biotechnology~2023]. The ILPs armed with safe paths or sequences exhibit significant speed-ups over the original ones. On graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range $50-160\times$ in the latter ILP model and in the range $100-1000\times$ in the least squares model.
  Our scaling techniques apply to any ILP whose solution paths are a path cover of the arcs of the DAG. As such, they can become a scalable building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, avoiding heuristic trade-offs currently needed on complex graphs.</description>
