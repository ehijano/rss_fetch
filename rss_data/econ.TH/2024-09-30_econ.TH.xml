      <title>Dynamic Competition for Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies information transmission from multiple senders who compete for the attention of a decision maker. Each sender is partially informed about the state of the world and decides how to reveal her information over time to maximise attention. A decision maker wants to learn about the state but faces an attention cost. We derive a condition on the informational environment and the decision problem that guarantees that all information from the senders can be transmitted to the decision maker in equilibrium. A simple class of information processes implements full transmission across general environments. The attention each sender receives is proportional to the residual value of her information. In the case of conditionally iid-informed senders, in the limit as the number of senders grows large, the receiver learns the state exactly and immediately (at no attention cost).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic risk aversion, defined through quasi-convexity in probabilistic mixtures, is a common useful property in decision analysis. We study a general class of non-monotone mappings, called the generalized rank-dependent functions, which includes the preference models of expected utilities, dual utilities, and rank-dependent utilities as special cases, as well as signed Choquet functions used in risk management. Our results fully characterize probabilistic risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions: This property is determined by the distortion function, which is precisely one of the two cases: those that are convex and those that correspond to scaled quantile-spread mixtures. Our result also leads to seven equivalent conditions for quasi-convexity in probabilistic mixtures of dual utilities and signed Choquet functions. As a consequence, although probabilistic risk aversion is quite different from the classic notion of strong risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions, these two notions coincide for dual utilities under an additional continuity assumption.</description>
