      <title>Partially Polarized Polar Codes: A New Design for 6G Control Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of polar-like codes, called Partially Polarized Polar (PPP) codes. PPP codes are constructed from conventional polar codes by selectively pruning polarization kernels, thereby modifying the synthesized bit-channel capacities to ensure a guaranteed number of non-frozen bits available early in decoding. These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information. Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling. Compared with existing methods such as aggregation or segmentation, PPP codes achieve higher efficiency without the need for additional hardware support. Finally, we propose several frozen-bitmap design strategies tailored to PPP codes.</description>

      <title>Rank-metric codes over arbitrary fields: Bounds and constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes, defined as sets of matrices over a finite field with the rank distance, have gained significant attention due to their applications in network coding and connections to diverse mathematical areas. Initially studied by Delsarte in 1978 and later rediscovered by Gabidulin, these codes have become a central topic in coding theory. This paper surveys the development and mathematical foundations, in particular, regarding bounds and constructions of rank-metric codes, emphasizing their extension beyond finite fields to more general settings. We examine Singleton-like bounds on code parameters, demonstrating their sharpness in finite field cases and contrasting this with contexts where the bounds are not tight. Furthermore, we discuss constructions of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over fields with cyclic Galois extensions and the relationship between linear rank-metric codes with systems and evasive subspaces. The paper also reviews results for algebraically closed fields and real numbers, previously appearing in the context of topology and measure theory. We conclude by proposing future research directions, including conjectures on MRD code existence and the exploration of rank-metric codes over various field extensions.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Code Channel Transforms Beyond Repetition Codes for Improved Hashing Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum hashing bound guarantees that rates up to $1-H(p_I, p_X, p_Y, p_Z)$ are achievable for memoryless Pauli channels, but it is not generally tight. A known way to improve achievable rates for certain asymmetric Pauli channels is to apply a small inner stabilizer code to a few channel uses, decode, and treat the resulting logical noise as an induced Pauli channel; reapplying the hashing argument to this induced channel can beat the baseline hashing bound. We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\![ n, k ]\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work.</description>

      <title>A Class of Subadditive Information Measures and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter family of discrepancy measures, termed \emph{$(G,f)$-divergences}, obtained by applying a non-decreasing function $G$ to an $f$-divergence $D_f$. Building on Csisz\'ar's formulation of mutual $f$-information, we define a corresponding $(G,f)$-information measure $
I_{G,f}(X;Y)$. A central theme of the paper is subadditivity over product distributions and product channels. We develop reduction principles showing that, for broad classes of $G$, it suffices to verify divergence subadditivity on binary alphabets. Specializing to the functions $G(x)\in\{x,\log(1+x),-\log(1-x)\}$, we derive tractable sufficient conditions on $f$ that guarantee subadditivity, covering many standard $f$-divergences. Finally, we present applications to finite-blocklength converses for channel coding, bounds in binary hypothesis testing, and an extension of the Shannon--Gallager--Berlekamp sphere-packing exponent framework to subadditive $(G,f)$-divergences.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Empowered Semantic Twin Channel Model for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) increasingly exposes a gap in today's channel modeling. Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.</description>

      <title>Generalized Information Inequalities via Submodularity, and Two Combinatorial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a strong connection between entropy inequalities and submodularity, since the entropy of a collection of random variables is a submodular function. Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.</description>

      <title>Recursive Flow: A Generative Framework for MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, where estimation accuracy governs the spectral efficiency and link reliability. In this work, we introduce Recursive Flow (RC-Flow), a novel solver that leverages pre-trained flow matching priors to robustly recover channel state information from noisy, under-determined measurements. Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.</description>

      <title>Practical applications of Set Shaping Theory to Non-Uniform Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) &lt; NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work</description>

      <title>Blind Identification of Channel Codes: A Subspace-Coding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of blind identification of channel codes at a receiver involves identifying a code chosen by a transmitter from a known code-family, by observing the transmitted codewords through the channel. Most existing approaches for code-identification are contingent upon the codes in the family having some special structure, and are often computationally expensive otherwise. Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC. Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our decoder for random linear codes beyond existing general-purpose techniques, across most channel conditions and even with a limited number of received vectors.</description>

      <title>A Remark on Downlink Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In downlink massive random access (DMRA), a base station transmits messages to a typically small subset of active users, selected randomly from a massive number of total users. Explicitly encoding the identities of active users would incur a significant overhead scaling logarithmically with the number of total users. Recently, via a random coding argument, Song, Attiah and Yu have shown that the overhead can be reduced to within some upper bound irrespective of the number of total users. In this remark, recognizing that the code design for DMRA is an instance of covering arrays in combinatorics, we show that there exists deterministic construction of variable-length codes that incur an overhead no greater than $1 + log_2 e$ bits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks possess incredible capabilities for extracting abstract features from data. Electromagnetic computing harnesses wave propagation to execute computational operations. Metasurfaces, composed of subwavelength meta-atoms, are capable of engineering electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways. What happens when combining these three cutting-edge technologies? This question has sparked a surge of interest in designing physical neural networks using stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology, with the aim of implementing various computational tasks by directly processing electromagnetic waves. SIMs open up an exciting avenue toward high-speed, massively parallel, and low-power signal processing in the electromagnetic domain. This article provides a comprehensive overview of SIM technology, commencing with its evolutionary development. We subsequently examine its theoretical foundations and existing SIM prototypes in depth. Furthermore, the optimization/training strategies conceived to configure SIMs for achieving the desired functionalities are discussed from two different perspectives. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of SIM technology across the communication, sensing, and computing domains, presenting experimental evidence that highlights its distinctive advantages in supporting multiple functions within a single device. Finally, we identify critical technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy SIMs in next-generation wireless networks and shed light on promising research directions to unlock their full potential.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Cooperative ISAC Network for Imaging-Based Low-Altitude Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy is integral to the advancement of numerous sectors, necessitating the development of advanced low-altitude surveillance techniques. Nevertheless, conventional methods encounter limitations of high deployment costs and low signal strength. This study proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network for low-altitude surveillance. This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration. Numerical results show that ARIS outperforms passive RIS under identical power constraints, achieving effective imaging and target detection at altitudes up to 300 meters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tri-hybrid beamforming architectures have been proposed to enable energy-efficient communications systems in extra-largescale antenna arrays using low-cost programmable metasurface antennas. We study the tri-hybrid beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to improve both communications and sensing performances. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances communications signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the sensing power at a target direction, subject to constraints on the total power consumption and physical limitations inherent to the trihybrid beamforming architecture. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm in which the variables are updated in a closed form at each iteration, leading to a low-complexity and fast-execution design. Numerical results show that the tri-hybrid architecture improves spatial gain and energy efficiency, though with reduced beam alignment capability compared to conventional hybrid beamforming architectures.</description>

      <title>Tensor Reed-Muller Codes: Achieving Capacity with Quasilinear Decoding Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Define the codewords of the Tensor Reed-Muller code $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;r_2,m_2;\dots;r_t,m_t)$ to be the evaluation vectors of all multivariate polynomials in the variables $\left\{x_{ij}\right\}_{i=1,\dots,t}^{j=1,\dots m_i}$ with degree at most $r_i$ in the variables $x_{i1},x_{i2},\dots,x_{im_i}$. The generator matrix of $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dots;r_t,m_t)$ is thus the tensor product of the generator matrices of the Reed-Muller codes $\mathsf{RM}(r_1,m_1),\dots, \mathsf{RM}(r_t,m_t)$.
  We show that for any constant rate $R$ below capacity, one can construct a Tensor Reed-Muller code $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dotsc;r_t,m_t)$ of rate $R$ that is decodable in quasilinear time. For any blocklength $n$, we provide two constructions of such codes:
  1) Our first construction (with $t=3$) has error probability $n^{-\omega(\log n)}$ and decoding time $O(n\log\log n)$.
  2) Our second construction, for any $t\geq 4$, has error probability $2^{-n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2(t-2)}-o(1)}}$ and decoding time $O(n\log n)$.
  One of our main tools is a polynomial-time algorithm for decoding an arbitrary tensor code $C=C_1\otimes\dotsc\otimes C_t$ from $\frac{d_{\min}(C)}{2\max\{d_{\min}(C_1),\dotsc,d_{\min}(C_t) \}}-1$ adversarial errors. Crucially, this algorithm does not require the codes $C_1,\dotsc,C_t$ to themselves be decodable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearly Separable Distributed Computing: A Sparse Tensor Factorization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work considers the $N$-server distributed computing setting with $K$ users requesting functions that are arbitrary multi-variable polynomial evaluations of $L$ real (potentially non-linear) basis subfunctions. Our aim is to seek efficient task-allocation and data-communication techniques that reduce computation and communication costs. Towards this, we take a tensor-theoretic approach, in which we represent the requested non-linearly decomposable functions using a properly designed tensor $\bar{\mathcal{F}}$, whose sparse decomposition into a tensor $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$ and matrix $\mathbf{D}$ directly defines the task assignment, connectivity, and communication patterns. We here design an achievable scheme, employing novel fixed-support SVD-based tensor factorization methods and careful multi-dimensional tiling of subtensors, yielding computation and communication protocols whose costs are derived here, and which are shown to perform substantially better than the state of art.</description>

      <title>Real-Time HAP-Assisted Vehicular Edge Computing for Rural Areas</title>

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are expected to be a key component of 6th generation (6G) networks to support broadband seamless Internet connectivity and expand the coverage even in rural and remote areas. In this context, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) can act as edge servers to process computational tasks offloaded by energy-constrained terrestrial devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and ground vehicles (GVs). In this paper, we analyze the opportunity to support Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) via HAP in a rural scenario where GVs can decide whether to process data onboard or offload them to a HAP. We characterize the system as a set of queues in which computational tasks arrive according to a Poisson arrival process. Then, we assess the optimal VEC offloading factor to maximize the probability of real-time service, given latency and computational capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Ecosystem Competition and Cross-Market Subsidization: A Dynamic Theory of Platform Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platform giants in China have operated with persistently compressed margins in highly concentrated markets for much of the past decade, despite market shares exceeding 60\% in core segments. Standard theory predicts otherwise: either the weaker firm exits, or survivors raise prices to monopoly levels. We argue the puzzle dissolves once firms are viewed as ecosystem optimizers rather than single-market profit maximizers. We develop a dynamic game in which a firm's willingness to subsidize depends on the spillover value its users generate in adjacent markets -- what we call \textit{ecosystem complementarity}. When this complementarity is strong enough, perpetual below-cost pricing emerges as the unique stable equilibrium. The result is not predation in the classical sense; there is no recoupment phase. It is a permanent state of subsidized competition, rational for each firm individually but potentially inefficient in aggregate. We characterize the equilibrium, establish its dynamic stability, and show that welfare losses compound over time as capital flows into subsidy wars rather than innovation. The model's predictions are consistent with observed patterns in Chinese platform markets and suggest that effective antitrust intervention should target cross-market capital flows rather than prices.</description>

      <title>The computational two-way quantum capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities are fundamental to quantum information theory. Their definition, however, does not limit the computational resources of sender and receiver. In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Does 6G Need a New Waveform: Comparing Zak-OTFS with CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.</description>

      <title>On the Nonasymptotic Scaling Guarantee of Hyperparameter Estimation in Inhomogeneous, Weakly-Dependent Complex Network Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models are increasingly used in large, inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems by modeling parameters as draws from a hyperparameter-governed distribution. However, theoretical guarantees for these estimates as the system size grows have been lacking. A critical concern is that hyperparameter estimation may diverge for larger networks, undermining the model's reliability. Formulating the system's evolution in a measure transport perspective, we propose a theoretical framework for estimating hyperparameters with mean-type observations, which are prevalent in many scientific applications. Our primary contribution is a nonasymptotic bound for the deviation of estimate of hyperparameters in inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems with respect to network population size, which is established for a general family of optimization algorithms within a fixed observation duration. While we firstly establish a consistency result for systems with independent nodes, our main result extends this guarantee to the more challenging and realistic setting of weakly-dependent nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on two representative models: a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model and a Spiking Neuronal Network model. In both cases, the results confirm that the estimation error decreases as the network population size increases, aligning with our theoretical guarantees. This research proposes the foundational theory to ensure that hierarchical Bayesian methods are statistically consistent for large-scale inhomogeneous systems, filling a gap in this area of theoretical research and justifying their application in practice.</description>

      <title>Performance Scaling Laws for PD Array-based Receivers in IM/DD Optical Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance scaling laws for electrical-domain combining in photodetector (PD) array-based receivers employing intensity modulation and direct detection, taking into account the inherent square-law relationship between the optical and electrical received powers. The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold. Furthermore, increasing the number of PDs alone does not enhance performance, and joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions is necessary. Our model and derived insights provide practical guidelines and highlight the trade-offs for the design of next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers.</description>

      <title>You May Use the Same Channel Knowledge Map for Environment-Aware NLoS Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) provides an efficient framework to achieve simultaneous wireless sensing and communication. However, traditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS) assumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing transmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex environments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers from signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable environment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel knowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware wireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the same CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS wireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one stone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment (UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the sensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We illustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \emph{channel angle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to derive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship between communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing target localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic geometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Distributed Source Encryption using Mutual Information Security Criterion and the Strong Converse Theorem</title>

Abstract: We reinvestigate the general distributed secure source coding based on the common key cryptosystem proposed by Oohama and Santoso (ITW 2021). They proposed a framework of distributed source encryption and derived the necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission. However, the bounds of the rate region, which specifies both necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission under the proposed cryptosystem, were derived based on a self-tailored non-standard} security criterion. In this paper we adopt the standard security criterion, i.e., standard mutual information. We successfully establish the bounds of the rate region based on this security criterion. Information spectrum method and a variant of Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem play an important role in deriving the result.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Adversarial Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index of the desired message secret from the servers. PIR schemes have been extended to various scenarios with adversarial servers: PIR schemes where some servers are unresponsive or return noisy responses are called robust PIR and Byzantine PIR, respectively; PIR schemes where some servers collude to reveal the index are called colluding PIR. The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies. However, systematic ways to construct PIR schemes that achieve the upper bound are not known. In order to construct a capacity-achieving PIR schemes systematically, it is necessary to clarify the conditions that the queries should satisfy. This paper proves the necessary and sufficient conditions for capacity-achieving PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Codes for Two Bursts of t1-Deletion-t2-Insertion with Low Computational Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Identification capacity and rate-query tradeoffs in classification systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend classical rate-distortion theory to a discrete classification setting with three resources: tag rate $L$ (bits of storage per entity), identification cost $W$ (queries to determine class membership), and distortion $D$ (misidentification probability). We prove an information barrier: when distinct classes share identical attribute profiles (i.e., the attribute-profile map $\pi$ is not injective on classes), zero-error identification from attribute queries alone is impossible. We characterize the unique Pareto-optimal zero-error point in the $(L,W,D)$ tradeoff space: a nominal tag of length $L=\lceil\log_2 k\rceil$ bits for $k$ classes yields $W=O(1)$ and $D=0$. Without tags ($L=0$), zero-error identification requires $W=\Omega(d)$ attribute queries, where $d$ is the distinguishing dimension; in the worst case $d=n$ (the ambient attribute count), giving $W=\Omega(n)$. In the presence of attribute collisions, any tag-free scheme incurs $D&gt;0$. Conversely, in any information-barrier domain, any scheme achieving $D=0$ requires $L\ge \log_2 k$ bits; this is tight. We show minimal sufficient query sets form the bases of a matroid, so the distinguishing dimension is well-defined, connecting to zero-error source coding via graph entropy. We instantiate the theory to type systems, databases, and biological taxonomy. All results are machine-checked in Lean 4 (6000+ lines, 0 sorry).</description>

      <title>On the Exponential Convergence for Offline RLHF with Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with pairwise comparisons proposed by Zhu et al. (2023), where the implicit reward is a linear function of an unknown parameter. Given an offline dataset, our objective consists in ascertaining the optimal action for each state, with the ultimate goal of minimizing the {\em simple regret}. We propose an algorithm, \underline{RL} with \underline{L}ocally \underline{O}ptimal \underline{W}eights or {\sc RL-LOW}, which yields an exponential form of simple regret of $\exp ( - \Omega(n/H) )$ where $n$ is the number of data samples and $H$ denotes an instance-dependent hardness quantity that depends explicitly on the suboptimality gap of each action. Furthermore, we derive a first-of-its-kind instance-dependent lower bound in offline RLHF with pairwise comparisons. Interestingly, we observe that the lower and upper bounds on the simple regret match order-wise in the exponent, demonstrating order-wise optimality of our {\sc RL-LOW}. In view of privacy considerations in practical applications, we also extend {\sc RL-LOW} to the setting of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and show, somewhat surprisingly, that the hardness parameter $H$ is unchanged in the asymptotic regime as $n$ tends to infinity; this underscores the inherent efficiency of {\sc RL-LOW} in terms of preserving the privacy of the observed rewards. Given our focus on establishing instance-dependent bounds of exponential convergence, our research fills the research gap in existing studies that concentrate on establishing worst-case regrets of {\em inverse polynomial convergence} (e.g., $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$) for offline RLHF with pairwise comparisons.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct tight fusion frames with prescribed symmetries. Applying this technique with a prescription for "all the symmetries", we construct a new family of equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames (EITFFs), which consequently form optimal Grassmannian codes. By virtue of their construction, our EITFFs have the remarkable property of total symmetry: any permutation of subspaces can be achieved by an appropriate unitary.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (TN-NTNs), introduced in 5G, is advancing toward a unified and seamless network of networks in Sixth-Generation (6G). This evolution markedly increases the volume of generated and exchanged data, imposing stringent technical and operational requirements along with higher cost and energy consumption. Consequently, efficient management of data generation and transmission within this unified architecture has become essential. In this article, we investigate semantics-aware information handling in unified TN-NTNs, where data communication between distant TN nodes is enabled via an NTN. We consider an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system in which status updates from a remote Energy Harvesting (EH) device are delivered to a destination monitor through a network of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. We leverage semantic metrics, such as Query Version Age of Information, which collectively capture the timeliness, relevance, and utility of information. This approach minimizes the transmission of stale, uninformative, or unusable information, thereby reducing the volume of data that must be transmitted and processed. The result is a substantial reduction in energy consumption and data exchange within the network-achieving up to 73% lower energy-charging requirements and fewer transmission demands than the state of the art-without compromising the conveyed information.</description>

      <title>Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region</title>

Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.</description>
