      <title>Clustering Analysis of US COVID-19 Rates, Vaccine Participation, and Socioeconomic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, with its impact varying significantly across different geographic and socioeconomic contexts. This study employs a clustering analysis to examine the diversity of responses to the pandemic within the United States, aiming to provide nuanced insights into the effectiveness of various strategies. We utilize an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically K-Means clustering, to analyze county-level data that includes variables such as infection rates, death rates, demographic profiles, and socio-economic factors. Our analysis identifies distinct clusters of counties based on their pandemic responses and outcomes, facilitating a detailed examination of "high-performing" and "lower-performing" groups. These classifications are informed by a combination of COVID-specific datasets and broader socio-economic data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to differing levels of pandemic impact. The findings underscore the importance of tailored public health responses that consider local conditions and capabilities. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative visualization tool that aids in hypothesis testing and further research, enhancing the ability of policymakers and public health officials to deploy more effective and targeted interventions in future health crises.</description>

      <title>A splitting, discontinuous Galerkin solver for the cell-by-cell electroneutral Nernst-Planck framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models for excitable tissue with explicit representation of individual cells are highly detailed and can, unlike classical homogenized models, represent complex cellular geometries and local membrane variations. However, these cell-based models are challenging to approximate numerically, partly due to their mixed-dimensional nature with unknowns both in the bulk and at the lower-dimensional cellular membranes. We here develop and evaluate a novel solution strategy for the cell-based KNP-EMI model describing ionic electrodiffusion in and between intra- and extracellular compartments with explicit representation of individual cells. The strategy is based on operator splitting, a multiplier-free formulation of the coupled dynamics across sub-regions, and a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In addition to desirable theoretical properties, such as local mass conservation, the scheme is practical as it requires no specialized functionality in the finite element assembly and order optimal solvers for the resulting linear systems can be realized with black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners. Numerical investigations show that the proposed solution strategy is accurate, robust with respect to discretization parameters, and that the parallel scalability of the solver is close to optimal - both for idealized and realistic two and three dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Code Generation and Performance Engineering for Matrix-Free Finite Element Methods on Hybrid Tetrahedral Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a code generator designed for node-level optimized, extreme-scalable, matrix-free finite element operators on hybrid tetrahedral grids. It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and inter-element vectorization - implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the development, analysis, and generation of efficient loop patterns that leverage the local structure of the underlying tetrahedral grid. These significantly enhance cache locality and arithmetic intensity, mitigating bandwidth-pressure associated with compute-sparse, low-order operators. The paper demonstrates the generator's capabilities through a comprehensive educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators ($-\Delta$, $-\nabla \cdot (k(\mathbf{x})\, \nabla\,)$, $\alpha(\mathbf{x})\, \mathbf{curl}\ \mathbf{curl} + \beta(\mathbf{x}) $), we determine the set of most effective optimizations. Applied by the generator, they result in speed-ups of up to 58$\times$ compared to reference implementations. Detailed node-level performance analysis yields matrix-free operators with a throughput of 1.3 to 2.1 GDoF/s, achieving up to 62% peak performance on a 36-core Intel Ice Lake socket. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion ($ 10^{12}$) degrees of freedom on 21504 processes in less than 50 seconds demonstrates the generated operators' performance and extreme-scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.</description>

      <title>Eulerian Formulation of the Tensor-Based Morphology Equations for Strain-Based Blood Damage Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of blood-handling medical devices, such as ventricular assist devices, requires the analysis of their biocompatibility. Among other aspects, this includes hemolysis, i.e., red blood cell damage. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are employed to predict blood flow in prototypes. The most basic hemolysis models directly estimate red blood cell damage from fluid stress in the resulting flow field. More advanced models explicitly resolve cell deformation. On the downside, these models are typically written in a Lagrangian formulation, i.e., they require pathline tracking. We present a new Eulerian description of cell deformation, enabling the evaluation of the solution across the whole domain. The resulting hemolysis model can be applied to any converged CFD simulation due to one-way coupling with the fluid velocity field. We discuss the efficient numerical treatment of the model equations in a stabilized finite element context. We verify the model by comparison to the original Lagrangian formulation in selected benchmark flows. Two more complex test cases demonstrate the method's capabilities in real-world applications. The results highlight the advantages over previous hemolysis models. In conclusion, the model holds great potential for the design process of future generations of medical devices.</description>
