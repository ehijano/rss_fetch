      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Point potentials on Euclidean space, hyperbolic space and sphere in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dimensions d= 1, 2, 3 the Laplacian can be perturbed by a point potential. In higher dimensions the Laplacian with a point potential cannot be defined as a self-adjoint operator. However, for any dimension there exists a natural family of functions that can be interpreted as Green's functions of the Laplacian with a spherically symmetric point potential. In dimensions 1, 2, 3 they are the integral kernels of the resolvent of well-defined self-adjoint operators. In higher dimensions they are not even integral kernels of bounded operators. Their construction uses the so-called generalized integral, a concept going back to Riesz and Hadamard.
  We consider the Laplace(-Beltrami) operator on the Euclidean space, the hyperbolic space and the sphere in any dimension. We describe the corresponding Green's functions, also perturbed by a point potential. We describe their limit as the scaled hyperbolic space and the scaled sphere approach the Euclidean space. Especially interesting is the behavior of positive eigenvalues of the spherical Laplacian, which undergo a shift proportional to a negative power of the radius of the sphere.
  We expect that in any dimension our constructions yield possible behaviors of the integral kernel of the resolvent of a perturbed Laplacian far from the support of the perturbation. Besides, they can be viewed as toy models illustrating various aspects of renormalization in Quantum Field Theory, especially the point-splitting method and dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Mass Concentration of Two-Spinless Fermi Systems with Attractive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-spinless mass-critical Fermi systems with attractive interactions and trapping potentials. We prove that ground states of the system exist, if and only if the strength $a$ of attractive interactions satisfies $0&lt;a&lt;a_2^*$, where $0&lt;a_2^*&lt;+\infty$ is the best constant of a dual finite-rank Lieb-Thirring inequality. By the blow-up analysis of many-fermion systems, we show that ground states of the system concentrate at the flattest minimum points of the trapping potential $V(x)$ as $a\nearrow a_2^*$.</description>

      <title>Topological Levinson's theorem in presence of embedded thresholds and discontinuities of the scattering matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of discrete Schroedinger operators is investigated through scattering theory. The continuous spectrum of these operators exhibit changes of multiplicity, and some of these operators possess resonances at thresholds. It is shown that the corresponding wave operators belong to an explicitly constructed C*-algebra, whose K-theory is carefully analysed. An index theorem is deduced from these investigations, which corresponds to a topological version of Levinson's theorem in presence of embedded thresholds, resonances, and changes of multiplicity of the scattering matrices. In the second half of the paper, very detailed computations for the simplest realisation of this family of operators are provided. In particular, a surface of resonances is exhibited, probably for the first time. For Levinson's theorem, it is shown that contributions due to resonances at the lowest value and at the highest value of the continuous spectrum play an essential role.</description>

      <title>WKB asymptotics of Stokes matrices, spectral curves and rhombus inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at $z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j- u_{j-1}) \to \infty$ for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line. Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar mechanism applies for $n&gt;3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some simple quivers.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in the Henry problem using the multilevel Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the applicability of the well-known multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to the class of density-driven flow problems, in particular the problem of salinisation of coastal aquifers. As a test case, we solve the uncertain Henry saltwater intrusion problem. Unknown porosity, permeability and recharge parameters are modelled by using random fields. The classical deterministic Henry problem is non-linear and time-dependent, and can easily take several hours of computing time. Uncertain settings require the solution of multiple realisations of the deterministic problem, and the total computational cost increases drastically. Instead of computing of hundreds random realisations, typically the mean value and the variance are computed. The standard methods such as the Monte Carlo or surrogate-based methods is a good choice, but they compute all stochastic realisations on the same, often, very fine mesh. They also do not balance the stochastic and discretisation errors. These facts motivated us to apply the MLMC method. We demonstrate that by solving the Henry problem on multi-level spatial and temporal meshes, the MLMC method reduces the overall computational and storage costs. To reduce the computing cost further, parallelization is performed in both physical and stochastic spaces. To solve each deterministic scenario, we run the parallel multigrid solver ug4 in a black-box fashion.</description>

      <title>Convergence of generalized MIT bag models to Dirac operators with zigzag boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the resolvent convergence of generalized MIT bag operators to Dirac operators with zigzag type boundary conditions. We prove that the convergence holds in strong but not in norm resolvent sense. Moreover, we show that the only obstruction for having norm resolvent convergence is the existence of an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity for the limiting operator. More precisely, we prove the convergence of the resolvents in operator norm once projected into the orthogonal of the corresponding eigenspace.</description>

Abstract: We study the solutions of the local Zamolodhcikov tetrahedron equation in the form of correspondences derived by $3\times 3$ matrices. We present all the associated generators of 4-simplex maps satisfying the local tetrahedron equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that, from some of our solutions, we can recover the 4-simplex extensions of Kashaev--Korepanov--Sergeev and Hirota type tetrahedron maps. Finally, we construct several novel 4-simplex maps.</description>

      <title>A Brief Survey of Fluctuation-induced Interactions in Micro- and Nano-systems and One Exactly Solvable Model as Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations exist in any material object $A$. If $A$ has non-zero temperature $T$, one speaks about thermal fluctuations. If $A$ is at very low $T$, the fluctuations are of quantum origin. Interesting effects appear if two bodies $A$ and $B$ are separated by a fluctuating medium $C$ (say a vacuum, or a fluid close to its {\it critical point}) when the fluctuations are long-ranged, i.e., they decay according to a power-law with the distance. Then the changes of fluctuations in $C$ due to the surfaces and constituents of $A$ are also felt by $B$, and \textit{vice versa}, which leads to a fluctuation induced force (FIF) between them. This force persists in addition to the direct influence of $A$ on $B$ (say, via gravity or Coulomb's force). These FIF's can be of attractive or repulsive character. They may play crucially important role on phenomena involving objects with length scale comparative with the Universe, as well as to the tiny objects relevant for MEMS and NEMS. In the current article we present some basic facts for the FIF and their diversity. Then on the example of one dimensional Ising model with a defect bond we present some new analytical results for such forces.</description>

      <title>Jones polynomials from matrix elements of tangles in a pseudounitary representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes we review the calculation of Jones polynomials using a matrix representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements, rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.</description>

      <title>Exact block encoding of imaginary time evolution with universal quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary-time propagator is implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons (auxiliary qubits) creates the non-unitary action on the visible layer. Then, we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which the hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We prove that this wave function ansatz is closed under the action of the imaginary-time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the ansatz yields the ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can be readily implemented on quantum hardware via mid-circuit measurements of auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and system size, while the width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits linearly proportional to the system size, and circuit depth grows linearly with imaginary time only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $N=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for (4,0) and (3,1) tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>

Abstract: We study higher spin (pure and mixed spin) representations of the Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We provide a geometric realization in terms of the critical cohomology of representations of the quiver with potential of Bykov and Zinn-Justin [BZJ20]. When the framing dimension is 1, it recovers the evaluation pullback of the $\ell+1$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We introduce the lattice model and prove that its partition function coincides with the weight function constructed using the framed shuffle formula. The latter follows the approach of Rim\'anyi, Tarasov and Varchenko [RTV15].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate quantum states with subsets of a product of two compact connected K\"ahler manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$. To associate the quantum state with the subset, we use the map that restricts holomorphic sections of the quantum line bundle over the product of the two K\"ahler manifolds to the subset. We present a description of the kernel of this restriction map when the subset is a finite union of products. This in turn shows that the quantum states associated with the finite union of products are separable. Finally, for every pure state and certain mixed state, we construct subsets of $M_1\times M_2$ such that the states associated with these subsets are the original states, to begin with.</description>

      <title>Massless fermions in black string spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the behaviour of massless fermions in the black string spacetime by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Weyl equations. These solutions allowed us to study the behaviour of such massless fermions in terms of the cosmological constant, the black string's mass and the radial distance of the particle from the black string. The solutions, written in terms of Parabolic Cylinder functions and Laguerre polynomials, were obtained for a particle far from the black string and around the horizon event. For the particle around the event horizon, for all configuration of parameters, the energy eigenvalues are complex-valued, indicating QNM similarly to the case of spherical black holes. For the particle far from the black string, the energies derived from the Weyl equation set up conditions on the parameters in order to keep the energy as a real valued parameter.</description>

      <title>Global asymptotics for $\beta$-Krawtchouk corners processes via multi-level loop equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter family of probability distributions, indexed by $\beta/2 = \theta &gt; 0$ and $K \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, that are called $\beta$-Krawtchouk corners processes. These measures are related to Jack symmetric functions, and can be thought of as integrable discretizations of $\beta$-corners processes from random matrix theory, or alternatively as non-determinantal measures on lozenge tilings of infinite domains. We show that as $K$ tends to infinity the height function of these models concentrates around an explicit limit shape, and prove that its fluctuations are asymptotically described by a pull-back of the Gaussian free field, which agrees with the one for Wigner matrices. The main tools we use to establish our results are certain multi-level loop equations introduced in our earlier work arXiv:2108.07710.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on a submanifold: intermediate formalism versus Hamiltonian reduction of Dirac bracket, and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05151v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$, $[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial 2d higher topological quantum field theory from a local cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct combinatorial analogs of 2d higher topological quantum field theories. We consider triangulations as vertices of a certain CW complex $\Xi$. In the "flip theory," cells of $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ correspond to polygonal decompositions obtained by erasing the edges in a triangulation. These theories assign to a cobordism $\Sigma$ a cochain $Z$ on $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ constructed as a contraction of structure tensors of a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra $V$ assigned to polygons. The cyclic $A_\infty$ equations imply the closedness equation $(\delta+Q)Z=0$. In this context we define combinatorial BV operators and give examples with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the "secondary polytope theory," $\Xi_\mathrm{sp}$ is the secondary polytope (due to Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) and the cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra has to be replaced by an appropriate refinement that we call an $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra. We conjecture the existence of a good Pachner CW complex $\Xi$ for any cobordism, whose local combinatorics is descibed by secondary polytopes and the homotopy type is that of Zwiebach's moduli space of complex structures. Depending on this conjecture, one has an "ideal model" of combinatorial 2d HTQFT determined by a local $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction formulae for spectral traces and Casimir energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short letter considers the case of acoustic scattering by several obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^{d+r}$ for $r,d \geq 1$ of the form $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}^r$, where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a main result a von-Neumann-trace formula for the relative trace is obtained in this setting. As a special case we obtain a dimensional reduction formula for the Casimir energy for the massive and massless scalar fields in this configuration $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}^r$ per unit volume in $\mathbb{R}^r$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Triples on Thermodynamic Formalism and Dixmier Trace Representations of Gibbs: theory and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.01362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study spectral triples and non-commutative expectations associated to expanding and weakly expanding maps. In order to do so, we generalize the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle theorem and obtain a polynomial decay of the operator, which allows to prove differentiability of a dynamically defined $\zeta$-function at its critical parameter. We then generalize Sharp's construction of spectral triples to this setting and provide criteria when the associated spectral metric is non-degenerate and when the non-commutative expectation of the spectral triple is colinear to the integration with respect to the associated equilibrium state from thermodynamic formalism. Due to our general setting, we are able to simultaneously analyse expanding maps on manifolds or connected fractals, subshifts of finite type as well as the Dyson model from statistical physics, which underlines the unifying character of noncommutative geometry. Furthermore, we derive an explicit representation of the $\zeta$-function associated to a particular class of pathological continuous potentials, giving rise to examples where the representation as a non-commutative expectation via the associated zeta function holds, and others where it does not hold.</description>

Abstract: Using the singularity analysis, we investigate the integrability properties and existence of analytic solutions in $f\left( R\right)$-cosmology. Specifically, for some power-law $f\left( R\right) $-theories of particular interest, we apply the ARS algorithm to prove if the field equations possess the Painlev\'{e} property. Constraints for the free parameters of the power-law models are derived, and new analytic solutions are derived, expressed in terms of Laurent expansions.</description>

      <title>Simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group for high-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions (i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group (SRG) as the generalizations of classic approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a high-order propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. The proposed SRG, equipped with a divide-and-conquer framework, can deal with the absence of ergodicity arised from the sparse distribution of high-order interactions and renormalize a system with intertwined high-order interactions on $p$-order according to its properties on $q$-order ($p\leq q$). The associated scaling relation and its corollaries support to differentiate among scale-invariant, weakly scale-invariant, and scale-dependent systems across different orders. We have validated our theory in multi-order scale-invariance verification, topological invariance discovery, organizational structure identification, and information bottleneck analysis to demonstrate its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting systems during system reduction.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of acoustic waves by multiple semi-infinite arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical methods are fundamental in studying acoustics problems. One of the important tools is the Wiener-Hopf method, which can be used to solve many canonical problems with sharp transitions in boundary conditions on a plane/plate. However, there are some strict limitations to its use, usually the boundary conditions need to be imposed on parallel lines (after a suitable mapping). Such mappings exist for wedges with continuous boundaries, but for discrete boundaries, they have not yet been constructed. In our previous article, we have overcome this limitation and studied the diffraction of acoustic waves by a wedge consisting of point scatterers. Here, the problem is generalised to an arbitrary number of periodic semi-infinite arrays with arbitrary orientations. This is done by constructing several coupled systems of equations (one for every semi-infinite array) which are treated independently. The derived systems of equations are solved using the discrete Wiener-Hopf technique and the resulting matrix equation is inverted using elementary matrix arithmetic. Of course, numerically this matrix needs to be truncated, but we are able to do so such that thousands of scatterers on every array are included in the numerical results. Comparisons with other numerical methods are considered, and their strengths/weaknesses are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Deformed Double Current Algebras, Matrix Extended $\mathcal W_{\infty}$ Algebras, Coproducts, and Intertwiners from the M2-M5 Intersection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structures which govern the deformation of supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes. The universal algebras on M2 and M5 branes are deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra respectively. We give a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$, and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra. A new presentation of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.</description>

      <title>Useful variants and perturbations of completely entangled subspaces and spans of unextendible product bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4 (2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)]; Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv: 2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of signed eigenvalue/vector distributions of random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in the large $N$ limit are obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.</description>
