      <title>On study of transition fronts of Fisher-KPP type reaction-diffusion PDEs by non-linear transformations into exactly solvable class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal dynamics of the evolution of population involving growth and diffusion processes can be modeled by class of partial diffusion equations (PDEs) known as reaction-diffusion systems. In this work, we developed a nonlinear transformations method that converts the original nonlinear Fisher-KPP class of PDEs into an exactly solvable class. We then demonstrated that the proposed nonlinear transformation method intrinsically preserves the relaxation behavior of the solutions to asymptotic values of the non-linear dynamical system. We also show that these particular transforms are very amenable to yield an exact closed form solution in terms of the heat kernel and analytical approximations through the two variable Hermite polynomials. With this proposed method, we calculated the front velocity and shape of the propagating wave and showed how the non-linear transformation affects these parameters for both short and long epochs. As applications, we focus on solving pertinent cases of the Fisher-KPP type of PDEs relating to the evolutionary dynamics by assigning fitness to the mutant gene according to zygosity conditions. We calculated the relaxation of velocity with the parameters of the initial conditions in the following cases, namely, the Fisher, the heterozygote inferior fitness, the heterozygote superior fitness, and finally a general nonlinearity case. We also verified previous conjectures through the exact solutions computed using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Mathematical description of continuous time and space replicator-mutator equations for quadratic fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The replicator-mutator equation is a model for populations of individuals carrying different traits, with a fitness function mediating their ability to replicate, and a stochastic model for mutation. We derive analytical solutions for the replicator-mutator equation in continuous time and for continuous traits for a quadratic fitness function. Using these results we can explain and quantify (without the need for numerical in-silico simulations) a series of evolutionary phenomena, in particular the flying kite effect, survival of the flattest, and the ability of a population to sustain itself while tracking an optimal feature which may be fixed, moving with bounded velocity in trait space, oscillating, or randomly fluctuating.</description>
