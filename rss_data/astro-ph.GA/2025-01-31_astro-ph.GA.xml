      <title>A comment on "Why is the Galactic disk so cool?", by Hamilton et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frankel et al (2020) reported that the rate of diffusion in angular momentum by stars in the disk of the Milky Way was about ten times faster than the rate of heating, which places a stringent requirement on the nature of disk star scattering. In a recent posting, Hamilton et al (2024) integrated orbits of test particles in a Galactic model that included transient spirals, and found that the ratio of the rates heating to radial migration in their calculations was generally larger than reported by Frankel et al. They concluded that the observed slow heating rate poses a significant challenge to dynamical models of the Milky Way and seemed to require revision of our current theories of spiral structure. Here we show that that our earlier models of radial migration we published in 2002, after correction for 3D motion, account naturally for the finding of Frankel et al, but leave little room for additional heating by mechanisms other than transient spirals.</description>

      <title>Possible environmental quenching in an interacting LRD pair at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $z\sim7$ group of galaxies that contains two Little Red Dots (LRDs) just 3.3 kpc apart, along with three satellite galaxies, as part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). These LRDs are massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $&gt;1$ mag) whereas the three satellites are lower-mass objects ($M_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show strong evidence for a Balmer Break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free AGN as the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous to interpret, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction may be responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks and PN models to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of the helium content at higher metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are very sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF bright-end cutoff and use it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution by chemisputtering during protostellar formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation, particularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The destruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled primarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach could be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We focused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation, specifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also investigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We modeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal equilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each grain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between the grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered three materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a temporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the evolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of the sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of the gas phase. The application of our method to trajectories where the temperature and density of the gas decrease after the sublimation of a portion of the grain distribution highlights the limitations of current vaporization prescriptions in simulations. The dynamical approach leads to more accurate results for the carbon grain quantity when the temperature and density of the gas evolve quickly. The dynamical approach application to collapse and disk evolution is then foreseen with its integration into hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Circumgalactic Medium Around a Star-Forming Galaxy Driving a Galactic Outflow at $z\approx 0.8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity. Taken together, these observations suggest evidence of a baryon cycle that is recycling the outflowing gas to form the next generation of stars.</description>

      <title>NEATH IV: an early onset of complex organic chemistry in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.</description>

      <title>Into the Mystic: the MUSE view of the ionized gas in the Mystic Mountains in Carina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Mystic Mountains, a dust pillar complex in the center of the Carina Nebula that is heavily irradiated by the nearby young massive cluster Trumpler 14. With the continuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the ionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and ionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901, 902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows despite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission tracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in this highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the Mystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and the corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest remaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have been compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star formation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the role that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of embedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding time is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets, making it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent the type of environment where most stars form.</description>

      <title>An energetic absorption outflow in QSO J1402+2330: Analysis of DESI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Quasar outflows play a significant role in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, impacting the interstellar medium and potentially influencing galaxy evolution. Characterizing these outflows is essential for understanding AGN-driven processes. Aims. We aim to analyze the physical properties of the mini-broad absorption line outflow in quasar J1402+2330 using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We seek to measure the outflows location, energetics, and potential impact on AGN feedback processes. Methods. In the spectrum of J1402+2330, we identify multiple ionic absorption lines, including ground and excited states. We measure the ionic column densities and then use photoionization models to determine the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter of the outflow. We utilized the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state of N iii and S iv to determine the electron number density. Results. The derived electron number density, combined with the ionization parameter, indicates an outflow distance of approximately 2200 pc from the central source. Having a mass outflow rate of more than one thousand solar masses per year and a kinetic energy output exceeding 5 percent of the Eddington luminosity, this outflow can significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the absorption outflow in J1402+2330 plays a potentially significant role in AGN feedback processes. This study highlights the value of DESI data in exploring AGN feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of molecular clouds on galaxy-cloud scale revealed by gravitational network analysis : High-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion or merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations show that molecular gas in spiral galaxies is organized into a network of interconnected systems through the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. Building on this picture, we model molecular gas in the galaxy NGC 628 as a gravitational network, where molecular clouds are represented as nodes. Through analyzing this network, we can characterize both the gravitational interactions and the physical properties of the clouds using geometry-based network metrics. A strong correlation is observed between the geometric and physical properties of the nodes (clouds). High-mass clouds tend to exhibit less clustering and greater average separations, suggesting that they generally have fewer neighbors. During their formation and evolution, high-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion or merging, leading to more isolated characteristics within the network. This aligns with observations showing a decrease in the virial ratio of molecular clouds as their mass increases. For clouds at different evolutionary stages, less evolved clouds with lower mass are typically found in tighter gravitational subnetworks, with closer proximity to neighboring clouds. As a result, they are more prone to accretion or merging during evolution.</description>

      <title>An examination of large-scale galactic effects on molecular cloud properties in NGC 628 : The significant impact of tidal effects from neighboring material on the evolution of molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical factors that influence the development of molecular cloud's density contrast are connected to those that affect star formation in the galaxy. For NGC 628 (M74), the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds initially increases with the distance to the galactic center ($R_{G}$) and then keeps relatively stable. Spiral arms, bubbles and magnetic fields are not responsible for the variations in density contrast observed among molecular clouds. The effects of shear and tides calculated from the galactic rotation curve consistently decrease as $R_{G}$ increases, and the shear effect can be neglected. We further studied the tidal effects of the neighboring material on each cloud using the tidal tensor analysis and the pixel-by-pixel computation, after combining molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar mass surface density maps. When $R_{\rm G} &lt;$ 4 kpc, the tidal strengths derived from the pixel-by-pixel computation decrease as $R_{\rm G}$ increases, and then remains relatively constant when $R_{\rm G} &gt;$ 4 kpc. This aligns well with the dependence of the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds on $R_{\rm G}$. Therefore, the tidal effects of neighboring material have a significant impact on the development of molecular cloud's density contrast. A key factor contributing to the low star formation rate in the galactic center is the excessive tidal influences from neighboring material on molecular clouds, which hinder the gravitational collapse within these clouds, resulting in low density contrasts. The tidal effects from neighboring material may also be a significant contributing factor to the slowing down of a pure free-fall gravitational collapse for gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales revealed in our previous works by velocity gradient measurements.</description>

      <title>Variations of absolute source positions determined from quad-band VLBI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) observed with the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are used as fiducial references on the sky to precisely measure the shape and orientation of the Earth. Their positions form a celestial reference frame that plays an important role in both astronomy and geodesy. This study investigates the accuracy and stability of the positions of the AGNs that are measured by simultaneous VLBI observations at 3.3, 5.5, 6.6, and 10.5 GHz. Based on position time series from dedicated geodetic solutions, we characterize the observed source position variations and identify the possible factors causing such variations. We find that the primary contributor is source structure for sources above 20-degree declination while the sensitivity of the observations to the declination coordinate predominates for sources below 20-degree declination. The position time series are further explored to derive more realistic uncertainties for the quad-band positions. Significant position offsets with respect to the positions at 2.2/8.6 GHz are found for 15% of the sources. For 6% of the sources, the offsets are larger than 0.8 milli-arcseconds. Source structure may be divided into two parts: the invisible structure (within the beam size) and the visible structure (on larger scales). The latter causes closure delays enlarging post-fit delay residuals in geodetic solutions whereas the former causes source position changes. Such position changes will contribute significantly to the offsets between radio and optical positions. Overall, this work highlights the necessity to have a specific quad-band catalog for processing operational quad-band observations.</description>

      <title>The Southern Photometrical Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS): searching for metal-poor dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal content of a galaxy's interstellar medium reflects the interplay between different evolutionary processes such as feedback from massive stars and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. Despite the expected abundance of low-luminosity galaxies, the low-mass and low-metallicity regime remains relatively understudied. Since the properties of their interstellar medium resemble those of early galaxies, identifying such objects in the Local Universe is crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy evolution. We used the DR3 catalog of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) to select low-metallicity dwarf galaxy candidates based on color selection criteria typical of metal-poor, star-forming, low-mass systems. The final sample contains approximately 50 candidates. Spectral energy distribution fitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\sim$ 90\% of the candidates are best fit by models with very low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot sample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find oxygen abundances in the range $7.35&lt;$ 12 + log(O/H) $&lt; 7.93$ (5\% to 17\% of the solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers in the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content relative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical morphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These results suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an external event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the oxygen abundance in these systems.</description>

      <title>Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z &gt; 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity: XI. Pipeline-determined Physical Properties of Magellanic Cloud OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximity &amp; low dust extinction of the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal environment for metal-poor massive stars to be studied in detail. The HST ULLYSES initiative has provided exquisite ultraviolet spectroscopy of a large sample of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, and its legacy value has been enhanced through the acquisition of optical VLT/XShooter spectroscopy (XShootU). We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of 122 LMC &amp; 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are required for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor massive stars. We also aim to identify double-lined binaries and OeBe stars for which analysis requires non-standard treatment. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU spectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC &amp; SMC metallicities. We determine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC &amp; 77 SMC massive stars, ranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB sample (OeBe &amp; candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in agreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses spanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC &amp; 11-74 Msun in the SMC. We determine a revised Teff-spectral type calibration for Magellanic Cloud stars, identify stars with peculiar radial velocities, and compare wind properties of high luminosity O stars with dense winds, revealing ~0.27 dex higher wind momenta of LMC stars with respect to SMC counterparts. Incorporating the recent empirical metallicity dependence of Z^0.22 for wind velocities, this suggests a mass-loss dependence of Z^0.5 for luminous O stars. Studies incorporating ultraviolet mass-loss diagnostics are required for OB stars with weak winds and/or low luminosities.</description>

      <title>CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Measurements of near-IR auto- and cross-power spectra on arcminute to sub-degree scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new anisotropy measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) for angular multipoles $300&lt;\ell&lt;10^5$ using imaging data at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m from the fourth flight of the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER). Using improved analysis methods and higher quality fourth flight data, we detect surface brightness fluctuations on scales $\ell&lt;2000$ with CIBER auto-power spectra at $\sim14\sigma$ and 18$\sigma$ for 1.1 and 1.8 $\mu$m, respectively, and at $\sim10\sigma$ in cross-power spectra. The CIBER measurements pass internal consistency tests and represent a $5-10\times$ improvement in power spectrum sensitivity on several-arcminute scales relative to that of existing studies. Through cross-correlations with tracers of diffuse galactic light (DGL), we determine that scattered DGL contributes $&lt;10\%$ to the observed fluctuation power at high confidence. On scales $\theta &gt; 5'$, the CIBER auto- and cross-power spectra exceed predictions for integrated galactic light (IGL) and integrated stellar light (ISL) by over an order of magnitude, and are inconsistent with our baseline IGL+ISL+DGL model at high significance. We cross-correlate two of the CIBER fields with 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m mosaics from the Spitzer Deep Wide-Field Survey and find similar evidence for departures from Poisson noise in Spitzer-internal power spectra and CIBER $\times$ Spitzer cross-power spectra. A multi-wavelength analysis indicates that the auto-power of the fluctuations at low-$\ell$ is bluer than the Poisson noise from IGL and ISL; however, for $1' &lt;\theta &lt; 10'$, the cross-correlation coefficient $r_{\ell}$ of nearly all band combinations decreases with increasing $\theta$, disfavoring astrophysical explanations that invoke a single correlated sky component.</description>

      <title>Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and a control model that assumes the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_V$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the control model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 41 considered $D_V$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 70.5 for the control void-free model, while the void models give only $44.8 - 46.7$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.0\sigma$ without a void to $1.0\sigma - 1.2\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth, but the void-free model provides the worst fit in all cases. Overall, our results suggest that recent hints of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XIV. New clues on the location of the TAMS in the massive star domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.</description>

      <title>Characterising the multiple protostellar system VLA 1623-2417 with JWST, ALMA and VLA: outflow origins, dust growth and an unsettled disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~&lt;15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~&lt;22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. Complex Dusty Starbursts in a Major Merger B14-65666 at z=7.15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system ($M_\text{UV}=-22.5$ mag) at $z=7.15$. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope ($\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1$). The flux excess, F356W$-$F444W, peaks at the E-core ($1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, $\simeq1$ dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty ($A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1$ mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature ($\ge63$-$68$ K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature ($\le27$-$33$ K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and $\beta_\text{UV}$ diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity ($\simeq0.2$-$0.4$ Z$_{\odot}$) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>The role of shocks and the velocity gradient in the relative orientation of the magnetic field and dense gas clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment mechanism between the magnetic field and interstellar clouds formed by the collision of warm atomic gas. We find that the magnetic field, initially oriented parallel to the flow, is perturbed by a fast MHD shock, which amplifies magnetic field fluctuations parallel to the shock front. Behind the shock, the compressive downstream velocity field further amplifies the magnetic field component parallel to the shock front. This mechanism causes the magnetic field to become increasingly parallel to the dense layer, and the development of a shear flow around the latter. Furthermore, the bending-mode perturbations on the dense layer are amplified by the non-linear thin-shell instability (NTSI), stretching the density structures formed by the thermal instability, and rendering them parallel to the bent field lines. By extension, we suggest that a tidal stretching velocity gradient such as that produced in gas infalling into a self-gravitating structure must straighten the field lines along the accretion flow, orienting them perpendicular to the density structures. We also find that the upstream superalfv\'enic regime transitions to a transalfv\'enic regime between the shock and the condensation front, and then to a subalfv\'enic regime inside the condensations.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at $z &gt; 2.3$, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: A history of galaxy migrations over the Stellar Mass - SFR plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar mass-star formation rate (M$_\star$ - SFR) plane is essential for distinguishing galaxy populations, but how galaxies move within this plane over cosmic time remains unclear. This study aims to describe galaxy migrations in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane by reconstructing star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of galaxies out to redshift $z &lt; 4$. This provides insights into the physical processes driving star formation. We use data from the COSMOS field, selecting 299131 galaxies at $z &lt; 4$ with COSMOS-Web NIRCam data (m$_\mathrm{F444W} &lt; 27$) over 0.54 deg$^2$. Using the SED modeling code CIGALE with non-parametric SFHs, we derive physical properties and migration vectors for these galaxies. These vectors describe the direction and velocity of evolutionary paths across the M$_\star$ - SFR plane. To assess the accuracy of these vectors, we compare them to results from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Galaxies within the main sequence show low migration amplitudes and dispersed movement directions, indicating oscillation within the main sequence. Most progenitors were already on the main sequence a billion years earlier. Starburst galaxies assembled half their mass in the last 350 Myr and originated from the main sequence. Passive galaxies show uniformly declining SFHs and include massive galaxies already in the passive region at $z = 3.5-4$, with increasing density over time. Using reconstructed SFHs up to $z &lt; 4$, we propose a coherent picture of how galaxies migrate over cosmic time in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane, highlighting the connection between major phases in the star-formation history.</description>

Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) serve as fundamental standard candles for measuring cosmic distances and investigating the structure and evolution of the Milky Way disc. However, accurate distance estimation faces challenges due to severe extinction, particularly toward the Galactic center. Although the $Gaia$ Wesenheit magnitude reduces extinction effects, its reliance on a constant optical extinction law introduces significant uncertainties in regions of heavy obscuration. Infrared Period-Luminosity relations, combined with 3D extinction maps, offer an alternative, but these maps become unreliable beyond approximately 5 kpc. In this work, we calibrate the Period-Luminosity-Metallicity (PLZ) relations for DCEPs across three near-infrared bands ($J, H, K_S$) and four mid-infrared bands ($W1, W2, [3.6]$, and $[4.5]$). This includes the first calibration of the $W1$ and $W2$ bands. To correct for extinction, we employ the infrared multi-passband optimal distance method and the BP-RP method, which complement and validate each other. These homogeneous PLZ relations, combined with reliable extinction corrections, yield the most accurate Galactic DCEP distances to date, covering 3,452 DCEPs with an average relative distance error of 3.1%.</description>

Abstract: Scattering events around the center of massive galaxies will occasionally toss a stellar-mass compact object into an orbit around the massive black hole at the center, beginning an extreme mass ratio inspiral. The early stages of such a highly eccentric orbit are not likely to produce detectable gravitational waves, as the source will only be in a suitable frequency band briefly when it is close to periapsis during each long-period orbit. This repeated burst of emission, firmly in the millihertz band, is the gravitational wave peep. While a single peep is not likely to be detectable, if we consider an ensemble of such subthreshold sources, spread across the universe, together they may produce an unresolvable background noise that could obscure sources otherwise detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Previous studies of the extreme mass ratio signal confusion background focused either on parabolic orbits near the massive black hole or events closer to merger. We seek to improve this characterization by implementing numerical kludge waveforms that can calculate highly eccentric orbits with relativistic effects. Our focus is on orbits at the point of capture that are farther away from the massive black hole. Here we present the waveforms and spectra of peeps generated from recent calculations of extreme mass ratio inspirals/bursts capture parameters and discuss how these can be used to estimate the signal confusion noise generated by such events. We demonstrate the effects of changing the orbital parameters on the resulting spectra as well as showing direct comparisons to parabolic orbits and why the gravitational wave ``peep" needs to be studied further. The results of this study will be expanded upon in a further paper that aims to provide an update on the EMRI signal confusion noise problem.</description>

      <title>Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction</title>

Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free</description>
