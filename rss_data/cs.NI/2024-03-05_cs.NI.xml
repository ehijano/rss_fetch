      <title>Structural Resilience and Connectivity of the IPv6 Internet: An AS-level Topology Examination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset informed by IPv6 routing information to provide statistics, degree distribution, joint degree distribution, and clustering analysis of the IPv6 Internet's structure and resilience.The dataset includes 17,232 unique ASes and 10,000 unique IPv6 prefixes. Analysis reveals an interconnected network with an average path length of approximately 3 hops, suggesting a robust and efficient network with potential redundancy and resilience, despite some isolated components. The paper outlines the degree distribution, indicating many peripheral nodes in a sparse network, and a clustering analysis showing a tendency for ASes to form clusters, which is indicative of redundancy and robustness against failures. The connectivity analysis, including path redundancy and reachability, supports the network's resilience.The findings are crucial for network design and strategic planning, particularly as IPv6 adoption increases. The paper emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of network connectivity in the evolving Internet landscape, highlighting the IPv6 Internet's resilience and structured connectivity.</description>

      <title>Yodel: A Layer 3.5 Name-Based Multicast Network Architecture For The Future Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicasting refers to the ability of transmitting data to multiple recipients without data sources needing to provide more than one copy of the data to the network. The network takes responsibility to route and deliver a copy of each data to every intended recipient. Multicasting has the potential to improve the network efficiency and performance (e.g., throughput and latency) through transferring fewer bits in communicating the same data to multiple recipients compared with unicast transmissions, reduce the amount of networking resources needed for communication, lower the network energy footprint, and alleviate the occurrence of congestion in the network. Over the past few decades, providing multicast services has been a real challenge for ISPs, especially to support home users and multi-domain network applications, leading to the emergence of complex application-level solutions. These solutions like Content Delivery and Peer-to-Peer networks take advantage of complex caching, routing, transport, and topology management systems which put heavy strains on the underlying Internet infrastructures to offer multicasting services. In reality, the main motivation behind the design of these systems is rather sharing content than offering efficient multicast services. In this paper, we propound Yodel, a name-based multicast network architecture that can provide multi-domain multicast services for current and future Internet applications. Compared to the wider array of other name-based network architectures with clean-slate infrastructure requirements, Yodel is designed to provide multicast services over the current Internet infrastructure. Hence, Yodel puts forward several design goals that distinguish it from other name-based network architectures with inherent multicast capabilities. This paper is prepared to discuss the Yodel architecture, its design goals, and architectural functions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Simulators for Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Adhoc networks (VANETs) are composed of vehicles connected with wireless links to exchange data. VANETs have become the backbone of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart cities and enable many essential services like roadside safety, traffic management, platooning, etc with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. In any form of research testing and evaluation plays a crucial role. However, in VANETs, real-world experiments require high investment, and heavy resources and can cause many practical difficulties. Therefore, simulations have become critical and the primary way of evaluating VANETs' applications. Furthermore, the upfront challenge is the realistic capture of the networking mechanism of VANETs, which varies from situation to situation. Several factors may contribute to the successful achievement of a random realistic networking behavior. However, the biggest dependency is a powerful tool for the implementation, which could probably take into account all the configuration parameters, loss factors, mobility schemes, and other key features of a VANET, yet give out practical performance metrics with a good trade-off between investment of resources and the results. Hence, the aim of this research is to evaluate some simulators in the scope of VANETs with respect to resource utilization, packet delivery, and computational time.</description>

      <title>Hercules: Heterogeneous Requirements Congestion Control Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's networks are struggling to scale and satisfy the high number and high variety of co-existing network requirements. While existing congestion control (CC) protocols are designed to handle strict classification of network flows into one or few priorities, a more granular and dynamic congestion control is needed.
  In this paper we present Hercules, a novel CC protocol based on an online learning approach, which supports unbounded and continues requirements space. We implemented Hercules as a QUIC module and we show, through analytical analysis and real-world experiments, that it provides between $50\%-250\%$ higher QoS for co-existing diverse network flows and outperforms state-of-the-art CC protocols, even under high network congestion.</description>

      <title>Exploring Upper-6GHz and mmWave in Real-World 5G Networks: A Direct on-Field Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum crunch challenge poses a vital threat to the progress of cellular networks and recently prompted the inclusion of millimeter wave (mmWave) and Upper 6GHz (U6G) in the 3GPP standards. These two bands promise to unlock a large portion of untapped spectrum, but the harsh propagation due to the increased carrier frequency might negatively impact the performance of urban Radio Access Network (RAN) deployments. Within the span of a year, two co-located 5G networks operating in these frequency bands were deployed at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, entirely dedicated to the dense urban performance assessment of the two systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the measurement campaigns conducted on them, with the U6G campaign representing the first of its kind. A benchmark is provided by ray-tracing simulations. The results suggest that networks operating in these frequency bands provide good indoor and outdoor coverage and throughput in urban scenarios, even when deployed in the macro base station setup common to lower frequencies. In addition, a comparative performance analysis of these two key technologies is provided, offering insights on their relative strengths, weaknesses and improvement margins and informing on which bands is better suited for urban macro coverage.</description>

      <title>A Quick Framework for Evaluating Worst Robustness of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness is pivotal for comprehending, designing, optimizing, and rehabilitating networks, with simulation attacks being the prevailing evaluation method. Simulation attacks are often time-consuming or even impractical, however, a more crucial yet persistently overlooked drawback is that any attack strategy merely provides a potential paradigm of disintegration. The key concern is: in the worst-case scenario or facing the most severe attacks, what is the limit of robustness, referred to as ``Worst Robustness'', for a given system? Understanding a system's worst robustness is imperative for grasping its reliability limits, accurately evaluating protective capabilities, and determining associated design and security maintenance costs. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Most Destruction Attack (MDA) based on the idea of knowledge stacking. MDA is employed to assess the worst robustness of networks, followed by the application of an adapted CNN algorithm for rapid worst robustness prediction. We establish the logical validity of MDA and highlight the exceptional performance of the adapted CNN algorithm in predicting the worst robustness across diverse network topologies, encompassing both model and empirical networks.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming landscape of Earth Observation missions will defined by networked heterogeneous nanosatellite constellations required to meet strict mission requirements, such as revisit times and spatial resolution. However, scheduling satellite communications in these satellite networks through efficiently creating a global satellite Contact Plan (CP) is a complex task, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being limited by onboard computational resources. The paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by modeling the constellations and CP as dynamic networks and employing graph-based techniques. The proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural network to evaluate the performance of a given CP and update it using a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. The trained neural network can predict the network delay with a mean absolute error of 3.6 minutes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully design a contact plan for large satellite networks, improving the delay by 29.1%, similar to a traditional approach, while performing the objective evaluations 20x faster.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Feature Learning in Multivariate Big Data Analysis for Network Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.02677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in the development of new data-driven models useful to assess the performance of communication networks. For many applications, like network monitoring and troubleshooting, a data model is of little use if it cannot be interpreted by a human operator. In this paper, we present an extension of the Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA) methodology, a recently proposed interpretable data analysis tool. In this extension, we propose a solution to the automatic derivation of features, a cornerstone step for the application of MBDA when the amount of data is massive. The resulting network monitoring approach allows us to detect and diagnose disparate network anomalies, with a data-analysis workflow that combines the advantages of interpretable and interactive models with the power of parallel processing. We apply the extended MBDA to two case studies: UGR'16, a benchmark flow-based real-traffic dataset for anomaly detection, and Dartmouth'18, the longest and largest Wi-Fi trace known to date.</description>

      <title>Big AI Models for 6G Wireless Networks: Opportunities, Challenges, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) represented by chatGPT have brought an incredible revolution. With the pre-trained BAIMs in certain fields, numerous downstream tasks can be accomplished with only few-shot or even zero-shot learning and exhibit state-of-the-art performances. As widely envisioned, the big AI models are to rapidly penetrate into major intelligent services and applications, and are able to run at low unit cost and high flexibility. In 6G wireless networks, to fully enable intelligent communication, sensing and computing, apart from providing other intelligent wireless services and applications, it is of vital importance to design and deploy certain wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs). However, there still lacks investigation on architecture design and system evaluation for wBAIM. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive discussion as well as some in-depth prospects on the demand, design and deployment aspects of the wBAIM. We opine that wBAIM will be a recipe of the 6G wireless networks to build high-efficient, sustainable, versatile, and extensible wireless intelligence for numerous promising visions. Then, we provide the core characteristics, principles, and pilot studies to guide the design of wBAIMs, and discuss the key aspects of developing wBAIMs through identifying the differences between the existing BAIMs and the emerging wBAIMs. Finally, related research directions and potential solutions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Edge Caching Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the escalating challenge of redundant data transmission in networks. The surge in traffic has strained backhaul links and backbone networks, prompting the exploration of caching solutions at the edge router. Existing work primarily relies on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for caching issues, assuming fixed-time interval decisions; however, real-world scenarios involve random request arrivals, and despite the critical role of various file characteristics in determining an optimal caching policy, none of the related existing work considers all these file characteristics in forming a caching policy. In this paper, first, we formulate the caching problem using a semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to accommodate the continuous-time nature of real-world scenarios allowing for caching decisions at random times upon file requests. Then, we propose a double deep Q-learning-based caching approach that comprehensively accounts for file features such as lifetime, size, and importance. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based method. Furthermore, we extend our work to include a Transfer Learning (TL) approach to account for changes in file request rates in the SMDP framework. The proposed TL approach exhibits fast convergence, even in scenarios with increased differences in request rates between source and target domains, presenting a promising solution to the dynamic challenges of caching in real-world environments.</description>
