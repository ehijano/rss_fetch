      <title>PlayMolecule pKAce: Small Molecule Protonation through Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecule protonation is an important part of the preparation of small molecules for many types of computational chemistry protocols. For this, a correct estimation of the pKa values of the protonation sites of molecules is required. In this work, we present pKAce, a new web application for the prediction of micro-pKa values of the molecules' protonation sites. We adapt the state-of-the-art, equivariant, TensorNet model originally developed for quantum mechanics energy and force predictions to the prediction of micro-pKa values. We show that an adapted version of this model can achieve state-of-the-art performance comparable with established models while trained on just a fraction of their training data.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Homeostasis in Mass-Action Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-Modal and Multi-Attribute Single-Cell Counts with CFGen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data has shown invaluable potential in community-driven tasks such as trajectory inference, batch effect removal and gene expression generation. However, most recent deep models generating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, ignoring the inherently discrete and over-dispersed nature of single-cell data, which limits downstream applications and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Moreover, crucial aspects of deep-learning-based synthetic single-cell generation remain underexplored, such as controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation and its role in the performance enhancement of downstream tasks. This work presents Cell Flow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model for multi-modal single-cell counts, which explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of the data. Our results suggest improved recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while accounting for novel generative tasks such as conditioning on multiple attributes and boosting rare cell type classification via data augmentation. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing MRI Data Processing Using FSL: Preliminary Findings with the Fugaku Supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of Magnetic resonance imaging data has grown tremendously recently, creating an urgent need to accelerate data processing, which requires substantial computational resources and time. In this preliminary study, we applied FMRIB Software Library commands on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images of a single young adult using the Fugaku supercomputer. The tensor-based measurements and subcortical structure segmentations performed on Fugaku supercomputer were highly consistent with those from conventional systems, demonstrating its reliability and significantly reduced processing time.</description>

      <title>DFDRNN: A dual-feature based neural network for drug repositioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug repositioning is an economically efficient strategy used to discover new indications for existing drugs beyond their original approvals, expanding their applicability and usage to address challenges in disease treatment. In recent years, deep-learning techniques for drug repositioning have gained much attention. While most deep learning-based research methods focus on encoding drugs and diseases by extracting feature information from neighbors in the network, they often pay little attention to the potential relationships between the features of drugs and diseases, leading to imprecise encoding of drugs and diseases. To address this, we design a dual-feature drug repositioning neural network (DFDRNN) model to achieve precise encoding of drugs and diseases. DFDRNN uses two features to represent drugs and diseases: the similarity feature and the association feature. The model incorporates a self-attention mechanism to design two dual-feature extraction modules for achieving precisely encoding of drugs and diseases: the intra-domain dual-feature extraction (IntraDDFE) module and the inter-domain dual-feature extraction (InterDDFE) module. The IntraDDFE module extracts features from a single domain (drug or disease domain), while the InterDDFE module extracts features from the mixed domain (drug and disease domain). In particular, the feature is changed by InterDDFE, ensuring a precise encoding of drugs and diseases. Finally, a cross-dual-domain decoder is designed to predict drug-disease associations in both the drug and disease domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art methods, DFDRNN outperforms others on four benchmark datasets, with an average AUROC of 0.946 and an average AUPR of 0.597.</description>
