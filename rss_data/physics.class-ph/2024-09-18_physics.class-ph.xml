      <title>A Unifying Action Principle for Classical Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern theory of classical mechanics, developed by Lagrange, Hamilton and Noether, attempts to cast all of classical motion in the form of an optimization problem, based on an energy functional called the classical action. The most important advantage of this formalism is the ability to manifestly incorporate and exploit symmetries and conservation laws. This reformulation succeeded for unconstrained and holonomic systems that at most obey position equality constraints. Non-holonomic systems, which obey velocity dependent constraints or position inequality constraints, are abundant in nature and of central relevance for science, engineering and industry. All attempts so far to solve non-holonomic dynamics as a classical action optimization problem have failed. Here we utilize the classical limit of a quantum field theory action principle to construct a novel classical action for non-holonomic systems. We therefore put to rest the 190 year old question of whether classical mechanics is variational, answering in the affirmative. We illustrate and validate our approach by solving three canonical model problems by direct numerical optimization of our new action. The formalism developed in this work significantly extends the reach of action principles to a large class of relevant mechanical systems, opening new avenues for their analysis and control both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Explicit form for the most general Lorentz transformation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12969v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit formulae for the $4\times 4$ Lorentz transformation matrices corresponding to a pure boost and a pure three-dimensional rotation are very well-known. Significantly less well-known is the explicit formula for a general Lorentz transformation with arbitrary nonzero boost and rotation parameters. We revisit this more general formula by presenting two different derivations. The first derivation (which is somewhat simpler than previous ones appearing in the literature) evaluates the exponential of a $4\times 4$ real matrix $A$, where $A$ is a product of the diagonal matrix ${\rm diag}(+1, -1, -1, -1)$ and an arbitrary $4\times 4$ real antisymmetric matrix. The formula for $\exp A$ depends only on the eigenvalues of $A$ and makes use of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. The second derivation exploits the observation that the spinor product $\eta^\dagger\overline{\sigma}^{\lower3pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle \mu$}}\chi$ transforms as a Lorentz four-vector, where $\chi$ and $\eta$ are two-component spinors. The advantage of the latter derivation is that the corresponding formula for a general Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ reduces to the computation of the trace of a product of $2\times 2$ matrices. Both computations are shown to yield equivalent expressions for $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Laser Pulse Induced Second- and Third-Harmonic Generation of Gold Nanorods with Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Tight Binding (RT-TDDFTB) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate second- and third-harmonic generation processes in Au nanorod systems using the real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding method. Our study focuses on the computation of nonlinear signals based on the time dependent dipole response induced by linearly polarized laser pulses interacting with nanoparticles. We systematically explore the influence of various laser parameters, including pump intensity, duration, frequency, and polarization directions, on harmonic generation. We demonstrate all the results using Au nanorod dimer systems arranged in end-to-end configurations, and disrupting the spatial symmetry of regular single nanorod systems is crucial for second-harmonic generation processes. Furthermore, we study the impact of nanorod lengths, which lead to variable plasmon energies, on harmonic generation, and estimates of polarizabilities and hyper-polarizabilities are provided.</description>
