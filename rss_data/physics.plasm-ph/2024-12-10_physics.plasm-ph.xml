      <title>Spatially modulated plasma profile for turbulence and instabilities mitigation in fusion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores a novel approach to mitigating turbulence in fusion plasmas through spatially modulated plasma profiles. By imposing a harmonic modulation on plasma parameters, we introduce conditions that alter the propagation characteristics of turbulent and MHD waves, a primary source of transport and instabilities in fusion devices. This modulation approach resembles bandgap formation in solid-state and photonic crystals, where spatial periodicity suppresses wave propagation within specific frequency bands. The mathematical framework developed here essentially resembles the parametric resonance of the harmonic oscillator. It reveals how a controlled spatial variation of turbulent wave phase velocity can effectively attenuate turbulence and instabilities. Several methods for implementing this modulation in plasma, including RF waves, static magnetic field perturbations, and modulated density profiles, are proposed as potential paths for achieving stable confinement. This concept could provide a versatile and potentially more controllable alternative to existing turbulence suppression techniques, with the goal of improving stability and confinement across a variety of magnetized fusion configurations.</description>

      <title>Detection of Surface Waves During Femtosecond Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed lasers (USPL) can produce thin columns of plasma in air via femtosecond filamentation, and these plasmas have been found to generate broadband TeraHertz (THz) and Radio Frequency (RF) radiation. A recent theory argues that the currents driven at the boundary of the plasma excite a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) surface wave (in particular a Sommerfeld-Goubau wave given the cylindrical symmetry), which proceeds to detach from the end of the plasma to become the RF pulse. We have performed near-field measurements of these plasmas with a D-dot probe, and find an excellent agreement with this theory. The radial field dependence is precisely fit by a Hankel function, with an outer length scale in agreement with plasma conductivity and radius, and a measured longitudinal drift in frequency maxima closely matches both SPP simulations and analytic expectations.</description>

      <title>High Order Free Boundary MHD Equilibria in DESC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the free boundary inverse equilibrium problem for 3D ideal MHD. We review boundary conditions for both fixed and free boundary solutions and under what circumstances a sheet current may exist at the plasma-vacuum interface. We develop an efficient and accurate algorithm for computing the residual of these boundary conditions and use it to compute free boundary equilibria in the DESC code both in vacuum and at finite plasma beta, with and without sheet currents.</description>

      <title>Energy Spectrum of Lost Alpha Particles in Magnetic Mirror Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a magnetic mirror fusion reactor, capturing the energy of fusion-produced alpha particles is essential to sustaining the reaction. However, since alpha particles are born at energies much higher than the confining potential, a substantial fraction are lost due to pitch-angle scattering before they can transfer their energy to the plasma via drag. The energy of prematurely lost alpha particles can still be captured through direct conversion, but designing an effective mechanism requires a description of the energies and times at which they become deconfined. Here we present the first-ever analytical solutions for the loss velocity, energy, and time distributions of alpha particles in a magnetic mirror. After obtaining the Fokker-Planck model of the Landau collision operator, we asymptotically solve for the orthogonal eigenfunctions of the Legendre operator with homogeneous boundary conditions to reveal an easily interpretable closed-form solution. Our framework is extremely general and can in principle be applied to any high-energy species, subject to any applied potential, in the low collisionality, modest potential regime for any mirror ratio R &gt; 1, making this work broadly applicable to existing mirror devices.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of two magnetized counter-propagating weakly collisional plasma flows in arch configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of the interaction process of two counter-streaming supersonic plasma flows with an arched magnetic field configuration in the regime of a magnetic Mach number of the order of unity $M_m \sim 1$ is carried out. The flows were launched from the bases of the arch along the direction of the magnetic field. It is shown that the interaction has non-equilibrium and non-stationary nature. It is accompanied by an expansion of the resulting magnetic plasma arch due to $E \times B$ drift with the formation of a region with oppositely directed magnetic fields, in which magnetic reconnection is observed. In the subcritical regime Mm &lt; 1 the reconnection process is slow, and in the overcritical one Mm &gt; 1 it is more intense and leads to plasma turbulization. Filamentation of flows due to the development of Weibel instability, as well as excitation of surface waves near the ion-cyclotron frequency on the surface of the plasma tube are also observed. The modeling was carried out for the parameters of an experiment planned for the near future, which made it possible to formulate the conditions for observing the effects discovered in the modeling.</description>

      <title>Alfven pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfven pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. Using perturbation theory and the solution found for the case of a homogeneous in a cross section magnetic tube, the electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfven wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e. accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined. For the chromospheric footpoints of the magnetic loops, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decay, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>The electron cyclotron maser instability in laser-ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that circularly polarized lasers create plasmas with long-lasting ring-shaped weakly relativistic momentum distributions which, in the presence of an ambient magnetic field, are prone to the electron cyclotron maser instability. Theoretical results and particle-in-cell simulations show that current laser technology can effectively induce field ionized tailored distribution functions and probe the electron cyclotron maser in controlled conditions, providing direct experimental evidence to coherent radiation processes driven by ring-shaped or Landau inverted momentum distributions of relevance in extreme astrophysical conditions.</description>

      <title>Electron-impact ionization of Si IV-VIII relevant for inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ionization of silicon by electron impacts in hot plasmas. Our calculations of the cross sections and rates rely on the Coulomb-Born-Exchange, Binary-Encounter-Dipole and Distorted-Wave methods implemented in the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC), and are compared with measurements and other theoretical values. We use a semi-empirical formula for the cross section, which involves a small set of adjustable parameters. Configuration interaction is taken into account and is shown to affect the cross section at low energy, in particular for Si$^{3+}$. The rate coefficient is then expressed in terms of these parameters and is represented in a large temperature interval, up to 10$^8$ K. As expected, the agreement with measurements improves for increasing ion charges, confirming the applicability of our approach to hot plasma studies such as inertial-confinement fusion, and its reliability.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Filamentation-Assisted Isolated Attosecond Pulse Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) generated by few-cycle femtosecond lasers are essential for capturing ultrafast dynamics in atoms, molecules, and solids. Nonetheless, the advancement of attosecond science critically depends on achieving stable, high-temporal-contrast IAPs. Our study reveals a universal scenario in which self-compression of the infrared driver in high harmonic generation in extended gas media leads to high-contrast high-frequency IAP generation. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that filamentation in a semi-infinite gas cell not only shapes the infrared driving pulse spatially and temporally, but also creates a stable propagation region where high harmonic generation is phase-matched, leading to the production of bright IAPs. In an argon-filled gas cell, filamentation notably reduces the pulse duration of Yb-based 1030 nm pulses from 4.7 fs to 3.5 fs, while simultaneously generating high-contrast 200-attosecond IAPs at 70 eV. We demonstrate the universality of filamentation-assisted IAP generation, showing that post-compressed Yb-based laser filaments in neon and helium yield even shorter IAPs: 69-attoseconds at 100 eV, and 65-attoseconds IAPs at 135 eV, respectively. This spatiotemporal reshaping of few-cycle pulses through filamentation possesses immediate impacts on both post-compression techniques and attosecond-based technologies.</description>

      <title>A split-step Active Flux method for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Flux is a modified Finite Volume method that evolves additional Degrees of Freedom for each cell that are located on the interface by a non-conservative method to compute high-order approximations to the numerical fluxes through the respective interface to evolve the cell-average in a conservative way. In this paper, we apply the method to the Vlasov-Poisson system describing the time evolution of the time-dependent distribution function of a collisionless plasma. In particular, we consider the evaluation of the flux integrals in higher dimensions. We propose a dimensional splitting and three types of formulations of the flux integral: a one-dimensional reconstruction of second order, a third-order reconstruction based on information along each dimension, and a third-order reconstruction based on a discrepancy formulation of the Active Flux method. Numerical results in 1D1V phase-space compare the properties of the various methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of radiating particles in current sheets with a transverse magnetic field component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming multipetawatt laser facilities are capable of inducing effects of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in laser-plasma interaction such as strong radiation reaction and QED cascades, both of which can significantly influence the properties and dynamics of laser plasma. This can result in the formation of extreme plasma structures with unprecedented TG levels of quasistatic magnetic fields, for example current sheets or pinch configurations of nanometer scale or smaller. In such structures radiation losses can play a significant role, so the influence of radiation losses onto the evolution of extreme current sheets deserves a separate and thorough investigation. In the current work we develop an analytical model and extend the quasiadiabatic approach describing individual particle motion onto 3D particle motion in the case when radiation reaction is non-negligible. Given that particle motion is determined by (quasi)invariants of non-dissipative motion, we derive how these (quasi)invariants evolve under the influence of radiation losses, quantify this influence and obtain a (quasi)invariant of dissipative motion. This allows reducing the dimensionality of the system of differential equations describing particle motion to just two instead of six. It is also discussed how the presented method can be used in a wider range of problems.</description>

      <title>Turbulent multicomponent magnetopause: Analytical description and kinetic simulation of complex distributed current sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out particle-in-cell simulations of complex multicomponent current sheets of the family of analytically found Vlasov--Maxwell equilibria that model a collisionless magnetopause and allow for the arbitrary energy distributions and counter currents of various particle fractions. We find that, depending on the parameters, i) a weak small-scale bending-type instability is always present at the sharp low-density plasma boundary of such a magnetopause, and ii) the development of a small-scale Weibel-type instability inside a magnetopause is either excluded or possible. Both cases are studied and compared for two variants of the particle energy distribution~ -- Maxwellian and Kappa. The long-term stability of the whole current sheet is observed either without or with saturated Weibel-type turbulence, which can be generated in a low-magnetized region between neighboring counter currents. We point out the applicability of the developed model of distributed current sheets and the results of analysis of their small-scale instability for the description of physical phenomena in the magnetopauses of planets and late-type stars.</description>

      <title>TORAX: A Fast and Differentiable Tokamak Transport Simulator in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TORAX, a new, open-source, differentiable tokamak core transport simulator implemented in Python using the JAX framework. TORAX solves the coupled equations for ion heat transport, electron heat transport, particle transport, and current diffusion, incorporating modular physics-based and ML models. JAX's just-in-time compilation ensures fast runtimes, while its automatic differentiation capability enables gradient-based optimization workflows and simplifies the use of Jacobian-based PDE solvers. Coupling to ML-surrogates of physics models is greatly facilitated by JAX's intrinsic support for neural network development and inference. TORAX is verified against the established RAPTOR code, demonstrating agreement in simulated plasma profiles. TORAX provides a powerful and versatile tool for accelerating research in tokamak scenario modeling, pulse design, and control.</description>

Abstract: An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.</description>

      <title>Verification of Fast Ion Effects on Turbulence through Comparison of GENE and CGYRO with L-mode Plasmas in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a cross-verification of fast ion effects on turbulence through a systematic comparison of two leading gyrokinetic codes, GENE [F. Jenko et al., Phys. Plasmas 7 1904-1910 (2000)] and CGYRO [J. Candy et al, J. Comput. Phys. 324 73-93 (2016)], using L-mode plasma profiles from KSTAR for local linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations. The focus is on the impact of fast ions and rotation effects on energy flux, aiming to identify the similarities and differences between these codes in the context of turbulence transport research. The analysis shows consistency in linear stability results, fractional changes in energy flux, changes in the distribution of energy fluxes, fluctuations and phase angle with fast ions, and zonal shearing between the codes. However, discrepancies arise in absolute thermal energy levels and rotation effects on energy transport, especially in the presence of fast ions. The study underscores the critical importance of phase angle analysis in gyrokinetic code verification, particularly when assessing fast ion effects on turbulence. Additionally, it highlights the need to examine quantities at lower levels of the primacy hierarchy, as discrepancies at lower levels can lead to divergent results at higher levels. These findings indicate the necessity for further investigation into these discrepancies and the novel phase angle structures observed, contributing to the advancement of accurate transport predictions in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid models (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD in the limit of cold plasma, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>

      <title>Strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against two-dimensional interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that, even within this restricted class of dynamics, the linear stability of an equilibrium does not guarantee its nonlinear stability: equilibria can be metastable. We show that the minimum-energy state accessible to a metastable equilibrium under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be found by solving a combinatorial optimisation problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by our simulations of destabilised metastable equilibria for which turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. To predict the result of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximisation of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of collisionless stellar systems and plasma, and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spin-caloric resistance of Dirac plasma in a graphene Corbino device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal resistance. Practical calculations are then presented for graphene devices in the Corbino geometry.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). At present, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance of an electron beam in a planar storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. Based on indepth investigation of related beam physics, a solution of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The work in this paper, such as the generalized Courant-Snyder formalism, the analysis of theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, and the derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths for laser-induced microbunching schemes, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB but also for future accelerator light sources in general that demand increasingly precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>
