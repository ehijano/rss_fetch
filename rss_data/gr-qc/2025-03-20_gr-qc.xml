      <title>Non-Gaussianities as a Signature of Quantumness of Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the consistent application of the rules of quantum mechanics to cosmological systems inevitably results in the so-called multiverse states in which neither the background spacetime nor the inhomogeneous perturbation are in definite states. We study the multiverse states as perturbations to the usually employed so-called Born-Oppenheimer states that are products of a wave function of the background and a wave function of the perturbation. The obtained corrections involve integrals over \emph{virtual backgrounds} that represent the effect of quantum background fluctuations on the perturbation state. They resemble loop corrections in quantum field theory. This approach demonstrates the inevitable existence of very specific non-Gaussian features in primordial fluctuations. We express the resulting non-Gaussian perturbation as a nonlinear function of the Gaussian perturbation obtained within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and compute its trispectrum, to show that the multiverse scenario leads to testable and distinct signatures in cosmological perturbations. Our approach applies both to inflationary and alternative cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body modeling for generic compact binaries with arbitrary orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first unified model for the general relativistic dynamics and gravitational radiation of generic compact binaries. TEOBResumS-Dal\'i is a model based on the effective-one-body framework incorporating tidal interactions, generic spins, multipolar radiation reaction/waveform and numerical-relativity information. It allows the computation of gravitational waves and other dynamical gauge invariants from generic binaries (black holes, neutron stars, neutron star-black hole binaries) evolving along arbitrary orbits (quasi-circular, eccentric, non-planar) through merger and including scattering. The performances of TEOBResumS-Dal\'i in the strong-field regime are showcased by comparisons with a large sample of 1395 high-accuracy numerical-relativity simulations available. TEOBResumS-Dal\'i allows the computation of faithful waveforms for gravitational wave astronomy, providing at the same time an understanding and a prediction of the strong-field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation in binary neutron star inspiral : Bias study and modeling of frequency domain phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the inspiral of a binary neutron star, viscous processes in the neutron star matter can damp out the tidal energy induced by its companion and convert it to thermal energy. This tidal dissipation/heating process introduces a net phase shift in the gravitational wave signal. In our recent work (Ghosh et al., Phys. Rev. D 109, 103036 (2024)), we showed that tidal dissipation from bulk viscosity originating from the non-leptonic weak interactions involving hyperons could have a detectable phase shift in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal in the next-generation GW detectors. In this work, we model the dephasing due to tidal dissipation in a post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and incorporate this in gravitational waveforms for equal mass binary neutron stars. We then estimate the systematic bias incurred in tidal deformability measurements in simulated signal injection studies when this physical effect is not accounted for in waveform models. Lastly, we perform a full Bayesian parameter estimation with our model to show how accurately we can measure the additional phase due to tidal dissipation in future GW observations and discuss its significance in extreme matter studies.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode of modified cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model where the Standard Model is added to the Einstein Lagrangian together with a Jordan-Brans-Dicke(JBD) coupling.
  The time-dependent Higgs field has an important role in interpreting the effective gravitational constant, $G_{eff}$. This may lead to two Big Bangs, the first Big Bang characterizes the size of the universe being zero. At this Big Bang, the value of the effective gravitational constant is zero and starts decreasing in time through negative values. During this era, the JBD term is important. In the second Big Bang, the effective gravitational constant passes through infinity to positive values. The negative gravitational constant is interpreted as repulsive gravity. The Lagrangian density provides effective potentials leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking which gives cosmological expectation value of the Higgs field and the Higgs mass which depends on curvature and the Brans Dicke parameter.</description>

      <title>Orbits of photon in Bardeen-boson stars and their frozen states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study [1], the Bardeen-boson star (BBS) model involving a scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity and a Bardeen's nonlinear electromagnetic field was investigated. It was found that when the magnetic charge $q$ of the electromagnetic field exceeds a certain critical value $q_c$, a frozen Bardeen-boson star (FBBS) can be obtained with the frequency approaching zero. In this paper, we study the null orbits in the background of the general BBS and FBBS. We find that similar to the boson star (BS), all BBSs do not have the event horizon and possess complete null geodesics, allowing photons to move throughout the entire spacetime of BBS. Among these BBSs, the FBBSs whose spacetime is very similar to that of black holes are particularly special. The null orbits around the FBBSs exhibit sharp deflections near the critical horizon while becoming nearly straight inside the critical horizon. Furthermore, the photon in the background of FBBSs moves for a very long time inside the critical horizon from the perspective of an infinity viewer.</description>

      <title>Gregory-Laflamme-type instability of boson strings and related phases in D=5 Kaluza-Klein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add an $S^1$ extra dimension (size $L$) to the well known $D=4$ static, spherically symmetric $Q$-balls and boson stars. We show that the resulting uniform horizonless boson strings possess a static zero-mode for a critical value of $L$. This is at the threshold of a Gregory-Laflamme instability of these objects, occurring for larger values of $L$.The non-linear continuation of the zero-mode yields $D=5$ non-uniform boson strings. In addition, there are also intrinsic $D=5$ solutions describing localized boson stars on the $S^1$, supported by the contribution of the scalar field Kaluza-Klein modes. Basic properties of all three types of aforementioned solutions are discussed, together with their phase space.</description>

      <title>Covariant effective spacetimes of spherically symmetric electro-vacuum with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic framework was introduced in our previous works to address the covariance issue in spherically symmetric effective quantum gravity. This paper extends the framework to the electro-vacuum case with a cosmological constant. After analyzing the notion of covariance in the classical theory, we propose an effective Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field. The effective Hamiltonian together with the effective Hamiltonian constraint of gravity determines an effective dynamical model of gravity coupled to electromagnetic. The resulting model is covariant with respect to both the effective metric and the effective vector potential. By solving the equations of motion derived from the effective Hamiltonian constraint, we obtain several quantum-corrected solutions. Notably, some of these solutions reveal quantum gravity effects manifesting not only in spacetime metrics but also in the electromagnetic field. Finally, the covariance of coupling models with general matter fields is discussed.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Quasinormal Modes and the Violation of Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Schwarzschild black hole under a noncommutative (NC) deformation of spacetime, constructed via a Drinfeld twist formalism. In this approach, the usual Regge--Wheeler (axial) and Zerilli (polar) equations acquire additional contributions that depend on the NC parameter. Employing semi-analytical approximations (high-order WKB, P\"oschl--Teller and Rosen--Morse), we calculate the corresponding QNM spectra. Our results show that whereas the commutative case preserves the isospectrality of axial and polar modes, noncommutativity systematically violates this degeneracy. The discrepancy grows with the strength of the NC parameter, becoming evident through distinct real and imaginary parts in the ringdown frequencies. These findings highlight the potential of black hole QNMs to serve as probes of quantum-spacetime corrections in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Rotating scalarized black holes: the role of the coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth analysis of rotating scalarized black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where scalarization is induced by the spacetime curvature. Our results show that even for very large spins, the scalar charge can reach values comparable to those in the static limit, meaning it is not significantly suppressed. Consequently, curvature-induced scalarization can lead to non-GR signatures of similar magnitude in both static and rapidly rotating cases. For certain coupling parameters, these scalarized black hole solutions remain within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, where the theory has well-posed formulations.</description>

      <title>QNMs of charged black holes in AdS spacetime: a geometrical optics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of the Reissner$-$Nordstr\"om anti$-$de Sitter black hole using the Penrose limit, motivated by the geometrical optics approximation. This approach offers a novel framework for approximating quasinormal modes with large real frequencies by associating a plane wave to spacetime regions near null geodesics, providing a geometric interpretation of the geometrical optics approximation. Applying this limit to bound null orbits around black holes allows us to explore the black hole response to perturbations. We analyze the effects of black hole charge and negative cosmological constant on the quasinormal spectrum, finding that increasing charge enhances both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, while a decreasing cosmological constant leads to higher real frequencies and longer lived perturbations, with the spectrum stabilizing at larger values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Creation of a FRW Universe: applying the Riesz fractional derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply fractional calculus to study quantum cosmology. Specifically, our Wheeler-DeWitt equation includes a FRW geometry, a radiation fluid, a positive cosmological constant, and an ad hoc potential; we employ the Riesz fractional derivative, which brings a parameter $\alpha$, where $1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$, appearing explicitly in the mentioned equation. We investigate numerically the tunnelling probability for the Universe to emerge using a suitable WKB approximation. Our findings are as follows. When we decrease the value for $\alpha$, the tunnelling probability also decreases, suggesting that if fractional features could be considered to ascertain among different early universe scenarios, then the value $\alpha=2$ (meaning strict locality and standard cosmology) would be the most likely. Finally, our results also allow for an interesting discussion between selecting values for $\Lambda$ (in a non-fractional conventional set-up) versus balancing, e.g., both $\Lambda$ and $\alpha$ in the fractional framework. Concretely, the probability transition in the former if, e.g., $\Lambda=0.7$, is very close to the value computed if in the latter we employ instead, e.g., $\Lambda=1.5$ and $\alpha=1.9397961$.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention to establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Primordial Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presented in this thesis draws back the curtain on the physics of the primordial universe by leveraging Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as cosmological probes. The violent deaths of ultralight PBHs are shown to severely inhibit leptogenesis, alter the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and provide an opportunity to rule out models of leptogenesis which would otherwise evade direct detection experiments for effective eternity. Turning to the extreme temperature gradients of hot spots, the evolution and formation of hot spots was considered in an expanding background for the first time, and a formalism treating the propagation of Hawking radiation was introduced. Upon addressing the previously unexplored effects of hot spots on Hawking radiation, it was discovered that hot spots can support successful leptogenesis after sphaleron freeze-out, and efficiently absorb radiated Dark Matter. These examples hint at an intricate, rich tapestry of physics in hot spots.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional Stationary Algebraically Special Solutions and Soft Hairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the Bondi-Sachs framework. The solutions consist of a pair of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes, and also three constant parameters originated from the $Y_{1,m}$ modes in spherical harmonic expansion. We show that the higher modes of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspectives of both the local gravitational degree of freedom and the asymptotic supertranslation charges. Within our general ansatz, we obtain from the zero modes the complete set of algebraic Petrov type-D solutions of four free parameters. We show that one parameter does not belong to the Plebanski-Demianski class and, therefore, yields a new type-D metric.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Magnetars: Exploring Type-I and Type-II States in Toroidal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The wavefunction of a quantum $S^1 \times S^2$ universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum gravity corrections to the no-boundary wavefunction describing a universe with spatial topology $S^1\times S^2$. It has been suggested that quantum effects become increasingly important when the size of the circle is large relative to the sphere. In this paper, we confirm this claim by an explicit four-dimensional one-loop calculation of the gravitational path integral preparing such a state. In the process, we clarify some aspects of the gravitational path integral on complex spacetimes. These quantum corrections play a crucial role in ensuring that the norm of the wavefunction is naturally expressed in terms of a path integral over $S^2 \times S^2$ at the classical level. We extend some of the analysis to more general spatial topologies, as well as to the inclusion of fermions.</description>

      <title>Inferring astrophysics and cosmology with individual compact binary coalescences and their gravitational-wave stochastic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) provide a new avenue to probe the cosmic expansion, in particular the Hubble constant $H_0$. The spectral sirens method is one of the most used techniques for GW cosmology. It consists of obtaining cosmological information from the GW luminosity distance, directly inferred from data, and the redshift that can be implicitly obtained from the source frame mass distribution of the CBC population. With GW detectors, populations of CBCs can be either observed as resolved individual sources or implicitly as a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the unresolved ones. In this manuscript, we study how resolved and unresolved sources of CBCs can be employed in the spectral siren framework to constrain cosmic expansion. The idea stems from the fact that the SGWB can constrain additional population properties of the CBCs thus potentially improving the measurement precision of the cosmic expansion parameters. We show that with a 5-detector network at O5-designed sensitivity, the inclusion of the SGWB will improve our ability to exclude low values of $H_0$ and the dark matter energy fraction $\Omega_m$, while also improving the determination of a possible CBC peak in redshift. Although low values of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ will be better constrained, we obtain that most on the precsion on $H_0$ will be provided by resolved spectral sirens. We also performed a spectral siren analysis for 59 resolved binary black hole sources detected during the third observing run with an inverse false alarm rate higher than 1 per year jointly with the SGWB. We obtain that with current sensitivities, the cosmological and population results are not impacted by the inclusion of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axially Symmetric Bianchi Type I Model with Self-Consistent Recombination History and Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological measurements suggest the possibility of an anisotropic universe. As a result, the Bianchi Type I model, being the simplest anisotropic extension to the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric has been extensively studied. In this work, we show how the recombination history should be modified in an anisotropic universe and derive observables by considering the null geodesic. We then constrain the axially symmetric Bianchi Type I model by performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo with the acoustic scales in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, together with local measurements of $H(z)$ and Pantheon Supernova data. Our results reveal that the anisotropic model is not worth a bare mention compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and we obtain a tight constraint on the anisotropy that generally agrees with previous studies under a maximum temperature anisotropy fraction of $2\times 10^{-5}$. To allow for a non-kinematic CMB dipole, we also present constraints based on a relaxed maximum temperature anisotropy comparable to that of the CMB dipole. We stress that there is a significant difference between the geodesic-based observables and the naive isotropic analogies when there is a noticeable anisotropy. However, the changes in recombination history are insignificant even under the relaxed anisotropy limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial correlators from multi-point propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key step in the comparison between inflationary predictions and cosmological observations is the computation of primordial correlators. Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP). We test the novel MPP method, and extensively compare it with the traditional implementation of the transport approach provided in PyTransport. We highlight advantages of the former, discussing its performance in terms of accuracy, precision and running time, as well as dependence on the number of e-folds of sub-horizon evolution and tolerance settings. For topical ultra-slow-roll models of inflation we show that MPPs (i) precisely track the decay of correlators even when PyTransport produces erroneous results, (ii) extend the computation of squeezed bispectra for squeezing values at least one decade beyond those attainable with PyTransport.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption in a Doubly Special Relativity Model with Undeformed Free Propagation and Total Momentum Conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process, once a prescription for the channel treatment is set. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation. The magnitude and observability of this deformation are examined as functions of the gamma-ray energy and source distance.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provides a unique opportunity to discern information about their astrophysical environment. Two signatures that are considered powerful tracers to distinguish between different binary formation channels are general-relativistic spin-induced orbital precession and orbital eccentricity. Both effects leave characteristic imprints in the gravitational-wave signal that can be extracted from observations. To date, neither precession nor eccentricity have been discerned in neutron star - black hole binaries. Here we report the first measurement of orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary. Using, for the first time, a waveform model that incorporates precession and eccentricity, we perform Bayesian inference on the event GW200105 and infer a median orbital eccentricity of $e_{20}\sim 0.145$ at an orbital period of $0.1$s, excluding zero at more than $99\%$ confidence. We find inconclusive evidence for the presence of precession, consistent with previous, non-eccentric results. Our result implies a fraction of these binaries will exhibit orbital eccentricity even at small separations, suggesting formation through mechanisms involving dynamical interactions beyond isolated binary evolution. Future observations will reveal the contribution of eccentric neutron star - black hole binaries to the total merger rate across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Ejecta Mass During the Search for Kilonovae Associated with Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers: A case study of S230518h, GW230529, S230627c and the Low-Significance Candidate S240422ed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, detectable via their gravitational-wave (GW) emission, are expected to produce kilonovae (KNe). Four NSBH candidates have been identified and followed-up by more than fifty instruments since the start of the fourth GW Observing Run (O4), in May 2023, up to July 2024; however, no confirmed associated KN has been detected. This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN: we use GW public information and joint observations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO, GRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF). First, our analysis on follow-up observation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50% of the simulated KNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day after merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each NSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on how these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying ejecta properties for each GW candidate. In particular, we can only confirm the kilonova was not missed for 1% of the GW230529 and S230627c sky localization region, given the large sky localization error of GW230529 and the large distance for S230627c and, their respective KN faint luminosities. More constraining, for S230518h, we infer the dynamical ejecta and post-merger disk wind ejecta $m_{dyn}, m_{wind}$ $&lt;$ $0.03$ $M_\odot$ and the viewing angle $\theta&gt;25^\circ$. Similarly, the non-astrophysical origin of S240422ed is likely further confirmed by the fact that we would have detected even a faint KN at the time and presumed distance of the S240422ed event candidate, within a minimum 45% credible region of the sky area, that can be larger depending on the KN scenario.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of Quantum-Corrected AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a metric ansatz designed to describe spherically symmetric quantum-corrected black hole (BH) space-time within an AdS space background, incorporating both an ordinary and a phantom global monopole. Our study focus into the thermodynamic properties of this BH, where we compute key parameters such as the Hawking temperature and specific heat capacity. We then proceed to analyze the effective potential of the system, considering both null and time-like geodesics, and investigate the shadow radius of the BH. Additionally, we calculate the emission rate of particles from the BH, providing insights into the energy dynamics. The geodesic equations of motion are explored to visualize the trajectories of massive particles within the BH. Throughout our investigation, we thoroughly examine how the inclusion of both ordinary and phantom global monopoles, combined with the quantum-corrected parameter, influences various thermal properties, the effective potential of the system, the BH shadow radius, energy emission rate, and the trajectories of massive particles. Importantly, by generating figures that depict these phenomena, we emphasize the differences in results obtained with ordinary global monopoles and phantom ones, considering a range of quantum-corrected parameter values and small energy scale parameters, which allows us to discern the distinct effects of each type of monopole in the black hole's behavior.</description>

Abstract: We take into account redshift-space distortion measurements to investigate the growth of cosmological large-scale structures within the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. After comparing the predictions of the $f(Q)$-gravity expansion history with OHD and SNIa Pantheon+ sample datasets and constraining the pertinent cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $H_0$, together with the exponent $n$ for $f(Q)$ power-law models, we derive the full system of equations governing linear cosmological perturbations to study matter fluctuations using the $1 + 3$ covariant formalism when applied to $f(Q)$ gravity. Thus, we resort to both the usual redshift-space distortion data $f\sigma_8$ and some recent separate measurements of the growth rate $f$ and the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations to find the best-fit cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $n$. We also apply a collective analysis of such growth-structure data together with the aforementioned cosmic expansion measurements, to restrict these parameters through Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations. determining the statistical significance for the best-fit parameter values through the AIC and BIC Bayesian selection criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the standard von Laue condition, the volume-averaged pressure inside particles of fixed mass and structure vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. Here we show that this condition is in general not fulfilled in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity, or of other theories of gravity in which the linear momentum is not conserved in this limit (here, $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively). We derive a generalized von Laue condition valid for the $\mathcal R(R) + \mathcal F(T)$ subclass of $f(R,T)$ theories of gravity and discuss its cosmological implications. In particular, we show that the standard radiation and matter era evolution of the universe is recovered in the context $R + \mathcal F(T)$ gravity independently of the specific properties of the function $\mathcal F(T)$. We also find that dust -- a perfect fluid whose particles are at rest in the fluid's proper frame -- cannot in general be described as pressureless in the context of these theories. We further discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of an ideal gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety of gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's capability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns about waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration signals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it challenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling methods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques. In this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\tt RIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave models without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate that our open-source code can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole binary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the numerical relativity surrogate model ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all available $m\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes on LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole binary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that the selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we analyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria challenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we find ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to complete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$ hours to complete.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity and in a gravitational extension of the Buckingham potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Keplerian-like parametrization of the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity studied in the literature. Some inconsistencies, which spoil Bertrand's theorem, observed in the $\eta$ parametrization of the true anomaly $\theta$ and in the formulae for the pericenter's advance are resolved. Moreover, inspired in this kind of study, we couple the Buckingham potential, a variation of the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, with the gravitational Newtonian potential and find a Keplerian-like parametrization for the solution of the two-body problem in this sort of gravity. The outcomes for the advance of the pericenter in both types of gravity are corroborated by using the Landau and Lifshitz's method. We also tested the expressions thus obtained against Solar System and S2 star data. The result for both models is that while some deviation from general relativity (GR) is allowed, GR cannot be discarded by the current analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational collapse and bubble evolution in the asymptotical Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe is an intriguing and intricate problem. We systematically analyze dynamics for contact \sch-FLRW (McVittie) spacetimes, focusing on their general junction conditions and introducing a novel function to simplify the extrinsic curvature and surface stress-energy tensor. We explore both static and dynamic scenarios, including special cases such as Schwarzschild, FLRW, and Einstein-Straus configurations by using our general framework. Numerical calculations further reveal the evolution of the concentric McVittie spacetimes with various initial conditions, offering deep insights into the interplay between the McVittie mass parameter and initial peculiar velocity. These results provide a unified perspective for understanding gravitational collapse and bubble evolution in cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms. We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>Extraction of energy from a black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been discovered that the nonlinear self-interaction of matter can induce energy extraction from black holes beyond superradiant instability. This process is closely associated with the occurrence of a dynamical first-order transition between different types of static black holes. To explore whether first-order phase transitions invariably lead to energy extraction, we have investigated the evolution of black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model with a higher-order coupling. In this model, there are also dynamical first-order phase transitions between black hole solutions. Our findings indicate that energy can only be extracted from a small, stable hairy black hole in this model. However, this energy extraction is more closely related to the growth of the black hole horizon radius, rather than the dynamical transition between different types of black holes. This suggests that a dynamical first-order phase transition does not necessarily result in energy extraction.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and the optical appearance of a thin accretion disk surrounding a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) within the framework of bumblebee gravity. We study the impact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter on various aspects of the disk, including its energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. By deriving and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we examine how the observational inclination angle and the LSB parameter affect image profile. We calculate and plot the distributions of both redshift and observed flux for the disk as seen by distant observers at different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that those distributions are influenced not only by the LSB parameter but also the observer's inclination angle.</description>

      <title>Extra Dimensions Beyond the Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an extra-dimensional braneworld with a 5th dimension compactified on a circle. As a characteristic feature, the warp factor is hyperbolic and separates the hidden and visible branes by a bulk horizon without a singularity. The two most widely separated scales of 4D physics - the 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant - are determined by two physical scales in the extra dimension, namely: $(i)$ the proper size of the extra dimension, $R$, and, $(ii)$ the distance between the visible brane and the horizon, $R_0$. A realistic scale hierarchy between 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant is obtained for $R/R_0\sim2.34$. The usual fine tuning is not reduced but promoted to a fine tuning of two separate brane energy densities that must approach the fundamental scale of the model with very high precision. Our scenario is based on an exact solution to the 5D Einstein equations with a strictly empty bulk and Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric on the 4D branes. This requires positive 4D brane energy densities and describes an adiabatic runaway solution in agreement with the de Sitter swampland conjecture. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton states are solutions of a modified P\"oschl-Teller potential which permits a discrete graviton spectrum of exactly two modes. In addition to the usual massless graviton, our scenario predicts an extra massive spin-2 graviton with a mass gap of $m_1=\sqrt{2}H_0\approx2\times10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$ which might be detectable in the foreseeable future. A KK tower of gravitons, or a possible continuum of massive graviton states, is prohibited by unitarity with respect to the horizon. We discuss hurdles in turning this model into a realistic cosmology at all times, which points us towards 4D brane tensions that that must be raising towards the fundamental scale of the model, while the observable 4D expansion rate is decreasing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to an almost bi-hermitian space with isometry and investigate integrability on its T-dualized one. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized space still admits integrability of the almost complex structures. We also observe that the form of H-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <title>Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in Gauge/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Freelance Holography, Part II: Moving Boundary in Gauge/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue developing the freelance holography program, formulating gauge/gravity correspondence where the gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary inside AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory. Our analyses here extend the extensively studied T$\bar{\text{T}}$-deformation by relaxing the boundary conditions at asymptotic AdS or at the cutoff surface to be any arbitrary one (besides Dirichlet). We discuss some of the implications of our general freelance holography setting.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>
