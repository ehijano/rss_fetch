      <title>An Overview of the Prospects and Challenges of Using Artificial Intelligence for Energy Management Systems in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS, namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability, data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of future AI-based EMS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents VIMPPI, a novel control approach for underactuated double pendulum systems developed for the AI Olympics competition. We enhance the Model Predictive Path Integral framework by incorporating variational integration techniques, enabling longer planning horizons without additional computational cost. Operating at 500-700 Hz with control interpolation and disturbance detection mechanisms, VIMPPI substantially outperforms both baseline methods and alternative MPPI implementations</description>

      <title>Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm for Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have demonstrated promise in modeling and controlling systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Beyond PDEs, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) play a critical role in modeling systems influenced by randomness, with applications in finance, physics, and beyond. However, controlling SPDE-governed systems remains a significant challenge. On the one hand, the regularity of the system's state (which can be intuitively understood as smoothness) deteriorates, making modeling and generalization more challenging. On the other hand, this stochasticity also renders control more unstable and thus less accurate. To address this gap, we propose the Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm (MB-CC), the first model-based closed-loop control method for SPDEs. MB-CC introduces two key innovations to enhance control robustness and efficiency: a Regularity Feature (RF) block and a closed-loop strategy with an operator-encoded policy network. The RF block, inspired by the regularity structure theory of SPDEs, addresses noise-induced irregularities by transforming the network's input, including the system state and noise-perturbed external forces, into a refined feature space for improved forward prediction. Compared to previous works using regularity features, we introduce a new parameterization, data augmentation, and extend the RF block as a plug-and-play component. Additionally, to achieve closed-loop control, we introduce an operator-encoded policy network to map the current state to optimal control, which integrates physical priors and swiftly makes decisions based on states returned by the environment. We conduct a systematic evaluation of MB-CC on two notable SPDEs, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency. The ablation studies show its ability to handle stochasticity more effectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Management of Airport Security Queues Considering Passenger Non-compliance with Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long waiting time at airport security has become an emergent issue as demand for air travel continues to grow. Not only does queuing at security cause passengers to miss their flights, but also reduce the amount of time passengers spend at the airport post-security, potentially leading to less revenue for the airport operator. One of the key issues to address to reduce waiting time is the management of arrival priority. As passengers on later flights can arrive before passengers on earlier flights, the security system does not always process passengers in the order of the degree of urgency. In this paper, we propose a chance-constrained optimization model that decides in which time slot passengers should be recommended to arrive. We use chance constraints to obtain solutions that take the uncertainty in passenger non-compliance into account. The experimental results, based on a sample day of flight schedules at the Barcelona airport, show a reduction of 85% in the total waiting time. Compared to the deterministic case, in which passengers are assumed to fully comply with the recommendations, we see a 30% increase in the reduction of the total waiting time. This highlights the importance of considering variation in passenger compliance in the management of airport security queues.</description>

      <title>Connected C-Core Hybrid SRMs for EV Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new class of permanent magnet-assisted three-phase switched reluctance motors (PM-SRMs) designed to achieve significantly higher torque density for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion systems. Eight distinct motor topologies are systematically investigated, including a non-PM baseline design, three innovative PM arrangement strategies, and two optimized rotor/stator teeth configurations (22-pole and 26-pole variants). The study presents analytical models including magnetic equivalent circuits (MECs), detailed operating principles, and generalized design formulations that account for both electromagnetic and structural considerations. A key contribution is the introduction of the point-of-conversion (PoC) concept, which optimizes PM placement by minimizing magnetic path reluctance. Comparative analysis demonstrates torque density improvements over conventional SRMs and existing PM-assisted designs while maintaining structural robustness. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed 24/22 configuration with inter-phase PMs delivers higher torque per PM volume compared to state-of-the-art designs. The findings provide insights for EV motor designers seeking to balance performance, cost, and reliability.</description>

      <title>A Feedback Control Framework for Incentivised Suburban Parking Utilisation and Urban Core Traffic Relief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, exacerbated by inefficient parking management and cruising for parking, significantly hampers mobility and sustainability in smart cities. Drivers often face delays searching for parking spaces, influenced by factors such as accessibility, cost, distance, and available services such as charging facilities in the case of electric vehicles. These inefficiencies contribute to increased urban congestion, fuel consumption, and environmental impact. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a feedback control incentivisation-based system that aims to better distribute vehicles between city and suburban parking facilities offering park-and-charge/-ride services. Individual driver behaviours are captured via discrete choice models incorporating factors of importance to parking location choice among drivers, such as distance to work, public transport connectivity, charging infrastructure availability, and amount of incentive offered; and are regulated through principles of ergodic control theory. The proposed framework is applied to an electric vehicle park-and-charge/-ride problem, and demonstrates how predictable long-term behaviour of the system can be guaranteed.</description>

      <title>DeepSync: A Learning Framework for Pervasive Localization using Code Synchronization on Compressed Cellular Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pervasive localization is essential for continuous tracking applications, yet existing solutions face challenges in balancing power consumption and accuracy. GPS, while precise, is impractical for continuous tracking of micro-assets due to high power requirements. Recent advances in non-linear compressed spectrum sensing offer low-power alternatives, but existing implementations achieve only coarse positioning through Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. We present DeepSync, a deep learning framework that enables precise localization using compressed cellular spectrum. Our key technical insight lies in formulating sub-sample timing estimation as a template matching problem, solved through a novel architecture combining temporal CNN encoders for multi-frame processing with cross-attention mechanisms. The system processes non-linear inter-modulated spectrum through hierarchical feature extraction, achieving robust performance at SNR levels below -10dB -- a regime where conventional timing estimation fails. By integrating real cellular infrastructure data with physics-based ray-tracing simulations, DeepSync achieves 2.128-meter median accuracy while consuming significantly less power than conventional systems. Real-world evaluations demonstrate 10x improvement over existing compressed spectrum approaches, establishing a new paradigm for ultra-low-power localization.</description>

      <title>Formation Maneuver Control Based on the Augmented Laplacian Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formation maneuver control method for both 2-D and 3-D space, which enables the formation to translate, scale, and rotate with arbitrary orientation. The core innovation is the novel design of weights in the proposed augmented Laplacian matrix. Instead of using scalars, we represent weights as matrices, which are designed based on a specified rotation axis and allow the formation to perform rotation in 3-D space. To further improve the flexibility and scalability of the formation, the rotational axis adjustment approach and dynamic agent reconfiguration method are developed, allowing formations to rotate around arbitrary axes in 3-D space and new agents to join the formation. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the proposed approach preserves the original configuration of the formation. The proposed method maintains the advantages of the complex Laplacian-based method, including reduced neighbor requirements and no reliance on generic or convex nominal configurations, while achieving arbitrary orientation rotations via a more simplified implementation. Simulations in both 2-D and 3-D space validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop AI for HVAC Management Enhancing Comfort and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings, offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic and environmental goals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) techniques are capable of improving the tracking performance of control systems that repeatedly perform similar tasks by utilizing data from past iterations. The aim of this paper is to design a systematic approach for learning parameterized feedforward signals with limited complexity. The developed method involves an iterative learning control in conjunction with a data-driven sparse subset selection procedure for basis function selection. The ILC algorithm that employs sparse optimization is able to automatically select relevant basis functions and is validated on an industrial flatbed printer.</description>

      <title>Integrating Building Thermal Flexibility Into Distribution System: A Privacy-Preserved Dispatch Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent thermal storage capacity of buildings brings considerable thermal flexibility to the heating/cooling loads, which are promising demand response resources for power systems. It is widely believed that integrating the thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve the operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private information of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy concerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved optimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings. Using it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without accessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor temperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model for the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to other storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the privacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation problem for both parameters and state variables and then design a privacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption, constraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we implement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Shortlisting Protection Configurations for HVDC Grids and Electrical Energy Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology for shortlisting protection system configurations for large HVDC switching stations, which are expected in multiterminal HVDC grids and electrical energy hubs (or energy islands). This novel approach focuses on the configuration of protection equipment and the arrangement of lines and converters in various protection zones, instead of expert decisions on protection strategies based on numerous simulations. A graph-based approach that allows high-level evaluation of possible DC fault impacts is presented. This fault impact evaluation method can evaluate many possible protection configurations allowing the selection of less obvious choices, as experts cannot consider all possible configurations, especially when the switching station size increases. A filtering process is applied to reduce the number of possible configurations based on multiple protection performance metrics which are evaluated for different power flow scenarios. The results for these performance metrics can be compared for configurations with different numbers of HVDC circuit breakers to assess the benefit of increasing the amount of protection equipment in different network topologies. It is also shown that, through continued filtering using additional performance metrics or fault scenarios, the number of possible breaker, cable and converter configurations can be further reduced, leading to a protection design that is well suited for many operational scenarios. The results of the shortlisting process provide insights on the required number of HVDC circuit breakers to limit fault impacts to a given value. Moreover, observed trends in the results could, in future studies, contribute to new design principles and priorities, allowing system developers to more effectively design HVDC protection systems for different operational scenarios and possible investment levels.</description>

      <title>Design and Application of Energy-saving Sub-Optimal Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced energy-saving extension of the sub-optimal sliding mode control (SOSMC), which is known in the literature for the last two and half decades, incorporates a control-off mode that allows for saving energy during the finite-time convergence process. This novel energy-saving algorithm (denoted by ES-SOSMC) assumes the systems with relative degree two between the sliding variable and the switching control with a bounded magnitude, while the matched upper-bounded perturbations are not necessarily continuous. The design and practical application of the ES-SOSMC are the subject of this chapter. A method for parameterizing the ES-SOSMC through a constrained minimization of the energy cost function is recalled which guarantees the total energy consumption is lower than that of the conventional SOSMC. Also the residual steady-state oscillations (chattering), occurring when additional (actuator) dynamics are taken into account, are addressed. An application example for scanning and machining a rough surface, both of which require a stiff position control in contact with a moving surface, demonstrates practical suitability of the control. Here, ES-SOSMC is compared with SOSMC by showing an equivalent tracking and stabilization performance and evaluating the energy-saving operation with respect to a fuel consumption norm.</description>

      <title>Priority-Driven Safe Model Predictive Control Approach to Autonomous Driving Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the applicability of the safe model predictive control (SMPC) framework to autonomous driving scenarios, focusing on the design of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and automated lane-change systems. Building on the SMPC approach with priority-driven constraint softening -- which ensures the satisfaction of \emph{hard} constraints under external disturbances by selectively softening a predefined subset of adjustable constraints -- we show how the algorithm dynamically relaxes lower-priority, comfort-related constraints in response to unexpected disturbances while preserving critical safety requirements such as collision avoidance and lane-keeping. A learning-based algorithm approximating the time consuming SMPC is introduced to enable real-time execution. Simulations in real-world driving scenarios subject to unpredicted disturbances confirm that this prioritized softening mechanism consistently upholds stringent safety constraints, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Electrified Supply Chains to Provide Long Duration Demand Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand flexibility can offset some of the variability introduced on the supply-side by variable renewable generation. However, most efforts (e.g. control of residential vehicle charging) focus on short durations -- typically on the scale of minutes to hours. This paper investigates whether a fully electrified supply chain (transport and manufacturing) could provide demand flexibility over longer durations, exploiting the latency that typically exists between the processing of raw material to the delivery of finished product. Using a case study of the cement industry along the East Coast of the United States, we demonstrate that electrified supply chains could shift gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity demand for durations of more than a week, largely following wind power variability. Furthermore, we show that this occurs using low levels of carbon taxing (below $50/tn), at which battery storage is not economically viable. A sensitivity analysis shows potential to provide flexibility in all considered cost scenarios, although where the flexibility comes from can change (e.g. transport vs manufacturing). We show that today's cost of electrified heavy goods vehicles are the most significant parameter -- with substantially lower costs yielding a more demand-flexible supply chain.</description>

      <title>Zero Dynamics Attack Detection and Isolation in Cyber-Physical Systems with Event-triggered Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Zero Dynamics (ZD) cyber-attack detection and isolation in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). By utilizing the notion of auxiliary systems with event-based communications, we will develop a detection mechanism capable of detecting and isolating the ZD cyber-attack even when the attackers have full knowledge of the dynamics of the auxiliary system and can launch False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on all the communication channels. More specifically, we will utilize a self-triggering rule for the communication channels connecting the auxiliary system with the Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) center, leveraging its properties to detect the ZD cyber-attack. Finally, the effectiveness and capabilities of our approach are verified and demonstrated through simulation case studies.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Aware Parameter Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Coupled Systems via Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of parameter privacy-preserving data sharing in coupled systems, where a data provider shares data with a data user but wants to protect its sensitive parameters. The shared data affects not only the data user's decision-making but also the data provider's operations through system interactions. To trade off control performance and privacy, we propose an interaction-aware privacy-preserving data sharing approach. Our approach generates distorted data by minimizing a combination of (i) mutual information, quantifying privacy leakage of sensitive parameters, and (ii) the impact of distorted data on the data provider's control performance, considering the interactions between stakeholders. The optimization problem is formulated into a Bellman equation and solved by a particle filter reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Compared to existing RL-based methods, our formulation significantly reduces history dependency and efficiently handles scenarios with continuous state space. Validated in a mixed-autonomy platoon scenario, our method effectively protects sensitive driving behavior parameters of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) against inference attacks while maintaining negligible impact on fuel efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multi-Task Learning for Multi-Label Power System Security Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to the power system security assessment using Multi-Task Learning (MTL), and reformulating the problem as a multi-label classification task. The proposed MTL framework simultaneously assesses static, voltage, transient, and small-signal stability, improving both accuracy and interpretability with respect to the most state of the art machine learning methods. It consists of a shared encoder and multiple decoders, enabling knowledge transfer between stability tasks. Experiments on the IEEE 68-bus system demonstrate a measurable superior performance of the proposed method compared to the extant state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>OccuEMBED: Occupancy Extraction Merged with Building Energy Disaggregation for Occupant-Responsive Operation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</description>

      <title>Constraint Selection in Optimization-Based Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-machine collaboration often involves constrained optimization problems for decision-making processes. However, when the machine is a dynamical system with a continuously evolving state, infeasibility due to multiple conflicting constraints can lead to dangerous outcomes. In this work, we propose a heuristic-based method that resolves infeasibility at every time step by selectively disregarding a subset of soft constraints based on the past values of the Lagrange multipliers. Compared to existing approaches, our method requires the solution of a smaller optimization problem to determine feasibility, resulting in significantly faster computation. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Barrier Function Overrides For Non-Convex Fixed Wing Flight Control and Self-Driving Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled vast performance improvements for robotics systems. To achieve these results though, the agent often must randomly explore the environment, which for safety critical systems presents a significant challenge. Barrier functions can solve this challenge by enabling an override that approximates the RL control input as closely as possible without violating a safety constraint. Unfortunately, this override can be computationally intractable in cases where the dynamics are not convex in the control input or when time is discrete, as is often the case when training RL systems. We therefore consider these cases, developing novel barrier functions for two non-convex systems (fixed wing aircraft and self-driving cars performing lane merging with adaptive cruise control) in discrete time. Although solving for an online and optimal override is in general intractable when the dynamics are nonconvex in the control input, we investigate approximate solutions, finding that these approximations enable performance commensurate with baseline RL methods with zero safety violations. In particular, even without attempting to solve for the optimal override at all, performance is still competitive with baseline RL performance. We discuss the tradeoffs of the approximate override solutions including performance and computational tractability.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drive Anywhere with Model-Based Reannotation11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: Motion Prediction Models beyond Open-Loop Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

      <title>Versatile Distributed Maneuvering with Generalized Formations using Guiding Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified approach to realize versatile distributed maneuvering with generalized formations. Specifically, we decompose the robots' maneuvers into two independent components, i.e., interception and enclosing, which are parameterized by two independent virtual coordinates. Treating these two virtual coordinates as dimensions of an abstract manifold, we derive the corresponding singularity-free guiding vector field (GVF), which, along with a distributed coordination mechanism based on the consensus theory, guides robots to achieve various motions (i.e., versatile maneuvering), including (a) formation tracking, (b) target enclosing, and (c) circumnavigation. Additional motion parameters can generate more complex cooperative robot motions. Based on GVFs, we design a controller for a nonholonomic robot model. Besides the theoretical results, extensive simulations and experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Information Updates in Compute-First Networking via Reinforcement Learning with Joint AoI and VoI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and efficient dissemination of service information is critical in compute-first networking systems, where user requests arrive dynamically and computing resources are constrained. In such systems, the access point (AP) plays a key role in forwarding user requests to a server based on its latest received service information. This paper considers a single-source, single-destination system and introduces an Age-and-Value-Aware (AVA) metric that jointly captures both the timeliness and the task relevance of service information. Unlike traditional freshness-based metrics, AVA explicitly incorporates variations in server-side service capacity and AP forwarding decisions, allowing more context-aware update evaluation. Building upon AVA, we propose a reinforcement learning-based update policy that learns to selectively transmit service information updates to the AP. It aims to maximize overall task success while minimizing unnecessary communications. Extensive simulations under diverse user request patterns and varying service capacities demonstrate that AVA reduces the update frequency by over 90% on average compared to baselines, with reductions reaching 98% in certain configurations. Crucially, this reduction is achieved without compromising the accuracy of task execution or the quality of decision making.</description>

      <title>Extending the Control Plane of Container Orchestrators for I/O Virtualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) is a standard technology for forking a single PCI express device and providing it to applications while ensuring performance isolation. It enables container orchestrators to share a limited number of physical network interfaces without incurring significant virtualization overhead. The allocation of virtualized network devices to containers, however, needs to be more configurable based on the bandwidth needs of running applications. Moreover, container orchestrators' network control over the virtualized interfaces is limited by the abilities of SR-IOV. We explore the design considerations for a system with controlled SR-IOV virtualization and present ConRDMA, a novel architecture that enables fine control of RDMA virtualization for containers. Our evaluation shows that ConRDMA enables containers to use RDMA allocated bandwidth more efficiently and to select best-suited nodes to meet their varying communication requirements.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a centralized approach for fuel-efficient urban platooning by leveraging real-time Vehicle- to-Everything (V2X) communication and Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data. A nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm optimizes the trajectories of platoon leader vehicles, employing an asymmetric cost function to minimize fuel-intensive acceleration. Following vehicles utilize a gap- and velocity-based control strategy, complemented by dynamic platoon splitting logic communicated through Platoon Control Messages (PCM) and Platoon Awareness Messages (PAM). Simulation results obtained from the CARLA environment demonstrate substantial fuel savings of up to 41.2%, along with smoother traffic flows, fewer vehicle stops, and improved intersection throughput.</description>

      <title>ABAMGuid+: An Enhanced Aerocapture Guidance Framework using Augmented Bank Angle Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerocapture consists of converting a hyperbolic approach trajectory into a captured target orbit utilizing the aerodynamic forces generated via a single pass through the atmosphere. Aerocapture guidance systems must be robust to significant environmental variations and modeling uncertainty, particularly regarding atmospheric properties and delivery conditions. Recent work has shown that enabling control over both bank angle and angle of attack, a strategy referred to as augmented bank angle modulation (ABAM), can improve robustness to entry state and atmospheric uncertainties. In this work, we derive optimal control solutions for an aerocapture vehicle using ABAM. We first formulate the problem using a linear aerodynamic model and derive closed-form optimal control profiles using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. To increase modeling fidelity, we also consider a quadratic aerodynamic model and obtain the solution directly using the optimality conditions. Both formulations are solved numerically using Gauss pseudospectral methods (via GPOPS, a software tool for pseudospectral optimal control), to validate the analytic solutions. We then introduce a novel aerocapture guidance algorithm, ABAMGuid+, which indirectly minimizes propellant usage by mimicking the structure of the optimal control solution, enabling efficient guidance by avoiding the complexity of solving the full optimal control problem online. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a Uranus aerocapture mission demonstrate that ABAMGuid+ increases capture success rates and reduces post-capture propellant requirements relative to previous methods.</description>

Abstract: We study the robustness of an agent decision-making model in finite-population games, with a particular focus on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model. Specifically, we examine how the model's parameters influence the effects of various sources of noise and modeling inaccuracies -- factors commonly encountered in engineering applications of population games -- on agents' decision-making. Our analysis provides insights into how these parameters can be effectively tuned to mitigate such effects. Theoretical results are supported by numerical examples and simulation studies that validate the analysis and illustrate practical strategies for parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Modelling of a DC-DC Buck Converter Using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks make it possible to identify black-box models. Based on a recurrent nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network, this research provides a technique for simulating the static and dynamic behavior of a DC-DC power converter. This approach employs an algorithm for training a neural network using the inputs and outputs (currents and voltages) of a Buck converter. The technique is validated using simulated data of a realistic Simulink-programmed nonsynchronous Buck converter model and experimental findings. The correctness of the technique is determined by comparing the predicted outputs of the neural network to the actual outputs of the system, thereby confirming the suggested strategy. Simulation findings demonstrate the practicability and precision of the proposed black-box method.</description>

      <title>Tuning a Cascaded Online Feedback Optimization Controller for Provision of Distributed Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</description>

      <title>GreenLight-Gym: Reinforcement learning benchmark environment for control of greenhouse production systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents GreenLight-Gym, a new, fast, open-source benchmark environment for developing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in greenhouse crop production control. Built on the state-of-the-art GreenLight model, it features a differentiable C++ implementation leveraging the CasADi framework for efficient numerical integration. GreenLight-Gym improves simulation speed by a factor of 17 over the original GreenLight implementation. A modular Python environment wrapper enables flexible configuration of control tasks and RL-based controllers. This flexibility is demonstrated by learning controllers under parametric uncertainty using two well-known RL algorithms. GreenLight-Gym provides a standardized benchmark for advancing RL methodologies and evaluating greenhouse control solutions under diverse conditions. The greenhouse control community is encouraged to use and extend this benchmark to accelerate innovation in greenhouse crop production.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Meta Distribution Reliability Analysis of Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication reliability, as defined by 3GPP, refers to the probability of providing a desired quality of service (QoS). This metric is typically quantified for wireless networks by averaging the QoS success indicator over spatial and temporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has emerged as a two-level performance analysis tool for wireless networks, offering a detailed examination of the outer level (i.e., system-level) reliability versus the inner level (i.e., link-level) reliability thresholds. Most existing studies focus on first-order spatiotemporal MD reliability analyses, and the benefits of leveraging MD reliability for applications beyond this structure remain unexplored, a gap addressed in this paper. We propose a framework for the analysis of higher-order MD reliability of wireless networks considering different levels of temporal dynamicity of random elements in the network where the MD at each layer is leveraged to be used in calculating the MD of the higher layer. We then provide two applications for this framework and provide a detailed analytical and numerical study of the higher-order MD reliability for both examples. The results demonstrate the value of the hierarchical representation of MD reliability across three domains and the impact of the inner-layers target reliabilities on the overall MD reliability measure.</description>

      <title>On the $H$-property for Step-graphons: Residual Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $H$-property for step-graphons. Specifically, we sample graphs $G_n$ on $n$ nodes from a step-graphon and evaluate the probability that $G_n$ has a Hamiltonian decomposition in the asymptotic regime as $n\to\infty$. It has been shown that for almost all step-graphons, this probability converges to either zero or one. We focus in this paper on the residual case where the zero-one law does not apply. We show that the limit of the probability still exists and provide an explicit expression of it. We present a complete proof of the result and validate it through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Parameter Invariance Analysis of Moment Equations Using Dulmage-Mendelsohn Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a property that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Optimization of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</description>

      <title>Exact Imposition of Safety Boundary Conditions in Neural Reachable Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely adopted verification tool to provide safety and performance guarantees for autonomous systems. However, it involves solving a partial differential equation (PDE) to compute a safety value function, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making its direct application to large-scale systems intractable. To overcome these challenges, DeepReach, a recently proposed learning-based approach, approximates high-dimensional reachable tubes using neural networks (NNs). While shown to be effective, the accuracy of the learned solution decreases with system complexity. One of the reasons for this degradation is a soft imposition of safety constraints during the learning process, which corresponds to the boundary conditions of the PDE, resulting in inaccurate value functions. In this work, we propose ExactBC, a variant of DeepReach that imposes safety constraints exactly during the learning process by restructuring the overall value function as a weighted sum of the boundary condition and the NN output. Moreover, the proposed variant no longer needs a boundary loss term during the training process, thus eliminating the need to balance different loss terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in significantly improving the accuracy of the learned value function for four challenging reachability tasks: a rimless wheel system with state resets, collision avoidance in a cluttered environment, autonomous rocket landing, and multi-aircraft collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Opacity Enforcement by Edit Functions Under Incomparable Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an information-flow privacy property, opacity characterizes whether a malicious external observer (referred to as an intruder) is able to infer the secret behavior of a system. This paper addresses the problem of opacity enforcement using edit functions in discrete event systems modeled by partially observed deterministic finite automata. A defender uses the edit function as an interface at the output of a system to manipulate actual observations through insertion, substitution, and deletion operations so that the intruder will be prevented from inferring the secret behavior of the system. Unlike existing work which usually assumes that the observation capabilities of the intruder and the defender are identical, we consider a more general setting where they may observe incomparable subsets of events generated by the system.To characterize whether the defender has the ability to enforce opacity of the system under this setting, the notion of \emph{$ic$-enforceability} is introduced. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a two-player game, with imperfect information between the system and the defender, which can be used to determine a feasible decision-making strategy for the defender. Within the game scheme, an edit mechanism is constructed to enumerate all feasible edit actions following system behavior. We further show that an $ic$-enforcing edit function (if one exists) can be synthesized from the edit mechanism to enforce opacity.</description>

      <title>GNN-DT: Graph Neural Network Enhanced Decision Transformer for Efficient Optimization in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</description>
