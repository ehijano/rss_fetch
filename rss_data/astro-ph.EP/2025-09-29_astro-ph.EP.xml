      <title>Re-accretion of Giant Impact Ejecta Can Drive Significant Atmospheric Erosion on Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant impacts, the collisions between planetary embryos, play a crucial role in sculpting the planets and their orbital architectures. Numerical simulations have advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass and atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational costs have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our understanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate the effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously overlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the collisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary impacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the progenitor. We find that $\sim 0.003\ M_{\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a wide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\%$ of their mass is ejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts during re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from the debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an atmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any planet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience significant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was at least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial role secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the long-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that giant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres than previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered.</description>

      <title>Ross 458c: Gas Giant or Brown Dwarf?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ross 458c is a widely separated planetary mass companion at a distance of 1100 AU from its host binary, Ross 458AB. It is a member of a class of very low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\sim$2700) emission spectra of Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\mu$m. We fit these spectra using both grids of forward models (Sonora Bobcat, Sonora Elf Owl, and ExoREM) and atmospheric retrievals (POSEIDON). We also constrain the composition of Ross 458AB by fitting an archival SpeX spectrum with PHOENIX forward models. The forward model grids prefer an enhanced atmospheric metallicity for Ross 458c relative to the host, but our retrievals return a metallicity consistent with the host within 1$\sigma$. Our results offer new insights into the formation history of Ross 458c, as well as the efficacy of fitting forward model grids versus retrievals to derive atmospheric properties of directly imaged companions.</description>

      <title>Testing the Impact of Planet-stirring, Self-stirring, and Mixed-stirring on Debris Disc Architecture: A Case Study of HD 16743</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions between planets and debris discs can excite the orbits of embedded planetesimals to such a degree that a collisional cascade is triggered, generating detectable amounts of dust. Millimetre wavelength observations are sensitive to emission from large and cold dust grains, which are unperturbed by radiation forces and act as a proxy for the location of the planetesimals. The influence of unseen planetary companions on debris discs can be inferred with high-resolution imaging observations at millimetre wavelengths, tracing the radial and vertical structure of these belts. Here we present a set of dynamical $N$-body simulations modelling ALMA millimetre-wavelength observations of the HD 16743 debris disc system. In these simulations, we consider a range of relative contributions from either a single planetary companion and/or a set of embedded massive planetesimals to reproduce the disc's observed radial and vertical structure. We compare our dynamical results for the limiting cases of planet-stirring and self-stirring, finding them to be consistent with theoretical expectations for each scenario. For the case of HD 16743, we find that a set of massive planetesimals on mildly eccentric orbits, confined to a relatively narrow range of semimajor axes (compared to the observed belt width), offers the best results to reproduce the vertical and radial extent of the observed emission.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Desert Dwellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``sub-Jovian desert" ($2{\lesssim}R_{\rm p}{\lesssim}10 \ R_{\oplus}$, periods $\lesssim$3 days) is sparsely populated but no longer empty. Recent surveys have revealed that planets residing in the desert are dense (${\rho}{\gtrsim}1$ g/cm$^{3}$), massive ($\sim$10${-}$50 $M_{\oplus}$), and orbit metal-rich stars that are indistinguishable from those hosting hot Jupiters. However, their origins remain mysterious. In this work we adopt and test the hypothesis that tidal destruction of hot Jupiters can populate the sub-Jovian desert with stripped remnant planets. We first show that stars hosting desert dwellers exhibit Galactic kinematics indicative of an older population descended from those hosting hot Jupiters. We highlight that tidally-driven Roche lobe overflow (RLO) can indeed populate the desert with planets similar to those observed, but only if angular momentum transfer during RLO is inefficient (``lossy" RLO). The entire width of the sub-Jovian desert can be backfilled with the remnants of hot Jupiters that possessed their empirically inferred spread in entropy. In this picture, current desert dwellers such as LTT 9779b should be tidally decaying at an observationally testable rate of ${\sim}0.5$ ms/yr. Our theory also predicts that desert dweller host stars may rotate up to an order of magnitude more rapidly than field stars; rotation period differences may persist ${\sim}$Gyr after RLO. Lossy RLO may also manifest as a burst of IR excess that could outshine the host star for up to ${\sim}10^{3}$ yr. If these predictions are confirmed by observations, our theory indicates that desert dwellers can be leveraged to study the interiors of giant planets in exquisite detail.</description>

      <title>Induced-Flare Candidates from the TESS Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical underabundance of close-in planets with radii 1.5-2.0 times that of the Earth, referred to as the radius irradiation valley, may be linked to the inability of gas dwarfs under certain conditions to retain their volatile envelopes due to photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. In either case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares as it moves near its periastron within the Alfv\'en surface of its host star. We construct a pipeline, \textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures. We identify one close-in, eccentric ($e=0.18$) system, TOI-1062\,b, which exhibits flaring during periastron consistent with being induced with $p_{KS}=2.2\times10^{-5}$ and a $5.1\sigma$ detection through unbinned likelihood analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. We also identify an additional eccentric ($e=0.363$) candidate, Gliese 49b, which exhibits moderately significant ($2.5\sigma$) flare clustering at periastron, requiring additional photometric observations to confirm its significance. TOI-1062b and Gliese 49b are promising candidates for induced flares, underscoring the need for radio and UV follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Coupled Planetary Interior and Tidal Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new planetary structure/thermal evolution model, designed for use in problems that couple orbital dynamics with planetary structure. We first benchmark our structural/thermal evolution calculations against the \texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, finding excellent agreement across a wide range of planet mass, equilibrium temperature, entropy, and extra heating deposited at various depths in the planet. We then apply our method to study the tidal migration histories of Neptunes in the recently identified ``ridge" (periods ${\sim}3{-}6$ days), a feature that has been suggested to be populated via high eccentricity migration (HEM) of more distant Neptunes. We find that it is difficult to form a circularized Neptune in the ridge without instigating runaway tidal inflation and likely atmospheric destruction; low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge can only be emplaced by HEM if they are metal-rich and exhibit finely-tuned tidal quality factors. If follow-up observations confirm that low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge did arrive via HEM and are not strongly enriched in metals, our calculations indicate that their tidal heating mechanism must operate in the upper reaches of the planet to avoid runaway inflation. Gravity modes excited in upper radiative layers are a possible candidate mechanism, while friction in the core or turbulent dissipation in convective zones could be ruled out.</description>

      <title>The Near-Infrared Spectral Characteristics of Water Ice, Epsomite, and Halite Mixtures Relevant to Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We publish the first NIR spectra of grain particulate mixtures of water ice, epsomite, and halite at cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we perform a quantitative assessment of the ability of both intimately- and linearly-mixed models to reproduce laboratory data of different grain mixtures of water ice, as well as water ice mixed with epsomite. We find that smaller grains of water ice impart a stronger influence than larger grains of water ice on the 2.0 {\mu}m spectral feature in epsomite, and grain size signatures for both halite and epsomite are challenging to discern for larger grain sizes as a result of the saturated absorption features. These findings may indicate that an observation bias toward smaller grain sizes of ice could exist, and that quantitative assessments provided by spectral mixture analyses will be the most reliable method for determining compositions and abundances of materials. We also find that the linearly-mixed and intimately-mixed models of water ice appear to match the laboratory spectra as expected, though still display some inconsistencies, often either in the continuum or the absorption features. When modeling pure water ice and water ice mixed with epsomite, no discernible difference is observed between the fits of the linearly- and intimately-mixed models. Future spectral mixture analyses that use epsomite should be aware of a potential error in the published epsomite optical constant data, in which the cryogenic data appear to be taken at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>HARPS-N Reveals a Well-aligned Orbit for the Highly Eccentric Warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many hot Jupiter systems have a measured obliquity, few warm Jupiter systems do. The longer orbital periods and transit durations of warm Jupiters make it more difficult to measure the obliquities of their host stars. However, the longer periods also mean any misalignments persist due to the longer tidal realignment timescales. As a result, measuring these obliquities is necessary to understand how these types of planets form and how their formation and evolution differ from that of hot Jupiters. Here, we report the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the TOI-4127 system using the HARPS-N spectrograph. We model the system using our new HARPS-N radial velocity measurements in addition to archival TESS photometry and NEID and SOPHIE radial velocities. We find that the host star is well-aligned with the highly eccentric (e=0.75) warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b, with a sky-projected obliquity ${\lambda} = {4^\circ}^{+17^\circ}_{-16^\circ}$. This makes TOI-4127 one of the most eccentric well-aligned systems to date and one of the longest period systems with a measured obliquity. Conclusions. The origin of its highly eccentric yet well-aligned orbit remains a mystery, however, and we investigate possible scenarios that could explain it. While typical in-situ formation and disk migration scenarios cannot explain this system, certain scenarios involving resonant interactions between the planet and protoplanetary disc could. Similarly, specific cases of planet-planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations can result in a highly-eccentric and well-aligned orbit. Coplanar high-eccentricity migration could also explain this system. However, both this mechanism and Kozai-Lidov oscillations require an additional planet in the system that has not yet been detected.</description>

      <title>How clear are the skies of WASP-80b?: 3D Cloud feedback on the atmosphere and spectra of the warm Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo, heat distribution, and spectral properties. We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and transmission spectra to comprehensively characterize its atmosphere, including cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the observations with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs). We use a General Circulation Model (GCM), ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra are well fit by cloudless GCMs. The data appear to be compatible with large cloud particles of any cloud species or KCl clouds of all particle sizes. The Na$_2$S condensates of radii 0.1 and 1 $\mu$m can be ruled out due to the strength of their radiative feedback. This showcases the unique insights that can be obtained from global modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Detection of OH and Fe in the dayside atmosphere of the hottest ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous measurements of volatile and refractory elements are essential for tracing the formation and migration of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs). High-resolution infrared emission spectroscopy has been widely used to probe their atmospheres, covering molecules and atoms. For the hottest known planet, KELT-9b, whose dayside atmosphere is nearly fully dissociated and ionized, no molecules had been firmly detected. Here we report the first detection of OH in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b, based on two thermal emission observations with the SPIRou spectrograph, and confirm the presence of Fe. We performed a self-consistent retrieval under chemical equilibrium, constraining elemental abundances and metallicity. A significant thermal inversion layer is confirmed. No significant Doppler shifts were found, and the retrieved equatorial rotation matches the tidally locked value. The oxygen abundance is consistent with solar to supersolar (0.61$_{-0.58}^{+1.19}$ dex), while the C/O ratio and metallicity are subsolar to solar. The low metallicity may indicate a well-mixed envelope and interior. Constraints remain broad, and the data are consistent with supersolar C/O and subsolar O. Combined [C/O] and [O/H] are compatible with formation beyond the water snowline followed by inward migration, though other scenarios cannot be excluded. Volatile-to-refractory ratios, [O/Fe] = 1.25$_{-0.74}^{+0.99}$ dex and [C/Fe] = 0.60$_{-0.74}^{+0.62}$ dex, lie in the solar to supersolar range, but uncertainties limit firm conclusions. Results provide tentative evidence for volatile enrichment. Future high-resolution optical-to-infrared spectra with JWST will enable more precise abundance constraints and stronger insights into UHJ formation and migration. We also advocate a retrieval-guided cross-correlation strategy to reduce risk of missing marginal detections, as illustrated by tentative evidence for CO.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Eccentricities of Planets in the Kinematic Thin and Thick Galactic Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanets is shaped by a combination of dynamical processes, reflecting both formation conditions and long-term evolution. Probing the orbital dynamics of planets in the kinematic thin and thick Galactic disks provides insight into the degree to which stellar and Galactic environmental factors affect planet formation and evolution pathways. The classification of host stars in Galactic kinematic terms constitutes a potentially useful axis for the interpretation of orbital eccentricity, when included together with stellar metallicity and age. Leveraging the photoeccentric effect, we constrain orbital eccentricities for the sample of Kepler planets and candidates orbiting F, G, K and M dwarf stars. With Gaia astrometry, inferred Galactic phase space information, and kinematic disk criteria calibrated on stellar chemical abundances, we probabilistically associate each planet host with the kinematic thin or thick Galactic disks. We then fit the underlying eccentricity distributions for the single- and multi-transit populations. We find that for single-transiting planets, kinematic thick disk planets exhibit higher eccentricities than thin disk planets, yet we find no such difference among multis. We determine that the difference in eccentricity is unlikely to be caused solely by the effects of host stellar metallicity or giant planet occurrence. We situate these findings in the context of known eccentricity relations, including its relationships with planet multiplicity, radius and metallicity. We suggest comprehensive analyses to disentangle these results from the effects of poorly understood star-planet relationships, such as that between stellar age and planetary orbital dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Ultra-short-period Planets under the Influence of the Nearby Planetary Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets, defined as those with orbital periods shorter than 1 day, provide valuable insights into planetary evolution under strong stellar tidal interactions. In this work, we investigate the formation of USP planets in two-planet systems consisting of an inner terrestrial planet accompanied by an outer hot Jupiter (HJ). Our simulation results show USP planets can form through a process driven by secular perturbations from the outer companion, which induce eccentricity excitation, tidal dissipation, and subsequent orbital decay of the inner planet. The probability of USP formation is governed by key factors, including the mass ratio between two planets, their orbital eccentricities, and the tidal dissipation process. 6.7\% of our simulations form USP planets, and USP planets form most efficiently when the mass ratio is around 4 $M_{\oplus}{\rm /}M_{\rm J}$, with the inner planet less than 8 $M_{\oplus}$. Furthermore, the eccentricity of the outer HJ plays a crucial role-moderate eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}&lt;0.1$) favor USP formation, whereas higher eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}&gt;0.1$) enhance the likelihood of orbital instability, often resulting in a lonely HJ. USP planets form more efficiently when the tidal dissipation function of the inner planet is comparable to the values estimated for terrestrial planets in the solar system. Comparison with observed planetary systems reveals that systems with large mass ratios or nearly circular outer planets tend to produce short-period (SP) planets instead of USP planets. Our findings offer a potential explanation for the most commonly observed system architectures, which predominantly feature either an HJ with an inner SP planet or a lonely HJ.</description>

      <title>Technique-agnostic exoplanet demography for the Roman era - I. Testing a retrieval framework using simulated Kepler-like transit datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will unveil for the first time the full architecture of planetary systems across Galactic distances through the discovery of up to 200,000 cool and hot exoplanets using microlensing and transit detection methods. Roman's huge exoplanet haul, and Galactic reach, will require new methods to leverage the full exoplanet demographic content of the combined microlensing and transit samples, given the different sensitivity bias of the techniques to planet and host properties and Galactic location. We present a framework for technique-agnostic exoplanet demography (TAED) that can allow large, multi-technique exoplanet samples to be combined for demographic studies. Our TAED forward modelling and retrieval framework uses parameterised model exoplanet demographic distributions to embed planetary systems within a stellar population synthesis model of the Galaxy, enabling internally consistent forecasts to be made for all detection methods that are based on spatio-kinematic system properties. In this paper, as a first test of the TAED framework, we apply it to simulated transit datasets based on the Kepler Data Release 25 to assess parameter recovery accuracy and method scalability for a single large homogeneous dataset. We find that optimisation using differential evolution provides a computationally scalable framework that gives a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of parameter recovery.</description>

      <title>Polarization at millimeter wavelengths caused by drifting grains in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the evolution of protoplanetary disks, dust grains start to grow, form larger particles, settle to the midplane, and rearrange the disk, mainly by the inward radial drift. Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and, finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized grains.</description>

      <title>Capture and escape from the 2:1 resonance between Ariel and Umbriel in a fast-migration scenario of the Uranian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements suggest that Uranus may exhibit a higher tidal dissipation than previously assumed. This enhanced dissipation leads to a faster orbital migration of its five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Consequently, resonant encounters that have always been discarded in previous works need to be included. In particular, Ariel's fast migration implies that the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance with Umbriel is extremely likely and it could have occurred in recent times. Capture into this strong resonance would have induced significant tidal heating within Ariel, possibly explaining its resurfacing. Therefore, in this work, we aim to explore the orbital history of the Uranian moons in a context of fast tidal migration, including the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel. For small initial eccentricities, we confirm that the moons are always captured into this resonance. As the system is not currently involved in any mean motion resonance, we investigated possible dynamical mechanisms for exiting the 2:1 resonance. We show that the resonance could have been broken by a further resonant encounter with Titania. We analyzed the crossing of the 4:2:1 and 3:2:1 resonant chains, and looked for the parameter space where the probability of escaping the resonance is maximized. Taking a dissipative parameter of Ariel $k_{2,2}/Q_2&lt;10^{-3}$, the passage through the 3:2:1 resonance succeeds in disrupting the 2:1 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance in more than $60\%$ of our numerical experiments. A fraction of our simulations results in final low eccentricities and inclinations, which can eventually match the current orbital features of the system. As the proposed orbital history requires specific ranges of the dissipative parameters for the system, future Uranus mission data will validate (or disprove) this scenario.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves multiple physical processes, including dust growth and fragmentation, the streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find only appropriate combinations -- fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Imaging of the Warm Dust Component of the Epsilon Eridani Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby, solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO program. Multi-wavelength images from 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu m$ show a smooth dust distribution with no evidence of sculpting by massive planets outside of 5 au. Maps of the color temperature and opacity constrain the dust properties while radiative transfer modeling of a warm dust component traces the interaction between the debris disk and Epsilon Eri b ($\sim$3.5 au). Dynamical and collisional modeling further shows that the disk morphology is dominated by dust produced in the outer planetesimal belt ($\sim 70 \, au$) moving inward via stellar wind drag. We confirm the presence of a disk interior to the Epsilon Eri b orbit first detected from mid-IR interferometry. Drag dominated inner disk regions have also been observed around Vega and Fomalhaut hinting at the diversity of asteroid belt analogs.</description>

      <title>Induction Heating in Super-Earths: A Thermochemical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic induction heating has recently been proposed as an important internal heat source in the mantles of rocky exoplanets. However, its dependence on planetary interior properties remains poorly constrained. Here we construct electrical conductivity profiles for super-Earth mantles considering different temperatures and compositions, and evaluate induction heating in super-Earth mantles in both solid and partially molten states. We find that high mantle temperature, iron content, and melt fraction all suppress the overall induction heating efficiency due to increased mantle conductivity and magnetic shielding. In GJ 486b, induction heating likely exceeds both radiogenic heating and tidal heating, driving persistent surface volcanism and early volatile depletion, whereas HD 3167b and GJ 357b experience insignificant induction heating due to weak stellar magnetic fields. Our findings highlight induction heating as a critical factor in the thermal and atmospheric evolution of close-in super-Earths around magnetically active stars.</description>

      <title>Colors of Life in the Clouds: Biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms as a new signature to detect life on planets like Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan &amp; E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.</description>

      <title>Finding rare classes in large datasets: the case of polluted white dwarfs from Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission's third data release recorded low-resolution spectra for about 100 000 white dwarf candidates. A small subset of these spectra show evidence of characteristic broad Ca II absorption features, implying the accretion of rocky material by so-called polluted white dwarfs -- important probes of the composition of exoplanetary material. Several supervised and unsupervised data-intensive methods have recently been applied to identify polluted white dwarfs from the Gaia spectra. We present a comparison of these methods, along with the first application of $t$-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ($t$SNE) to this dataset. We find that $t$SNE outperforms the similar technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), isolating over 50% more high-confidence polluted candidates, including 39 new candidates which are not selected by any other method investigated and which have not been observed at higher resolution. Supervised methods benefit greatly from data labels provided by earlier works, selecting many known polluted white dwarfs which are missed by unsupervised methods. Our work provides a useful case study in the selection of members of rare classes from a large, sporadically labelled dataset, with applications across astronomy.</description>

      <title>Early Stellar Flybys are Unlikely: Improved Constraints from Sednoids and Large-$q$ TNOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs) characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i&lt;30^\circ$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origin of Hot Jupiters with Atmospheric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters. We report on the detectability of such signatures and further provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common moment-based radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of inward and outward vertical fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we introduced a half-moment (HM) closure that integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres, thereby suppressing beam interactions along a fixed spatial direction. We derived a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replaced this closure with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding with it in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implemented HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We tested these methods in numerical benchmarks such as computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing our results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The HM closure correctly reproduces the diffusion limit and prevents crossing flux interactions in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations, our multigroup HM method closely matches midplane temperature distributions obtained with classical MC methods. While the M1 closure produces midplane temperatures 44% higher than MC with one frequency group and 21% higher with 22 groups, HM reduces this discrepancy to 6% with 22 groups. Even with just three groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%. Our results show that combining HM with a multigroup treatment yields more realistic disk temperatures than M1, particularly in optically thick regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>
