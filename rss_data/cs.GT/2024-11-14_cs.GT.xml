      <title>Surprisingly Popular Voting for Concentric Rank-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important problem on social information sites is the recovery of ground truth from individual reports when the experts are in the minority. The wisdom of the crowd, i.e. the collective opinion of a group of individuals fails in such a scenario. However, the surprisingly popular (SP) algorithm~\cite{prelec2017solution} can recover the ground truth even when the experts are in the minority, by asking the individuals to report additional prediction reports--their beliefs about the reports of others. Several recent works have extended the surprisingly popular algorithm to an equivalent voting rule (SP-voting) to recover the ground truth ranking over a set of $m$ alternatives. However, we are yet to fully understand when SP-voting can recover the ground truth ranking, and if so, how many samples (votes and predictions) it needs. We answer this question by proposing two rank-order models and analyzing the sample complexity of SP-voting under these models. In particular, we propose concentric mixtures of Mallows and Plackett-Luce models with $G (\ge 2)$ groups. Our models generalize previously proposed concentric mixtures of Mallows models with $2$ groups, and we highlight the importance of $G &gt; 2$ groups by identifying three distinct groups (expert, intermediate, and non-expert) from existing datasets. Next, we provide conditions on the parameters of the underlying models so that SP-voting can recover ground-truth rankings with high probability, and also derive sample complexities under the same. We complement the theoretical results by evaluating SP-voting on simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair and Efficient Public Transportation: A Bus Stop Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stylized formal model of public transportation, where a set of agents need to travel along a given road, and there is a bus that runs the length of this road. Each agent has a left terminal and a right terminal between which they wish to travel; they can walk all the way, or walk to/from the nearest stop and use the bus for the rest of their journey. The bus can make a fixed number of stops, and the planner needs to select locations for these stops. We study notions of efficiency and fairness for this setting. First, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a solution that minimizes the total travel time; our approach can capture further extensions of the base model, such as more general cost functions or existing infrastructure. Second, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs solutions with provable fairness guarantees (such as a variant of the justified representation axiom or $2$-approximate core) as long as the agents' costs only depend on the distance they need to walk. Our simulations indicate that our algorithm almost always outputs fair solutions, even for parameter regimes that do not admit theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>DecentPeeR: A Self-Incentivised &amp; Inclusive Decentralized Peer Review System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review, as a widely used practice to ensure the quality and integrity of publications, lacks a well-defined and common mechanism to self-incentivize virtuous behavior across all the conferences and journals. This is because information about reviewer efforts and author feedback typically remains local to a single venue, while the same group of authors and reviewers participate in the publication process across many venues. Previous attempts to incentivize the reviewing process assume that the quality of reviews and papers authored correlate for the same person, or they assume that the reviewers can receive physical rewards for their work. In this paper, we aim to keep track of reviewing and authoring efforts by users (who review and author) across different venues while ensuring self-incentivization. We show that our system, DecentPeeR, incentivizes reviewers to behave according to the rules, i.e., it has a unique Nash equilibrium in which virtuous behavior is rewarded.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture on Group Decision Accuracy in Voter Networks through the Regularized Incomplete Beta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conjecture on the regularized incomplete beta function in the context of majority decision systems modeled through a voter framework. We examine a network where voters interact, with some voters fixed in their decisions while others are free to change their states based on the influence of their neighbors. We demonstrate that as the number of free voters increases, the probability of selecting the correct majority outcome converges to $1-I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta)$, where $I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta)$ is the regularized incomplete beta function. The conjecture posits that when $\alpha &gt; \beta$, $1-I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta) &gt; \alpha/(\alpha+\beta)$, meaning the group's decision accuracy exceeds that of an individual voter. We provide partial results, including a proof for integer values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and support the general case using a probability bound. This work extends Condorcet's Jury Theorem by incorporating voter dependence driven by network dynamics, showing that group decision accuracy can exceed individual accuracy under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Opinion Formation on Networks with Linear Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider public health officials aiming to spread awareness about a new vaccine in a community interconnected by a social network. How can they distribute information with minimal resources, so as to avoid polarization and ensure community-wide convergence of opinion? To tackle such challenges, we initiate the study of sample complexity of opinion convergence in networks. Our framework is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard the opinion of each agent as a data-derived model, unlike previous works that treat opinions as data-independent scalars. The opinion model for every agent is initially learned from its local samples and evolves game-theoretically as all agents communicate with neighbors and revise their models towards an equilibrium. Our focus is on the sample complexity needed to ensure that the opinions converge to an equilibrium such that the final model of every agent has low generalization error.
  Our paper has two main technical results. First, we present a novel polynomial time optimization framework to quantify the total sample complexity for arbitrary networks, when the underlying learning problem is (generalized) linear regression. Second, we leverage this optimization to study the network gain which measures the improvement of sample complexity when learning over a network compared to that in isolation. Towards this end, we derive network gain bounds for various network classes including cliques, star graphs, and random regular graphs. Additionally, our framework provides a method to study sample distribution within the network, suggesting that it is sufficient to allocate samples inversely to the degree. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world networks strongly support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Conflux-PSRO: Effectively Leveraging Collective Advantages in Policy Space Response Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) with policy population construction has been demonstrated as an effective method for approximating Nash Equilibrium (NE) in zero-sum games. Existing studies have attempted to improve diversity in policy space, primarily by incorporating diversity regularization into the Best Response (BR). However, these methods cause the BR to deviate from maximizing rewards, easily resulting in a population that favors diversity over performance, even when diversity is not always necessary. Consequently, exploitability is difficult to reduce until policies are fully explored, especially in complex games. In this paper, we propose Conflux-PSRO, which fully exploits the diversity of the population by adaptively selecting and training policies at state-level. Specifically, Conflux-PSRO identifies useful policies from the existing population and employs a routing policy to select the most appropriate policies at each decision point, while simultaneously training them to enhance their effectiveness. Compared to the single-policy BR of traditional PSRO and its diversity-improved variants, the BR generated by Conflux-PSRO not only leverages the specialized expertise of diverse policies but also synergistically enhances overall performance. Our experiments on various environments demonstrate that Conflux-PSRO significantly improves the utility of BRs and reduces exploitability compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Equitable Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of how auction design affects the division of surplus among buyers. We propose a parsimonious measure for equity and apply it to the family of standard auctions for homogeneous goods. Our surplus-equitable mechanism is efficient, Bayesian-Nash incentive compatible, and achieves surplus parity among winners ex-post. The uniform-price auction is equity-optimal if and only if buyers have a pure common value. Against intuition, the pay-as-bid auction is not always preferred in terms of equity if buyers have pure private values. In auctions with price mixing between pay-as-bid and uniform prices, we provide prior-free bounds on the equity-preferred pricing rule under a common regularity condition on signals.</description>
