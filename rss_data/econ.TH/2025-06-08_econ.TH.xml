      <title>Propose or Vote: A simple Democratic Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simple democratic procedure. In a first stage, all members of a polity decide whether to apply for proposal-making or later vote on proposals made in the second stage. This procedure is called Propose or Vote (PoV). With appropriate default points and majority voting over two randomly selected proposals, the PoV procedure can implement the Condorcet winner with only one round of voting if a Condorcet winner exists. We explore ways to establish uniqueness, alternative voting procedures over the selected alternatives, and the application to elections. In the latter case, agents can decide whether to stand for election to an office or to vote on the set of candidates.</description>

      <title>Longer Lists Yield Better Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools, each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would favor all agents.</description>

      <title>On the merit principle in strategic exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New fairness notions in align with the merit principle are proposed for designing exchange rules. We show that, for an obviously strategy-proof, efficient and individually rational rule, an upper bound of fairness attainable is that, if two agents possess objects considered the best by all others divided into two equal groups, then at least one receives her favorite object. Notably, it is not possible to guarantee them both having favorites. Our results thus indicate an unambiguous trade-off between incentives and fairness in the design of exchange rules.</description>
