      <title>Sharp Nonuniqueness in the Transport Equation with Sobolev Velocity Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a divergence-free vector field ${\bf u} \in L^\infty_t W^{1,p}_x(\mathbb R^d)$ and a nonnegative initial datum $\rho_0 \in L^r$, the celebrated DiPerna--Lions theory established the uniqueness of the weak solution in the class of $L^\infty_t L^r_x$ densities for $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{r} \leq 1$. This range was later improved in [BCDL21] to $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{d-1}{dr} \leq 1$. We prove that this range is sharp by providing a counterexample to uniqueness when $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{d-1}{dr} &gt; 1$.
  To this end, we introduce a novel flow mechanism. It is not based on convex integration, which has provided a non-optimal result in this context, nor on purely self-similar techniques, but shares features of both, such as a local (discrete) self similar nature and an intermittent space-frequency localization.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport on gas networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper models gas networks as metric graphs, with isothermal Euler equations at the edges, Kirchhoff's law at interior vertices and time-(in)dependent boundary conditions at boundary vertices. For this setup, a generalized $p$-Wasserstein metric in a dynamic formulation is introduced and utilized to derive $p$-Wasserstein gradient flows, specifically focusing on the non-standard case $p = 3$.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time maximal regularity for the Cauchy problem of the heat equation in BMO and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish global-in-time maximal regularity for the Cauchy problem of the classical heat equation $\partial_t u(x,t)-\Delta u(x,t)=f(x,t)$ with $u(x,0)=0$ in a certain $\rm BMO$ setting, which improves the local-in-time result initially proposed by Ogawa and Shimizu in \cite{OS, OS2}. In further developing our method originally formulated for the heat equation, we obtain analogous global ${\rm BMO}$-maximal regularity associated to the Schr\"odinger operator $\mathcal L=-\Delta+V$, where the nonnegative potential $V$ belongs to the reverse H\"older class ${\rm RH}_q$ for some $q&gt; n/2$. This extension includes several inhomogeneous estimates as ingredients, such as Carleson-type estimates for the external forces.
  Our new methodology is to exploit elaborate heat kernel estimates, along with matched space-time decomposition on the involving integral-type structure of maximal operators, as well as some global techniques such as those from de Simon's work and Schur's lemma. One crucial trick is to utilize the mean oscillation therein to contribute a higher and necessary decay order for global-in-time estimates.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational form of the Neumann problem for the Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonvariational setting for the Neumann problem for the Poisson equation for solutions that are H\"{o}lder continuous and that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. We introduce a distributional normal derivative on the boundary for the solutions that extends that for harmonic functions that has been introduced in a previous paper and we solve the nonvariational Neumann problem for data in the interior with a negative Schauder exponent and for data on the boundary that belong to a certain space of distributions on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the attractor for nonautonomous reaction-diffusion equations with discontinuous nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of a nonautonomous differential inclusion modeling a reaction-diffusion equation with a discontinuous nonlinearity. We obtain first several properties concerning the uniqueness and regularity of non-negative solutions. Then we study the structure of the pullback attractor in the positive cone, showing that it consists of the zero solution, the unique positive nonautonomous equilibrium and the heteroclinic connections between them, which can be expressed in terms of the solutions of an associated linear problem. Finally, we analyze the relationship of the pullback attractor with the uniform, the cocycle and the skew product semiflow attractors.</description>

      <title>Some Comparison Results for First-Order Hamilton-Jacobi Equations and Second-Order Fully Nonlinear Parabolic Equations with Ventcell Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider fully nonlinear, possibly degenerate, parabolic equations associated with Ventcell boundary conditions in bounded or unbounded, smooth domains. We first analyze the exact form of such boundary conditions in general domains in order that the notion of viscosity solutions make sense. Then we prove general comparison results under natural assumptions on the nonlinearities, assuming only that the equation is either coercive (first-order case) or strictly elliptic (second-order case) in the normal direction in a neighborhood of the boundary. Our method is inspired by the "twin blow-up method" of Forcadel-Imbert-Monneau and ideas of Lions-Souganidis which we extend to the framework of Ventcell boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the number of bound states for fractional Schr{\"o}dinger operators with critical and super-critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number $N_{&lt;0}(H_s)$ of negative eigenvalues, counting multiplicities, of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $H_s=(-\Delta)^s-V(x)$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for any $d\ge1$ and $s\ge d/2$. We prove a bound on $N_{&lt;0}(H_s)$ which depends on $s-d/2$ being either an integer or not, the critical case $s=d/2$ requiring a further analysis. Our proof relies on a splitting of the Birman-Schwinger operator associated to this spectral problem into low- and high-energies parts, a projection of the low-energies part onto a suitable subspace, and, in the critical case $s=d/2$, a Cwikel-type estimate in the weak trace ideal $\mathcal{L}^{2,\infty}$ to handle the high-energies part.</description>

      <title>Complex pattern formation governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-Swift-Hohenberg system: Analysis and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Cahn-Hilliard-Swift-Hohenberg system, focusing on a three-species chemical mixture subject to physical constraints on volume fractions. The resulting system leads to complex patterns involving a separation into phases as typical of the Cahn-Hilliard equation and small scale stripes and dots as seen in the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We introduce singular potentials of logarithmic type to enhance the model's accuracy in adhering to essential physical constraints. The paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions within this extended framework. The insights gained contribute to a deeper understanding of phase separation in complex systems, with potential applications in materials science and related fields. We introduce a stable finite element approximation based on an obstacle formulation. Subsequent numerical simulations demonstrate that the model allows for complex structures as seen in pigment patterns of animals and in porous polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Elliptic fourth-order operators with Wentzell boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bounded domains $\Omega$ with Lipschitz boundary $\Gamma$, we investigate boundary value problems for elliptic operators with variable coefficients of fourth order subject to Wentzell (or dynamic) boundary conditions. Using form methods, we begin by showing general results for an even wider class of operators defined via two (intertwined) quadratic forms by defining very abstract concepts of weak traces. Even in this general setting, we prove generation of an analytic semigroup on the product space $L^2(\Omega) \times L^2(\Gamma)$. Using recent results concerning weak co-normal traces, we apply our abstract theory to the elliptic fourth-order case and are able to fully characterize the domain in terms of Sobolev regularity, also obtaining H\"older-regularity of solutions. Finally, we also discuss asymptotic behavior and (eventual) positivity.</description>

      <title>Spacelike initial data for black hole stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct initial data suitable for the Kerr stability conjecture, that is, solutions to the constraint equations on a spacelike hypersurface with boundary entering the black hole horizon that are arbitrarily decaying perturbations of a Kerr initial data set. This results from a more general perturbative construction on any asymptotically flat initial data set with the topology of $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{r&lt;1\}$ enjoying some analyticity near and at the boundary. In particular, we design a suitable mixed boundary condition for the elliptic operator of the conformal method in order to exclude the Killing initial data sets (KIDS).</description>

      <title>Master equations with indefinite nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following indefinite fully fractional heat equation involving the master operator \begin{equation*} (\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = x_1u^p(x,t)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \R^n\times\R , \end{equation*} where $s\in(0,1)$, and $-\infty &lt; p &lt; \infty$. Under mild conditions, we prove that there is no positive bounded solutions. To this end, we first show that the solutions are strictly increasing along $x_1$ direction by employing the direct method of moving planes. Then by constructing an unbounded sub-solution, we derive the nonexistence of bounded solutions.
  To circumvent the difficulties caused by the fully fractional master operator, we introduced some new ideas and novel approaches that, as we believe, will become useful tool in studying a variety of other fractional elliptic and parabolic problems.</description>

Our target is operators of type (0, 0) for which a differentiation does not make any decay of the associated symbol. Analogous results for operators of type (\rho, \rho), 0 &lt; \rho &lt; 1, appeared in an earlier work of the authors, but a different approach is given for \rho = 0</description>

      <title>An informal account of recent results on initial-boundary value problems for systems of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims at providing a rather informal and hopefully accessible overview of the fairly long and technical work [4]. In that paper, the authors established new global-in-time existence results for admissible solutions of nonlinear systems of conservation laws defined in domains with boundaries. The main novelty in [4] is that the solution is constructed by taking into account the underlying viscous mechanism, which is relevant because, in the case of initial-boundary value problems, different viscous approximations yield in general different limits. This note will frame the analysis of [4] in the relevant context, compare the main result with the previous existing literature, and touch upon the most innnovative technical points of the proof.</description>

Abstract: The present survey is devoted to results on Trudinger-Moser inequalities in two dimension. We give a brief overview of the history of these celebrated inequalities and, starting from the geometric problem that motivated Moser's original work, we discuss the connection between Onofri's inequality for the unit sphere and sharp inequalities on Euclidean domains. Finally, we present recent results and new insights into nonlocal interaction energy functionals in two dimension, involving logarithmic kernels.</description>

      <title>Second radial eigenfunctions to a fractional Dirichlet problem and uniqueness for a semilinear equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the shape of radial second Dirichlet eigenfunctions of fractional Schr\"odinger type operators of the form $(-\Delta)^s +V$ in the unit ball $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a nondecreasing radial potential $V$. Specifically, we show that the eigenspace corresponding to the second radial eigenvalue is simple and spanned by an eigenfunction $u$ which changes sign precisely once in the radial variable and does not have zeroes anywhere else in $B$. Moreover, by a new Hopf type lemma for supersolutions to a class of degenerate mixed boundary value problems, we show that $u$ has a nonvanishing fractional boundary derivative on $\partial B$. We apply this result to prove uniqueness and nondegeneracy of positive ground state solutions to the problem $(-\Delta)^s u+\lambda u=u^p$ on ${B}$, $\; u=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus B$. Here $s\in (0,1)$, $\lambda\geq 0$ and $p&gt;1$ is strictly smaller than the critical Sobolev exponent.</description>

  We prove the existence of entropy solutions in the fractional $BV$ spaces ${W}_p(\mathbb{R})$ of functions of bounded $p$-variation, $p \in [1,\frac{3}{2}]$, for small initial data.</description>

Abstract: We prove global regularity and study the infinite Prandtl number limit of temperature patches for the 2D non-diffusive Boussinesq system with dissipation in the full subcritical regime. The temperature satisfies a transport equation and the temperature initial data are given in the form of non-constant patches. Our first main result is a persistence of regularity of the patches globally in time. More precisely, we prove that if the boundary of the initial temperature patch lies in $C^{k+\gamma}$ with $k\geq 1$ and $\gamma\in(0,1)$ then this initial regularity is preserved for all time. Importantly, our proof is robust enough to show uniform dependence on the Prandtl number in some cases. This result solves a question in Khor and Xu \cite{KX22} concerning the global control of the curvature of the patch boundary. Besides, by studying the limit when the Prandtl number goes to infinity, we find that the patch solutions to the 2D Boussinesq-Navier-Stokes system in the torus converge to the unique patch solutions of the (fractional) Stokes-transport equation and that the $C^{k+\gamma}$ regularity of the patch boundary is globally preserved. This allows us to extend the $C^{k+\gamma}$ persistence result of Grayer II \cite{Gray23} from the range $k\in \{0,1,2\}$ to the full range $k\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>On the Three-dimensional Nernst-Planck-Boussinesq System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a three-dimensional Nernst-Planck-Boussinesq (NPB) system that describes ionic electrodiffusion in an incompressible viscous fluid. This new model incorporates variational temperature and is forced by buoyancy force stemming from temperature and salinity fluctuations, enhancing its generality and realism. The electromigration term in the NPB system displays a complex nonlinear structure influenced by the reciprocal of the temperature that distinguishes its mathematical aspects from other electrodiffusion models studied in the literature. We address the global existence of weak solutions to the NPB system on the three-dimensional torus for large initial data. In addition, we study the long-time dynamics of these weak solutions and the associated relative entropies and establish their exponential decay in time to steady states.</description>

      <title>Influence of a slow moving vehicle on traffic: Well-posedness and approximation for a mildly non-local model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a macroscopic model that describes the influence of a slow moving large vehicle on road traffic. The model consists of a scalar conservation law with a non-local constraint on the flux. The constraint level depends on the trajectory of the slower vehicle which is given by an ODE depending on the downstream traffic density. After proving well-posedness, we first build a finite volume scheme and prove its convergence, and then investigate numerically this model by performing a series of tests. In particular, the link with the limit local problem of [M. L. Delle Monache and P. Goatin, J. Differ. Equ. 257 (2014), 4015--4029] is explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Learning equilibria in Cournot mean field games of controls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Cournot mean field games of controls, a model originally developed for the production of an exhaustible resource by a continuum of producers. We prove uniqueness of the solution under general assumptions on the price function. Then, we prove convergence of a learning algorithm which gives existence of a solution to the mean field games system. The learning algorithm is implemented with a suitable finite difference discretization to get a numerical method to the solution. We supplement our theoretical analysis with several numerical examples and illustrate the impacts of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the three dimensional Muskat problem in the critical Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the 3D stable Muskat problem is globally well-posed in the critical Sobolev space $\dot H^2 \cap \dot W^{1,\infty}$ provided that the semi-norm $\Vert f_0 \Vert_{\dot H^{2}}$ is small enough. Consequently, this allows the Lipschitz semi-norm to be arbitrarily large. The proof is based on a new formulation of the 3D Muskat problem that allows to capture the hidden oscillatory nature of the problem. The latter formulation allows to prove the $\dot H^{2}$ {\emph{a priori}} estimates. In the literature, all the known global existence results for the 3D Muskat problem are for small slopes (less than 1). This is the first arbitrary large slope theorem for the 3D stable Muskat problem.</description>

      <title>Uniform in gravity estimates for 2D water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 2D gravity water waves equation on an infinite domain. We prove a local wellposedness result which allows interfaces with corners and cusps as initial data and which is such that the time of existence of solutions is uniform even as the gravity parameter $g \to 0$. For $g&gt;0$, we prove an improved blow up criterion for these singular solutions and we also prove an existence result for $g = 0$. Moreover the energy estimate used to prove this result is scaling invariant.
  As an application of this energy estimate, we then consider the water wave equation with no gravity where the fluid domain is homeomorphic to the disc. We prove a local wellposedness result which allows for interfaces with angled crests and cusps as initial data and then by a rigidity argument, we show that there exists initial interfaces with angled crests for which the energy blows up in finite time, thereby proving the optimality of this local wellposedness result. For smooth initial data, this local wellposedness result gives a longer time of existence as compared to previous results when the initial velocity is small and we also improve upon the blow up criterion.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions to the Landau-Coulomb equation in $L^{3/2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Landau equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Coulomb potential and initial data in polynomially weighted $L^{3/2}$. We show that there exists a smooth solution that is bounded for all positive times. The proof is based on short-time regularization estimates for the Fisher information, which, combined with the recent result of Guillen and Silvestre, yields the existence of a global-in-time smooth solution. Additionally, if the initial data belongs to $L^p$ with $p&gt;3/2$, there is a unique solution.
  At the crux of the result is a new $\varepsilon$-regularity criterion in the spirit of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem: a solution which is small in weighted $L^{3/2}$ is regular. Although the $L^{3/2}$ norm is a critical quantity for the Landau-Coulomb equation, using this norm to measure the regularity of solutions presents significant complications. For instance, the $L^{3/2}$ norm alone is not enough to control the $L^\infty$ norm of the competing reaction and diffusion coefficients. These analytical challenges caused prior methods relying on the parabolic structure of the Landau-Coulomb to break down.
  Our new framework is general enough to handle slowly decaying and singular initial data, and provides the first proof of global well-posedness for the Landau-Coulomb equation with rough initial data.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev spaces on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the canonical Hilbert energy $H^{s/2}(M)$ on a Riemannian manifold for $s\in(0,2)$, with particular focus on the case of closed manifolds. Several equivalent definitions for this energy and the fractional Laplacian on a manifold are given, and they are shown to be identical up to explicit multiplicative constants. Moreover, the precise behavior of the kernel associated with the singular integral definition of the fractional Laplacian is obtained through an in-depth study of the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold. Furthermore, a monotonicity formula for stationary points of functionals of the type $$ \mathcal E(v)=[v]^2_{H^{s/2}(M)}+\int_M F(v) \, dV \,, \,\,\, F \ge 0 \,, $$ is given, which includes, in particular, the case of nonlocal $s$-minimal surfaces. Finally, we prove some estimates for the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension problem, which are of general interest.
  This work is motivated by a recent article by the authors, which proves the nonlocal version of a conjecture of Yau.</description>

      <title>Minimisers of supremal functionals and mass-minimising 1-currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study vector-valued functions that minimise the $L^\infty$-norm of their derivatives for prescribed boundary data. We construct a vector-valued, mass minimising $1$-current (i.e., a generalised geodesic) in the domain such that all solutions of the problem coincide on its support. Furthermore, this current can be interpreted as a streamline of the solutions. It also has maximal support among all $1$-currents with certain properties.
  The construction relies on a $p$-harmonic approximation. In the case of scalar-valued functions, it is closely related to a construction of Evans and Yu. We therefore obtain an extension of their theory.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we apply the viscosity solutions theory for integro-differential equations to the \emph{one-phase} Muskat equation (also known as the Hele-Shaw problem with gravity). We prove global well-posedness for the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equation with bounded, uniformly continuous initial data, in all dimensions.</description>
