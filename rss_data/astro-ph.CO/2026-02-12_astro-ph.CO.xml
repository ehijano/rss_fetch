      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

      <title>Massive stars as gravitationally lensed transients -- Insights on the high-mass initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust stellar initial mass function (IMF) is crucial in any studies related to star formation. However, the direct measurement of the stellar IMF is confined to the local universe, limited by the resolving power of telescopes. Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies. In this proceeding, I summarize the contributed talk given at IAUS402 entitled the same as this contribution and highlight some key results, which currently show no evidence for a top-heavy IMF in $z \approx 1$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\Lambda$CDM: fundamental constants as cosmological observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological tensions pose difficulties for $\Lambda$CDM. Forthcoming facilities will be able to check whether these tensions result from systematic effects or indeed with the $\Lambda$CDM model itself. However, these new data will primarily probe gravitational interactions and provide only limited information about non-gravitational interactions. Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $\alpha$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of $\alpha$ measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>New constraints on cosmic anisotropy from galaxy clusters using an improved dipole fitting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we attempted to apply the dipole fitting (DF) method to galaxy clusters to search for cosmic anisotropic signals, and to construct a statistical isotropic analysis scheme for them. Compared to Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), the galaxy clusters offer a significant advantage in terms of spatial distribution. This advantage makes the anisotropic signals obtained from them more reliable. From 313 galaxy clusters (Chandra + XMM-Newton), we find two preferred directions (l, b) = (${257.82^{\circ}}_{-52.88}^{+58.01}$, $-31.30{^{\circ}}_{-39.46}^{+35.92}$) and ($80.89{^{\circ}}_{-52.46}^{+60.97}$, $31.75{^{\circ}}_{-40.16}^{+35.19}$). The former to a direction where the universe is expanding at a faster rate than the surrounding area, while the latter to a slower rate of expansion. The corresponding magnitude of anisotropy is $|A|$ = 5.2 $\sim$ 5.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The results of statistical isotropy analyses give $\sim$1.0$\sigma$ confidence level. From the reanalyses based on the subsamples including Chandra, XMM-Newton, low reshift (LR, $z &lt; 0.10$), high redshift (HR, $z &gt; 0.10$) datasets, we find that the observation equipment and sample redshift can affect the preferred direction, anisotropic magnitude, and statistical significance of anisotropy. The XMM-Newton dataset gives a statistical significance of 2.26$\sigma$ (Mock) and 2.86$\sigma$ (Iso) which are much higher than that from Chandra and the total datasets. The magnitude of anisotropy $|A|$ from HR dataset is larger than that from LR dataset. Overall, our results indicate the presence of anisotropic signals in galaxy clusters, which must be taken seriously. Further test is still needed to better understand these signals.</description>

      <title>Beyond thermal approximations: Precise cosmological bounds on Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive updated cosmological bounds on light axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to leptons or photons, using a full phase-space treatment of their production from the primordial thermal plasma. The ALP phase-space distribution, obtained by solving the momentum-dependent Boltzmann equation for the relevant production processes, is consistently propagated into the computation of cosmological observables, allowing us to assess the impact of non-thermal spectral distortions on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Using state-of-the-art measurements of the cosmic microwave background from Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, complemented with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis determinations of primordial deuterium and helium abundances, we obtain the following 95\% credible limits on the ALP decay constant: $f_a &gt; 1.63 \times 10^6 \, {\rm GeV}$, $9.41 \times 10^6 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $8.06 \times 10^4 \, {\rm GeV}$ for ALPs coupled to electrons, muons and taus, respectively. For the ALP-photon coupling we find $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 1.98 \times 10^{-8} \, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Including baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument mildly relaxes the constraints, in line with previous analyses of extra relativistic degrees of freedom. Finally, we present forecasts for the LiteBIRD$+$Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD$+$CMB-HD configurations, discussing the importance of an exact phase-space treatment for robust cosmological bounds on ALP interactions.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Atomic Dark Matter: First-Principles Recombination Rates and Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal atomic dark matter with its distinctive cooling mechanisms offers an instructive framework for understanding the potential impact of dark matter on small-scale structure formation and early cosmology. The model consists of two fermions with opposite charges under a hidden Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)_{D}$ and masses $m_{p_{D}}$ and $m_{e_{D}}$, respectively. Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $\alpha_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m_{e_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m_{p_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $\alpha_{D}\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings. Combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck and ACT with BAO and Pantheon+ data, we place new constraints on the atomic dark matter parameter space, identifying regions where acoustic damping and recombination dynamics leave observable imprints on the CMB.</description>

      <title>Gravitational scalar production with a generic reheating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational production of decoupled scalars during inflationary and post-inflationary phases is efficient and can lead to over-production. We study this production with various reheating scenarios such as a generic power-law inflaton potential $V_{\rm inf}\propto \phi^k$ as well as a multi-stage reheating scenario. We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $\lambda_s$, the mass $m_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k &lt; 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k &gt; 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar. In multi-stage reheating, we show that the enhancement/dilution effect of subsequent reheating phases factorises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that scalar field fluctuations alone can drive cosmic acceleration, provided the universe is spatially closed and the Compton wavelength of the field exceeds the radius of curvature. This mechanism may open new perspectives on inflation and dark energy, which could arise from a gas of sufficiently light bosons in a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Light to Heavy, Brief to Eternal: An Axion for Every Occasion (in the Early Universe)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early universe grants access to energy scales far beyond those achievable in terrestrial experiments and allows unstable Standard Model particles to play an active dynamical role. In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the correlation between cosmic voids and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection at a median redshift $z = 2.49$ of large-scale matter flows around cosmic voids. Voids are identified within a tomographic map of large-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) transmissions, built from the eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ forest sample in the SDSS Stripe 82 field. We measure the imprint of flows around voids, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD), with a statistical significance of $8\,\sigma$. The observed quadrupole of the void-forest cross-correlation is described by a linear RSD model. The derived RSD parameter of the Ly$\alpha$ forest around voids is $\beta = 1.21 \pm 0.18$. Our model accounts for the tomographic effect induced by the Ly$\alpha$ data being located along parallel quasar lines of sight. This work presents a novel approach to observing the growth of cosmic structures at redshifts currently inaccessible to galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation cosmological analyses. Built on the Goku $N$-body simulation suite and the T2N-MusE emulation framework, GokuNEmu predicts the matter power spectrum with $\sim 0.5 \%$ average accuracy for redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 3$ and scales $0.006 \leq k/(h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) \leq 10$. The emulator models a 10D parameter space that extends beyond $\Lambda$CDM to include dynamical dark energy (characterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$), massive neutrinos ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and running of the spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Its broad parameter coverage, particularly for the extensions, makes it the only matter power spectrum emulator capable of testing recent dynamical dark energy constraints from DESI. In addition, it requires only $\sim $2 milliseconds to predict a single cosmology on a laptop, orders of magnitude faster than existing emulators. These features make GokuNEmu a uniquely powerful tool for interpreting observational data from upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope, and CSST.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of neural networks for multifidelity cosmological emulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation-based emulators are essential for interpreting cosmological survey data down to nonlinear scales. Multifidelity emulation techniques reduce simulation costs by combining high- and low-fidelity data, but traditional regression methods such as Gaussian processes struggle with scalability in sample size and dimensionality. In this work, we present T2N-MusE, a neural network framework characterized by (i) a novel 2-step multifidelity architecture, (ii) a 2-stage Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, (iii) a 2-phase $k$-fold training strategy, and (iv) a per-$z$ principal component analysis strategy. We apply T2N-MusE to selected data from the Goku simulation suite, covering a 10-dimensional cosmological parameter space, and build emulators for the matter power spectrum over a range of redshifts with different configurations. We find the emulators outperform our earlier Gaussian process models significantly and demonstrate that each of these techniques is efficient in training neural networks or/and effective in improving generalization accuracy. We observe a reduction in the mean error by more than a factor of five and in the worst-case error by approximately a factor of eight in leave-one-out cross-validation, relative to previous work. This framework has been used to build the most powerful emulator for the matter power spectrum, GokuNEmu, and will also be used to construct emulators for other statistics in future.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Prediction from the joint observation of MeerKAT and CSST at $z$ = 0.4 $\sim$ 1.2</title>

Abstract: Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information. This work presents a cross-correlation analysis between MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity mapping and Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys in $z=0.4\sim1.2$, which will share a survey area of several thousand square degrees. Utilizing Jiutian-1G cosmological simulation, we simulate the observational data of MeerKAT and CSST with survey areas from $\sim1600$ to $600$ deg$^2$ at $z=0.5$, 0.7, and 1. The effects of beam pattern, polarization leakage, and different foregrounds in the MeerKAT HI intensity mapping are considered in the simulation. After employing foreground removal with the principal component analysis (PCA) method and performing signal compensation, we derive the cross-power spectra of MeerKAT and CSST. We perform the joint constraint using the CSST galaxy auto-power spectra and MeerKAT-CSST cross-power spectra with the least-squares fitting method. The constraint results show that, in the simulated survey area, the relative accuracy can achieve $6\%\sim 8\%$ for the parameter products $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}b_{g}r_{\mathrm{HI},g}$ and $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{\mathrm{HI},g}$ at the three redshifts, which is $3\sim4$ times smaller than the current result. These findings indicate that the full MeerKAT-CSST joint observation with thousands of square degrees overlapping survey area can be a powerful probe of large-scale structure, and has the ability to provide information of cosmic evolution of HI and galaxies in a wide redshift range.</description>

      <title>Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an accurate and computationally efficient emulator to model the gravitational lensing magnification probability distribution function (PDF), enabling robust cosmological inference of point sources such as supernovae and gravitational-wave observations. We construct a pipeline utilizing cosmological $N$-body simulations, creating past light cones to compute convergence and shear maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model to interpolate magnification PDFs across a broad cosmological parameter space ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, $h$) and redshift range ($0.2 \le z \le 6$). We identify the optimal number of PCA components to balance accuracy and stability. Our emulator, publicly released as ace_lensing, accurately reproduces lensing PDFs with a median Kullback-Leibler divergence of $0.007$. Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} &lt; 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} &gt; 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise characterization on the detection of mHz stochastic gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission. However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by considering the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density within the framework of teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the inherent difficulties in the old models. Furthermore, the Nieh-Yan coupling causes parity violation in gravitational waves, and this can be considered as a clear prediction of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Faint Progenitor System for the Faint Supernova 2024vjm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are well known for their role as standardizable cosmological candles. Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.</description>
