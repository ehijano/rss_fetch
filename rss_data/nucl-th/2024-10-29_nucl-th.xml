      <title>Influences of ${Z=100}$ and ${N=152}$ deformed shells on ${ K^{\pi}=8^{-} }$ isomers and rotational bands in ${N = 150}$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $K^{\pi}=8^{-}$ isomeric states and rotational bands in the even-even $N = 150$ isotones with $94 \leqslant Z \leqslant 104$ are investigated by the cranked shell model (CSM) with pairing correlations treated by the particle-number-conserving (PNC) method. The experimental bandhead energies and kinematic moments of inertia (MOIs) are reproduced quite well by the PNC-CSM calculation. The two-neutron state with configuration $\nu 9/2^{-}[734] \otimes \nu 7/2^{+}[624]$ is the lowest $8^{-}$ state for these isomers. This is a demonstration of the deformed neutron shell at $N=152$. Low-lying two proton $\pi^{2}8^{-}$($\pi 9/2^{+}[624] \otimes \pi 7/2^{-}[514]$) configuration state is predicted only for $^{252}$No and $^{254}$Rf due to the deformed proton shell at $Z=100$. A distinct upbending is observed for the $\nu^{2}8^{-}$ bands in the lighter isotones while it is absent for bands in the heavier ones. The upbending of the $\nu^{2}8^{-}$ band at frequency $\hbar\omega\approx 0.20$ MeV in $^{244}$Pu attributes to the sudden proton alignment of the interference term $j_x(\pi5/2^{+}[642]\otimes\pi7/2^{+}[633])$. The irregularity of MOI observed in the $K^{\pi}=8^{-}$ band of $^{252}$No can be explained by the mixing of the $\nu^{2}8^{-}$($\nu 9/2^{-}[734] \otimes \nu 7/2^{+}[624]$) and $\pi^{2}8^{-}$($\pi 9/2^{+}[624] \otimes \pi 7/2^{-}[514]$) configurations. The $20\%-30\%$ increase of the bandhead $J^{(1)}$ for the $8^{-}$ bands comparing to the ground-state band is attributed to the $\sim 5\%$ pairing gap reduction of the two-neutron $\nu 7/2^{+}[624] \otimes \nu 9/2^{-}[734]$ configuration state comparing to the ground-state band.</description>

      <title>Medium recoil mode of $\Delta$ production in single isobaric charge-exchange reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic mechanisms underlying single charge-exchange reactions have been investigated using a theoretical framework that combines the Isospin-dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) model with the statistical decay model GEMINI++. Two distinct channels contribute to the single isobaric charge-exchange reaction: quasi-elastic channel, where neutron-proton scattering drives the charge-exchange, and inelastic channel, where the $\Delta$ particle is produced during the process. In a referenced study [Phys.RevC 106.014618(2022)], experimental data have revealed that the inelastic channel accounts for approximately 50 percent of the single isobaric charge-exchange reaction. However, our current model fails in reproducing the significant contribution of inelastic channel unless the novel medium recoil mode associated with $\Delta$ production is considered in the calculations. Notably, this in-medium effect arising from inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions is not yet incorporated into mainstream microscopic transport models. The dynamical properties of protons and pions emitting in the single isobaric charge-exchange reactions are predicted. This exploration of in-medium effects adds a valuable dimension to our understanding of the intricate dynamics involved in single charge-exchange reactions.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the $S$ matrix for solving the Marchenko equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20409v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a new approximation of the $S$-matrix dependence on momentum $q$, formulated as a sum of a rational function and a truncated Sinc series. This approach enables pointwise determination of the $S$ matrix with specified resolution, capturing essential features such as resonance behavior with high accuracy. The resulting approximation provides a separable kernel for the Marchenko equation (fixed-$l$ inversion), reducing it to a system of linear equations for the expansion coefficients of the output kernel. Numerical results demonstrate good convergence of this method, applicable to both unitary and non-unitary $S$ matrices. Convergence is further validated through comparisons with an exactly solvable square-well potential model. The method is applied to analyze $S_{31}$ $\pi N$ scattering data.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intruder Levels of Nuclei (96Zr, 98Zr, 98MO) Within the Framework of IBM-2 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current work includes a study of the very rare case called intruder nuclear levels, where there are only seven nuclei in nature. Such cases occur when the first excited state is . The current study included only three nuclei: . The nuclear model used to explore and investigate nuclei in this work is the second interacting boson. The experimental data and theoretical values obtained were in good agreement, indicating this model's success in calculating such anomalies. The main reason for the presence of these levels in other than their natural locations expected according to the IBM model is that they have a double subshell closure. The values of the electric quadrupole transitions, magnetic dipole transitions and zero transitions estimated were in acceptable agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>The elliptic flow difference between baryons and anti-baryons in heavy collision with SMASH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant difference in the elliptic flow $v_2$ for particles and their corresponding antiparticles, which is more pronounced for baryons and anti-baryons, was observed in the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan I (BES-I) at RHIC. By employing the SMASH model, we study the $v_2$ difference between protons and anti-protons, as well as between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$, in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV as a function of evolution time. It finds that as the evolution time increases, the $v_2$ difference between protons and anti-protons becomes more pronounced compared to that between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$. This phenomenon can be explained by the different constituent quarks of protons and $\Lambda$. Since some of the $u$ quarks and $d$ quarks come from the colliding nuclei and are transported to mid-rapidity, they undergo more interactions than produced quarks, resulting in the proton $\Delta v_2$ being larger than the $\Lambda$ $\Delta v_2$. We compare the SMASH calculations with STAR BES-I data and argue that higher precision data from BES-II will provide constraints on theoretical frameworks to interpret the $v_2$ differences of particles and anti-particles.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in the hot QCD medium and the propagation of Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the current understanding of collective excitations and the dynamics of heavy quark propagation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We focus on three core aspects: the theoretical modelling of the QGP, including momentum anisotropy, medium-induced collisions, finite chemical potential, and non-ideal interactions; the collective behaviours within the plasma; and the interaction dynamics of heavy quarks as they traverse the medium. Along with the polarization energy loss mechanisms, we also review the possibility of energy gain due to thermal field fluctuations. Lastly, we discuss how these theoretical insights can be tested through experiments and outline possible directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dependence of $\alpha$-decay spectroscopic factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilities to form an $\alpha$-particle on the surface of heavy nuclei (spectroscopic factors) in the states of different angular momenta are calculated within the dinuclear system (DNS) approach. It is shown that this dependence is determined not only by the energies of the excited states of the daughter nucleus, as is suggested by the Boltzmann distribution, but also by its quadrupole and octupole deformation parameters. The calculations were performed for actinide nuclei $^{222-228}$Ra, $^{222-232}$Th, $^{226-236}$U, and $^{234-242}$Pu. The results obtained will be useful in the future studies on the fine structure of alpha-decay.</description>

      <title>A Universal Bound on QCD Axions from Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Resonant shattering flares as asteroseismic tests of chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) has proved to be a powerful microscopic framework for predicting the properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter with quantified theoretical uncertainties up to about twice the nuclear saturation density. Tests of $\chi$EFT predictions are typically performed at low densities using nuclear experiments, with neutron star (NS) constraints only being considered at high densities. In this work, we discuss how asteroseismic quasi-normal modes within NSs could be used to constrain specific matter properties at particular densities, not just the integrated quantities to which bulk NS observables are sensitive. We focus on the crust-core interface mode, showing that measuring this mode's frequency would provide a meaningful test of $\chi$EFT at densities around half the saturation density. Conversely, we use nuclear matter properties predicted by $\chi$EFT to estimate that this mode's frequency is around 185 $\pm$ 50 Hz. Asteroseismic observables such as resonant phase shifts in gravitational-wave signals and multimessenger resonant shattering flare timings, therefore, have the potential to provide useful tests of $\chi$EFT.</description>

      <title>Re analysis of Temperature Dependent Neutron Capture Rates and Stellar \b{eta} decay Rates of 95 98Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron capture rates and temperature dependent stellar beta decay rates of Mo isotopes are investigated within the framework of the statistical code (Talys v1.96) and proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pnQRPA) models. The Maxwellian average cross section (MACS) and neutron capture rates for 95 98Mo(n,{\gamma}) 96 99Mo radiative capture processes are analyzed within the framework of statistical code Talys v1.96 based on the phenomenological nuclear level density (NLD) parameters and gamma strength functions (GSFs). The current model based computed data for MACS provide a good comparison with the existing measured data. The temperature dependent stellar \b{eta} decay rates of 95 98Mo are investigated at different densities within the framework of the pn-QRPA model. For the considered temperature range, the neutron capture rates were found to be higher, by orders of magnitude, than the stellar \b{eta} rates.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $KN$ elastic and charge exchange reactions in search of the pentaquark $\Theta^+$ baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for the pentaquark $\Theta^+$ baryon, the world data on $K^+n\to K^+n$ and $K^+n\to K^0\,p$ reactions on the deuteron target and $K^0\,p\to K^+n$ and $K^0_L\,p\to K^0_S\,p$ reactions on the hydrogen target are revisited to study the isoscalar component of the scattering amplitudes. The determination of the $s$- and $p$-wave phase shifts for the two former channels on the deuteron target is presented in the low momentum region with the uncertainty due to the deuteron form factors at forward angles discussed. For the reactions on hydrogen targets, a similarity expected from time reversal between the charge exchange processes $K^+n\to K^0\,p$ and $K^0\,p\to K^+n$ is exploited, while we present the analysis of the $K_L^0\,p\to K_S^0\,p$ scattering based on the $s$-wave phase shift for low momenta combined with the $t$-channel $\rho^0(775)+\omega(782)+\phi(1020)$ vector meson exchange at high momenta. With the mass 1535 MeV and decay width 5 MeV the possibility of the $\Theta^+$ in the Breit-Wigner (BW) form is tested in the differential cross section measured by C. J. S. Damerell {\it et\ al.} at ${\rm P_{Lab}}=434$ MeV/$c$ and polarization. Our analysis suggests measuring the polarization observable rather than the differential cross section, which has sufficient sensitivity to distinguish the $\Theta^+$ baryon among all spin and parity states $J^P = 1/2^\pm$ and $3/2^\pm$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of phase transitions on quark spin fluctuation and correlation. We propose a novel observable for quark-antiquark correlation that relates to vector meson spin alignment and $\Lambda-\bar\Lambda$ correlation. Using the Nambu-Jona-Lanisio model, we qualitatively study the properties of quark-antiquark spin correlation. Our findings reveal a peak structure near the critical end point (CED) of chiral phase transition, which may serve as an experimental signature of the CEP and help explain the non-monotonic behavior of $\phi$ meson alignment at low collision energies.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment (LCOT). Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Antineutrino Opacity in Neutron Stars in the Models Constrained by Recent Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate neutral current (NC) antineutrino scattering with the constituents of neutron star (NS) matter at zero temperature. The modeling of standard matter in NS is constructed within the framework of both extended relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) and nonrelativistic Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU energy density functional (KIDS-EDF) models. In the E-RMF model, we use a new parameter, G3(M), which was constrained by the recent PREX II experiment measurement of neutron distribution in $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, while the KIDS-EDF models are constrained by terrestrial experiments, gravitational-wave signals, and astrophysical observations. Using both realistic and well-constrained matter models, we then calculate the antineutrino differential cross-section (ADCS) and antineutrino mean free path (AMFP) for the interaction between antineutrinos and neutron star (NS) matter constituents using linear response theory. It is found that the AMFP for the KIDS0 and KIDSA models are smaller compared to the SLy4 model and the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. The AMFP result of the Skyrme model with the SLy4 parameter set is found to have a prediction almost similar to that of the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. Contributions of each nucleon to the total AMFP are also presented for the G3(M) model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian mixture model approach to quantifying the empirical nuclear saturation point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) in the limit of infinite symmetric nuclear matter exhibits an equilibrium density, $n_0 \approx 0.16 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, at which the pressure vanishes and the energy per particle attains its minimum, $E_0 \approx -16 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Although not directly measurable, the saturation point $(n_0,E_0)$ can be extrapolated by density functional theory (DFT), providing tight constraints for microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective field theory (EFT). However, when considering several DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ from Skyrme and Relativistic Mean Field models together, a discrepancy between these model classes emerges at high confidence levels that each model prediction's uncertainty cannot explain. How can we leverage these DFT constraints to rigorously benchmark saturation properties of chiral interactions? To address this question, we present a Bayesian mixture model that combines multiple DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ using an efficient conjugate prior approach. The inferred posterior for the saturation point's mean and covariance matrix follows a Normal-inverse-Wishart class, resulting in posterior predictives in the form of correlated, bivariate $t$-distributions. The DFT uncertainty reports are then used to mix these posteriors using an ordinary Monte Carlo approach. At the 95\% credibility level, we estimate $n_0 \approx 0.157 \pm 0.010 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $E_0 \approx -15.97 \pm 0.40 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ for the marginal (univariate) $t$-distributions. Combined with chiral EFT calculations of the pure neutron matter EOS, we obtain bivariate normal distributions for the symmetry energy and its slope parameter at $n_0$: $S_v \approx 32.0 \pm 1.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $L\approx 52.6\pm 8.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ (95\%), respectively. Our Bayesian framework is publicly available, so practitioners can readily use and extend our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of the dense-matter equation of state is essential for the phenomenology of neutron stars. In this work, I relate the thermodynamic properties to the average speed of sound in the interior of a star. I study the consequences of the vanishing of the trace anomaly. In particular, I show that if the trace anomaly vanishes in the centers of maximally massive neutron stars, the speed of sound likely exceeds its conformal value and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior. I also find that the additional assumption of positive definiteness of the trace anomaly naturally induces a local peak of the speed of sound at densities realized in the cores of neutron stars. I also reanalyze the stability condition for hybrid neutron stars. Possible implications for the dense matter equation of state and the phenomenology of neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy density functionals (EDFs) have been used extensively with great success to calculate properties of nuclei and to predict the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Besides non-relativistic EDFs, mostly of the Skyrme or Gogny type, relativistic EDFs of different types are in widespread use. In these latter approaches, the effective in-medium interaction is described by an exchange of mesons between nucleons. In most cases, only minimal meson-nucleon couplings are considered. The effects of additional tensor couplings were rarely investigated. In this work, a new relativistic EDF with tensor couplings and density dependent minimal meson-nucleon couplings will be presented. The parameters of the model are determined using a carefully selected set of experimental data with realistic uncertainties that are determined self-consistently. Predictions for various nuclear observables, the nuclear matter equation of state, and properties of neutron stars are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.03040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic $K^+ n\to K^+ n$ and charge exchange $K^+n\to K^0p$ reactions at low momenta are investigated using the partial wave analysis. Isospin relation gives constrains for the partial $s$- and $p$-waves among elastic $K^+p$, $K^+n$ and charge exchange $K^+n\to K^0p$ amplitudes. Two sets of the phase shift for these partial waves in the isoscalar channel are obtained from the fit of experimental data on total and differential cross sections. Polarization observable leads to a good criterion to decide which set is valid. Differential cross section data near $P_{\rm Lab}=434$ MeV/$c$ suggests a possibility of a resonance, e.g., the exotic $\Theta^+(1540)$ baryon around $\sqrt{s}\simeq$ 1.54GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <title>Charmonium production in hot magnetized hyperonic matter -- effects of baryonic Dirac sea and pseudoscalar-vector meson mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the medium modifications of the masses of pseudoscalar open charm ($D$ and $\bar D$) mesons and the charmonium state ($\psi(3770)$) in hot isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium in the presence of an external magnetic field within a chiral effective model. The in-medium partial decay widths of $\psi(3770)$ to $D\bar D$ mesons are computed from the in-medium masses of the initial and final state mesons. These are computed using two light quark pair creation models - (I) the $^3P_0$ model and (II) a field theoretical (FT) model of composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$, arising from scattering of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons, are computed from the relativistic Breit-Wigner spectral function expressed in terms of the in-medium masses and the decay widths of the charmonium state. The effects of the magnetic field are considered due to the Dirac sea (DS) of the baryons, the mixing of the pseudoscalar and vector meson (PV mixing) and the Landau level contributions for the charged hadrons. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$ arising due to scattering of $D^+D^-(D^0\bar{D}^0)$ mesons in the hot magnetized strange hadronic matter are observed to have distinct peak positions, when the magnetic field is large, due to the mass difference of the transverse and longitudinal components of $\psi(3770)$, arising from PV mixing. These can have observable consequences on the dilepton spectra and the production of the charm mesons in ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the produced magnetic field is huge.</description>

      <title>Nuclear medium meson structures from the Schwinger proper-time Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the results of our study on the nuclear medium modifications of the meson electromagnetic form factors in the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the help of the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme to tame the loop divergence and simulate the effect of QCD confinement. In our current approach, the meson structure and nuclear medium are constructed in the same NJL model at the quark level. We examine the free-space and in-medium charge radii of kaon and pion, the spacelike elastic electromagnetic form factors of kaon and pion, and their quark-sector form factors, which reflect their internal structures. By comparing our result to experimental data, we found that the free-space elastic electromagnetic form factors of the mesons are consistent with the data, while the in-medium elastic electromagnetic form factors of the mesons are found to decrease as the nuclear matter density increases, leading to a rise of meson charge radius, which is consistent with the prediction of other theoretical calculations. We also predict the axial nucleon coupling constant $g_A$ in nuclear medium computed via the Goldberger-Treiman relation (GTR), which is crucial for searching the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$).</description>

Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint in explaining the experimental data on neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for those existing experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path as well as their totals, which is given by a sum of the Standard Model and nonstandard interaction.</description>

      <title>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Comprehensive prediction for low energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos play a vital role in generating irreducible backgrounds in liquid-scintillator (LS) detectors via their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei. These interactions may affect a wide range of research areas from the MeV to GeV energy range, such as the reactor and geo neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), dark matter, and nucleon decay searches. In this work, we extend our preceding paper, by conducting a first-time systematic exploration of NC backgrounds as low as the MeV region of reactor and geo neutrinos. We utilize up-to-date neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro, a TALYS-based nuclear deexcitation package and a GEANT4-based detector simulation toolkit for our complete calculation. Our primary focus is to predict the NC background for experimental searches of inverse-beta-decay signals below the 100 MeV visible energy. In order to have deeper understanding of the characteristics of atmospheric neutrino NC interactions in LS, we investigate the model dependence of NC background predictions by using various data-driven models, including the initial neutrino-nucleon interactions, nuclear ground-state structure, final-state interactions, nuclear deexcitation processes, and secondary interactions of final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, and the locations of the two peaks are sensitive to the maximum value of $J_{\rm{sym}}$ reflecting the stiffness of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ above about 3 times the saturation density $\rho_0$ of SNM, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around $(2-3)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>BCS-BEC crossover of the strongly interacting $^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the properties of a two-component mass imbalanced Fermi gas, corresponding to the $^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture. We compute the equation of state of the unpolarized system as a function of the scattering length with particular attention paid to the unitary limit, where the effect of the effective range of the interaction is explored. We have also computed the pair distribution function and the momentum distribution over a range of interaction strengths to provide information about the structure of the system. Finally, we have computed the heavy/light quasiparticle spectrum. Our theoretical predictions, based on Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, can be tested by future experiments with ultracold fermionic gases.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ gluon GPD constrained from deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production and gluon PDF through universal-moment parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We phenomenologically constrain the small-$x$ and small-$\xi$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with the deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production (DV$J/\psi$P) in the framework of GPDs through universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We use a hybrid cross-section formula combining collinear factorization to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, with corrections from non-relativistic QCD to account for the power corrections due to the heavy $J/\psi$ mass. We reach reasonable fit to the measured differential cross-sections of DV$J/\psi$P by H1 at Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) as well as forward gluon PDFs from JAM22 global analysis. We find that both NLO and non-relativistic corrections are significant for heavy vector meson productions. Of course, the gluon GPD we obtain still contain considerable freedom in need of inputs from other constraints, particularly in the distribution-amplitude-like region.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Probing the onset of hydrodynamization in peripheral p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An attempt has been made to estimate the minimum size of the de-confined matter of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in small system that could be satisfactorily modeled with low-order hydrodynamics. The elliptic flow coefficient has been studied for the variation of second order transport coefficient called the shear relaxation time, which acts as a regulator of the non-hydrodynamic mode of theory. The small system of p-Pb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV is simulated on the state-of-art framework of JETSCAPE. We modeled the soft sector dynamics using an initial condition, a pre-equilibrium stage, hydrodynamics and a hadron afterburner. We generated results of transverse momentum spectra and rapidity spectra of light particles to match the simulated system with the experimental data. We looked at elliptic flow variation for extreme values of shear relaxation time for peripheral collision centralities. The increase in elliptic flow fluctuations indicate breakdown of fluid behavior at around $dN/dy \approx 8$ for p-Pb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Near-Side Energy-Energy Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy-energy correlator (EEC) of hadrons produced on the same side in $e^+e^-$ annihilation or in leading jets in $pp$ collisions. We observe a remarkable universality of the correlator. Using a non-perturbative transverse momentum dependent (TMD) fragmentation function to model the transition from the ``free-hadron" region to the perturbative collinear region, we are able to describe the near-side shapes and peaks over a wide range of energy for both the $e^+e^-$ annihilation and the $pp$ jet substructure measurements in terms of just two parameters. We present further predictions for the ratio of the projected three-point energy correlator to the EEC. The excellent agreement between our calculations and the experimental data may provide new insights into the role of non-perturbative physics for EECs, and suggests the possibility of exploring non-perturbative TMDs using theoretical tools developed for the energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Mixing mechanism for the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>
