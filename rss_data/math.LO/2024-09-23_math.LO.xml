      <title>Amalgamation Property in the subvarieties of Gautama and Almost Gautama algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gautama algebras were introduced recently, as a common generalization of regular double Stone algebras and regular Kleene Stone algebras. Even more recently, Gautama algebras were further generalized to Almost Gautama algebras (AG for short). The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the Amalgamation Property (AP, for short) in the subvarieties of the variety AG. In fact, we show that, of the eight nontrivial subvarieties of AG, only four varieties, namely those of Boolean algebras, of regular double Stone algebras, of regular Kleene Stone algebras and of De Morgan Boolean algebras have the AP and the remaining four do not have the AP. We give several applications of this result; in particular, we examine the following properties for the subvarieties of AG: transferability property (TP), having enough injectives (EI), Embedding Property, Bounded Obstruction Property and having a model companion.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Borel Isomorphism Among Some Weakly Minimal Trivial Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize having Borel isomorphism relation among some weakly minimal trivial theories, namely the examples of families of finite equivalence relations from recent joint work with Laskowski, and tame expansions of crosscutting-equivalence relations. We also prove a dichotomy in Borel complexity for the latter.</description>

      <title>Amalgamation and Keisler's Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malliaris and Shelah famously proved that Keisler's order $\trianglelefteq$ has infinitely many classes. In more detail, for each $2 \leq k &lt; n &lt; \omega$, let $T_{n, k}$ be the theory of the random $k$-ary $n$-clique free hypergraph. Malliaris and Shelah show that whenever $k+1 &lt; k'$, then $T_{k+1, k} \not \trianglelefteq T_{k'+1, k'}$. However, their arguments do not separate $T_{k+1, k}$ from $T_{k+2, k+1}$, and the model-theoretic properties detected by their ultrafilters are difficult to evaluate in practice.
  We uniformize the relevant ultrafilter constructions and obtain sharper model-theoretic bounds. As a sample application, we prove the following: suppose $3 \leq k &lt; \aleph_0$, and $T$ is a countable low theory. Suppose that every independent system $(M_s: s \subsetneq k)$ of countable models of $T$ can be independently amalgamated. Then $T_{k, k-1} \not \trianglelefteq T$. In particular, for all $k &lt; k'$, $T_{k+1, k} \not \trianglelefteq T_{k'+1, k'}$.</description>

      <title>Pre-measure spaces and pre-integration spaces in predicative Bishop-Cheng measure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bishop's measure theory (BMT) is an abstraction of the measure theory of a locally compact metric space $X$, and the use of an informal notion of a set-indexed family of complemented subsets is crucial to its predicative character. The more general Bishop-Cheng measure theory (BCMT) is a constructive version of the classical Daniell approach to measure and integration, and highly impredicative, as many of its fundamental notions, such as the integration space of $p$-integrable functions $L^p$, rely on quantification over proper classes (from the constructive point of view). In this paper we introduce the notions of a pre-measure and pre-integration space, a predicative variation of the Bishop-Cheng notion of a measure space and of an integration space, respectively. Working within Bishop Set Theory (BST), and using the theory of set-indexed families of complemented subsets and set-indexed families of real-valued partial functions within BST, we apply the implicit, predicative spirit of BMT to BCMT. As a first example, we present the pre-measure space of complemented detachable subsets of a set $X$ with the Dirac-measure, concentrated at a single point. Furthermore, we translate in our predicative framework the non-trivial, Bishop-Cheng construction of an integration space from a given measure space, showing that a pre-measure space induces the pre-integration space of simple functions associated to it. Finally, a predicative construction of the canonically integrable functions $L^1$, as the completion of an integration space, is included.</description>

      <title>Filtered Boolean powers of finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebra (e.g. a group, loop, ring). We investigate the Boolean power $\mathbf{D}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$ filtered at some idempotents $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$. When $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are all idempotents of $\mathbf{A}$ we establish two concrete representations of $\mathbf{D}$: as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite direct powers of $\mathbf{A}$, and as congruence classes of the countable free algebra in the variety generated by $\mathbf{A}$. Further, for arbitrary $e_1,\dots,e_n$, we show that $\mathbf{D}$ is $\omega$-categorical and that its automorphism group has the small index property, strong uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. As necessary background we establish some general properties of congruences and automorphisms of filtered Boolean powers of $\mathbf{A}$ by any Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$, including a semidirect decomposition for their automorphism groups.</description>
