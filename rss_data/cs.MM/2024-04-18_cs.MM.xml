      <title>Dynamic Self-adaptive Multiscale Distillation from Pre-trained Multimodal Large Model for Efficient Cross-modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pre-trained multimodal large models have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance in various multimodal applications. Nonetheless, the extensive computational resources and vast datasets required for their training present significant hurdles for deployment in environments with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dynamic self-adaptive multiscale distillation from pre-trained multimodal large model for efficient cross-modal representation learning for the first time. Unlike existing distillation methods, our strategy employs a multiscale perspective, enabling the extraction structural knowledge across from the pre-trained multimodal large model. Ensuring that the student model inherits a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the teacher knowledge. To optimize each distillation loss in a balanced and efficient manner, we propose a dynamic self-adaptive distillation loss balancer, a novel component eliminating the need for manual loss weight adjustments and dynamically balances each loss item during the distillation process. Our methodology streamlines pre-trained multimodal large models using only their output features and original image-level information, requiring minimal computational resources. This efficient approach is suited for various applications and allows the deployment of advanced multimodal technologies even in resource-limited settings. Extensive experiments has demonstrated that our method maintains high performance while significantly reducing model complexity and training costs. Moreover, our distilled student model utilizes only image-level information to achieve state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks, surpassing previous methods that relied on region-level information.</description>

      <title>FairSSD: Understanding Bias in Synthetic Speech Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods that can generate synthetic speech which is perceptually indistinguishable from speech recorded by a human speaker, are easily available. Several incidents report misuse of synthetic speech generated from these methods to commit fraud. To counter such misuse, many methods have been proposed to detect synthetic speech. Some of these detectors are more interpretable, can generalize to detect synthetic speech in the wild and are robust to noise. However, limited work has been done on understanding bias in these detectors. In this work, we examine bias in existing synthetic speech detectors to determine if they will unfairly target a particular gender, age and accent group. We also inspect whether these detectors will have a higher misclassification rate for bona fide speech from speech-impaired speakers w.r.t fluent speakers. Extensive experiments on 6 existing synthetic speech detectors using more than 0.9 million speech signals demonstrate that most detectors are gender, age and accent biased, and future work is needed to ensure fairness. To support future research, we release our evaluation dataset, models used in our study and source code at https://gitlab.com/viper-purdue/fairssd.</description>

      <title>Music Enhancement with Deep Filters: A Technical Report for The ICASSP 2024 Cadenza Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this challenge, we disentangle the deep filters from the original DeepfilterNet and incorporate them into our Spec-UNet-based network to further improve a hybrid Demucs (hdemucs) based remixing pipeline. The motivation behind the use of the deep filter component lies at its potential in better handling temporal fine structures. We demonstrate an incremental improvement in both the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) and the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) metrics when comparing the performance of hdemucs against different versions of our model.</description>

      <title>DRepMRec: A Dual Representation Learning Framework for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation focuses mainly on how to effectively integrate behavior and multimodal information in the recommendation task. Previous works suffer from two major issues. Firstly, the training process tightly couples the behavior module and multimodal module by jointly optimizing them using the sharing model parameters, which leads to suboptimal performance since behavior signals and modality signals often provide opposite guidance for the parameters updates. Secondly, previous approaches fail to take into account the significant distribution differences between behavior and modality when they attempt to fuse behavior and modality information. This resulted in a misalignment between the representations of behavior and modality. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Dual Representation learning framework for Multimodal Recommendation called DRepMRec, which introduce separate dual lines for coupling problem and Behavior-Modal Alignment (BMA) for misalignment problem. Specifically, DRepMRec leverages two independent lines of representation learning to calculate behavior and modal representations. After obtaining separate behavior and modal representations, we design a Behavior-Modal Alignment Module (BMA) to align and fuse the dual representations to solve the misalignment problem. Furthermore, we integrate the BMA into other recommendation models, resulting in consistent performance improvements. To ensure dual representations maintain their semantic independence during alignment, we introduce Similarity-Supervised Signal (SSS) for representation learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Guided Generation of Structured Chest X-Ray Report Using a Pre-trained LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical report generation automates radiology descriptions from images, easing the burden on physicians and minimizing errors. However, current methods lack structured outputs and physician interactivity for clear, clinically relevant reports. Our method introduces a prompt-guided approach to generate structured chest X-ray reports using a pre-trained large language model (LLM). First, we identify anatomical regions in chest X-rays to generate focused sentences that center on key visual elements, thereby establishing a structured report foundation with anatomy-based sentences. We also convert the detected anatomy into textual prompts conveying anatomical comprehension to the LLM. Additionally, the clinical context prompts guide the LLM to emphasize interactivity and clinical requirements. By integrating anatomy-focused sentences and anatomy/clinical prompts, the pre-trained LLM can generate structured chest X-ray reports tailored to prompted anatomical regions and clinical contexts. We evaluate using language generation and clinical effectiveness metrics, demonstrating strong performance.</description>

      <title>Text-controlled Motion Mamba: Text-Instructed Temporal Grounding of Human Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion understanding is a fundamental task with diverse practical applications, facilitated by the availability of large-scale motion capture datasets. Recent studies focus on text-motion tasks, such as text-based motion generation, editing and question answering. In this study, we introduce the novel task of text-based human motion grounding (THMG), aimed at precisely localizing temporal segments corresponding to given textual descriptions within untrimmed motion sequences. Capturing global temporal information is crucial for the THMG task. However, transformer-based models that rely on global temporal self-attention face challenges when handling long untrimmed sequences due to the quadratic computational cost. We address these challenges by proposing Text-controlled Motion Mamba (TM-Mamba), a unified model that integrates temporal global context, language query control, and spatial graph topology with only linear memory cost. The core of the model is a text-controlled selection mechanism which dynamically incorporates global temporal information based on text query. The model is further enhanced to be topology-aware through the integration of relational embeddings. For evaluation, we introduce BABEL-Grounding, the first text-motion dataset that provides detailed textual descriptions of human actions along with their corresponding temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of TM-Mamba on BABEL-Grounding.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning: a Promising Way to Open-set Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is an active research topic in artificial intelligence. Its main goal is to integrate multi-modalities to identify human emotional states. Current works generally assume accurate emotion labels for benchmark datasets and focus on developing more effective architectures. However, emotions have inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. To obtain more reliable labels, existing datasets usually restrict the label space to some basic categories, then hire multiple annotators and use majority voting to select the most likely label. However, this process may cause some correct but non-candidate or non-majority labels to be ignored. To improve reliability without ignoring subtle emotions, we propose a new task called ``\textbf{Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER)}''. In contrast to traditional tasks that focus on predicting emotions, EMER takes a step further by providing explanations for these predictions. Through this task, we can extract more reliable labels since each label has a certain basis. Meanwhile, we use LLMs to disambiguate unimodal descriptions and generate more complete multimodal EMER descriptions. From them, we can extract subtle labels, providing a promising approach for open-set emotion recognition. This paper presents our initial efforts, where we introduce a new dataset, establish baselines, and define evaluation metrics. In addition, EMER can also be used as a benchmark dataset to evaluate the audio-video-text understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will make the code and data available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.</description>
