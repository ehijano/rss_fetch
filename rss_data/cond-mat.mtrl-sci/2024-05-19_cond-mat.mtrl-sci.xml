      <title>Using Partial Structure R1 to Determine Small-Molecule Crystal Structures at the Lowest Resolution Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the lowest data resolution at which the partial structure R1 (pR1) method can determine a small-molecule crystal structure. Three specific structures have been studied. For a structure having 4 S atoms out of total 32 atoms in its unit cell, the lowest structure-solvable resolution is 1.5 A, and at this resolution all the atoms are individually searchable by the sR1 method (a specialized form of the pR1 method in which the partial structure contains a single atom). For the other two samples, which have 46 and 156 C atoms in their unit cells, respectively, the lowest structure-solvable resolutions are 1.5 A and 1.2 A, respectively, and both require a combination of the pR1 and the sR1 methods to determine their structures at these resolution limits. In all three cases, the usual choice of method for solving a small-molecule crystal structure, namely, the SHELXT program, is not applicable. Therefore, the pR1 method complements the SHELXT for determination of a small-molecule crystal structure at these lowest resolution limits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and Exploration of Deep Learning-based Atomistic Models for Screening Molten Salt Properties and Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to extreme chemical, thermal, and radiation environments, existing molten salt property databases lack the necessary experimental thermal properties of reactor-relevant salt compositions. Meanwhile, simulating these properties directly is typically either computationally expensive or inaccurate. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based atomistic simulations have emerged as a method for achieving both efficiency and accuracy. However, there remain significant challenges in assessing model reliability in DL models when simulating properties and screening new systems. In this work, structurally complex LiF-NaF-ZrF$_4$ salt is studied. We show that neural network (NN) uncertainty can be quantified using ensemble learning to provide a 95% confidence interval (CI) for NN-based predictions. We show that DL models can successfully extrapolate to new compositions, temperatures, and timescales, but fail for significant changes in density, which is captured by ensemble-based uncertainty predictions. This enables improved confidence in utilizing simulated data for realistic reactor conditions, and guidelines for training deployable DL models.</description>

      <title>Giant Linear Dichroism Controlled by Magnetic Field in FePS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic-field control of fundamental optical properties is a crucial challenge in the engineering of multifunctional microdevices. Van der Waals (vdW) magnets retaining a magnetic order even in atomically thin layers, offer a promising platform for hosting exotic magneto-optical functionalities owing to their strong spin-charge coupling. Here, we demonstrate that a giant optical anisotropy can be controlled by magnetic fields in the vdW magnet FePS$_3$. The giant linear dichroism ($\sim$11%), observed below $T_{\text{N}}\!\sim\!120$ K, is nearly fully suppressed in a wide energy range from 1.6 to 2.0 eV, following the collapse of the zigzag magnetic order above 40 T. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained as a result of symmetry changes due to the spin order, enabling minority electrons of Fe$^{2+}$ to hop in a honeycomb lattice. The modification of spin-order symmetry by external fields provides a novel route for controllable anisotropic optical micro-devices.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of entropy measure using regression models for diamond structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, referred to as a topological index, is used to represent the molecular structure of a compound by analyzing its graph-theoretical characteristics. Topological indices are predictive methods for the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds in the context of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis. Graph entropies have evolved into information-theoretic tools for exploring the structural information of molecular graphs. In this paper, we compute the Nirmala index, as well as the first and second inverse Nirmala index, for the diamond structure using its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures based on Nirmala indices are derived for the diamond structure. The comparison of the Nirmala indices and corresponding entropy measures is presented through numerical computation and 2D line plots. A regression model is built to investigate the relationship between the Nirmala indices and corresponding entropy measures.</description>

      <title>Residual Stress Development in Lattice Mismatched Epitaxial Thin Films via Atomic and Molecular Layer Depositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic and molecular layer deposition (ALD/MLD) coatings are promising solutions for preventing dendrite formation in aqueous and non-aqueous Li/Na/Zn metal batteries. Notably, alumina and alucone coatings have emerged as highly effective against dendrite formation in Zn anodes. Despite their demonstrated efficacy, a comprehensive understanding of their chemo-mechanical impact on anodes remains elusive. In this study, we take a bottom-up framework to these coatings on Zn foils, employing an approach that integrates \textit{ab initio} simulations with continuum theories to elucidate lattice misfit and chemical bonding. We use this insight to develop a macroscopic model to predict the epitaxial residual stresses generated during thin-film deposition. Our findings reveal a robust chemical bonding between the hydroxylated Zn surface and the thin film. This, in turn, generates large misfit strains that result in significant interfacial stresses during deposition. These results are then compared to experiments by measuring the curvature of the coated thin films, finding good agreement between experiments and theory. This novel understanding sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the development of chemo-mechanical stresses in thin films, which impact dendrite suppression in anodes, offering valuable insights for the design of new coatings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present a review of the phenomenology of the spontaneous exchange bias effect, a phenomenon in which some materials exhibit unidirectional magnetic anisotropy even without the assistance of an external magnetic field applied during its cooling process. We review and discuss the most critical advances in this field of research that flourished more than a decade ago, pointing out its main features as well as its similarities and dissimilarities with the conventional exchange bias effect that has been vastly investigated since the 1950 decade. Finally, we briefly overview the obstacles to advancement in the field and discuss what we believe could be promising roads to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Dynamic In-context Learning with Conversational Models for Data Extraction and Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the extraction of data from unstructured scholarly papers. However, ensuring data trustworthiness remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce PropertyExtractor, an open-source tool that leverages advanced conversational LLMs like Google Gemini-Pro and OpenAI GPT-4, blends zero-shot with few-shot in-context learning, and employs engineered prompts for the dynamic refinement of structured information hierarchies, enabling autonomous, efficient, scalable, and accurate identification, extraction, and verification of material property data. Our tests on material data demonstrate precision and recall exceeding 93% with an error rate of approximately 10%, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the toolkit. We apply PropertyExtractor to generate a database of 2D material thicknesses, a critical parameter for device integration. The rapid evolution of the field has outpaced both experimental measurements and computational methods, creating a significant data gap. Our work addresses this gap and showcases the potential of PropertyExtractor as a reliable and efficient tool for the autonomous generation of diverse material property databases, advancing the field.</description>

      <title>Epitaxially Grown Single-Crystalline SrTiO3 Membranes Using a Solution-Processed, Amorphous SrCa2Al2O6 Sacrificial Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-soluble sacrificial layers based on epitaxially-grown, single crystalline (Ca, Sr, Ba)3Al2O6 layer are widely used for creating free-standing perovskite oxide membranes. However, obtaining these sacrificial layers with intricate stoichiometry remains a challenge, especially for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In this study, we demonstrate the hybrid MBE growth of epitaxial, single crystalline SrTiO3 films using a solution processed, amorphous SrCa2Al2O6 sacrificial layer onto SrTiO3 (001) substrates. Prior to the growth, the oxygen plasma exposure was used to first create the crystalline SrCa2Al2O6 layer with well-defined surface crystallinity. Utilizing reflection high energy electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy, we observe an atomic layer-by-layer growth of epitaxial, single crystalline SrTiO3 film on the SrCa2Al2O6 layer with atomically smooth surfaces. The SrCa2Al2O6 layer was subsequently dissolved in de-ionized water to create free-standing SrTiO3 membranes that were transferred onto a metal-coated Si wafer. Membranes created with Sr-deficiency revealed ferroelectric-like behavior measured using piezo force microscopy whereas stoichiometric films remained paraelectric-like. These findings underscore the viability of using ex-situ deposited amorphous SrCa2Al2O6 for epitaxial, single crystalline growth, as well as the importance of point defects in determining the ferroic properties in membranes.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary solute segregation across the 5D space of crystallographic character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation in materials with grain boundaries (GBs) has emerged as a popular method to thermodynamically stabilize nanocrystalline structures. However, the impact of varied GB crystallographic character on solute segregation has never been thoroughly examined. This work examines Co solute segregation in a dataset of 7272 Al bicrystal GBs that span the 5D space of GB crystallographic character. Considerable attention is paid to verification of the calculations in the diverse and large set of GBs. In addition, the results of this work are favorably validated against similar bicrystal and polycrystal simulations. As with other work, we show that Co atoms exhibit strong segregation to sites in Al GBs and that segregation correlates strongly with GB energy and GB excess volume. Segregation varies smoothly in the 5D crystallographic space but has a complex landscape without an obvious functional form.</description>

      <title>Freestanding perovskite and infinite-layer nickelate membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped NdNiO$_2$ infinite-layer thin films, extensive research has been conducted particularly to compare these materials with cuprates. Superconductivity has also been observed in nickelate thin films with other rare-earth elements like Pr and La, but not in their bulk forms, suggesting a critical role for substrate-induced strain/interface or dimensionality effects. In this study, we use water-soluble (Ca,Sr)$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ sacrificial layers to fabricate freestanding perovskite nickelate membranes and explore topotactic reduction without the SrTiO$_3$ substrate as a template. NdNiO$_3$-based heterostructure membranes transferred from a LaAlO$_3$ substrate exhibit better metallic behavior and higher hysteresis than those transferred from SrTiO$_3$, owing to the different strain states that the NdNiO$_3$ layer experience when grown on these two substrates. Despite the expected X-ray diffraction shifts, membranes reduced with CaH$_2$ display insulating characteristics, similar to bulk infinite-layer nickelates. Our findings strongly indicate that a template is necessary to stabilize a coherent and robust infinite-layer phase with optimal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate and thickness on spin-wave propagation properties in ferrimagnetic thulium iron garnet thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnets have distinctive spin-wave (SW) properties such as low magnetic damping and long SW coherence length making them ideal candidates for magnonics. Among them, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) is a ferrimagnetic insulator with unique magnetic properties including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and topological hall effect at room temperature when grown down to a few nanometers, extending its application to magnon spintronics. Here, the SW propagation properties of TmIG films (thickness of 7 - 34 nm) grown on GGG and sGGG substrates are studied at room temperature. Magnetic measurements show in-plane magnetic anisotropy for TmIG films grown on GGG and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy for films grown on sGGG substrates with PMA. SW electrical transmission spectroscopy measurements on TmIG /GGG films unveil magnetostatic surface spin waves (MSSWs) propagating up to 80 um with a SW group velocity of 3 - 8 km/s. Intriguingly, these MSSWs exhibit nonreciprocal propagation, opening new applications in SW functional devices. TmIG films grown on sGGG substrates exhibit forward volume spin waves with a reciprocal propagation behavior up to 32 um.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals hetrostructure configuration effect on exciton and thermoelectric characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A GW calculation based on a truncated coulomb interaction with an added small q limit was applied to 2D van der Waals hetro-layered structures, and the Kane dispersion model was used to determine the accurate band gap edge. All ab initio calculations were performed with the gpaw package. Our findings show that layering the same or different types of atoms with a vacuum in between has an enormous impact on band alignment, effective mass of holes and electrons, exciton binding energy, thermoelectric characteristics, density of hot electrons, and electronic band gaps.Thus, layered interactions of the same kind constrain the configuration to have a direct band gap, whereas different kinds allow for an indirect gap, resulting in an indirect exciton with a greater binding energy due to the band confinement effect. Furthermore, the hetrostructure of the highest configuration facilitates the relaxation of hot electrons by forming unoccupied states. This leads to a high density of hot electrons dispersing over unoccupied states, which lessens their sensitivity to temperature; in other words, thermal drop prolongs electron-hole pairing. $\mathrm{MoSe_{2}-MoS_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{MoSeSe-MoSSe}$ have an improved seebeck coefficient among the various possible configurations because of their low heat conductivity, ability to produce a higher density of states and empty states, improved optical gap, and multiple excitation peaks that resemble the experimental photoluminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>Absence of magnetic order in RuO$_2$: insights from $\mu$SR spectroscopy and neutron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of magnetic materials besides ferro- and antiferromagnets, where the interplay of lattice and spin symmetries produces a magnetic order that is staggered both in coordinate as well as momentum space. The metallic rutile oxide RuO$_2$, long believed to be a textbook Pauli paramagnet, recently emerged as a workhorse altermagnet when resonant X-ray and neutron scattering studies reported nonzero magnetic moments and long-range collinear order. While experiments on thin films seem consistent with altermagnetic behavior, the origin and size of magnetic moments in RuO$_2$ still remain controversial. Here we show that RuO$_2$ is nonmagnetic, regardless if as bulk or thin film. Employing muon spin spectroscopy as a highly sensitive probe of local magnetic moments complemented by density functional theory, we find at most $1.4 \times 10^{-4} $ $\mu_B$/Ru in bulk RuO$_2$ and at most $7.5 \times 10^{-4}$ $\mu_B$/Ru in epitaxial films. In their essence, these moments reflect the detection limit of our spectrometers and are orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported neutron results, i.e., the moments previously assumed to rationalize altermagnetic behavior. Our own neutron diffraction measurements on RuO$_2$ single crystals identify multiple scattering as a likely source for this discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Binding energy referencing in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: expanded data set confirms that adventitious carbon aligns to the vacuum level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correct referencing of the binding energy (BE) scale is essential for the accuracy of chemical analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The C 1s C C/C-H peak from adventitious carbon (AdC), most commonly used for that purpose, was previously shown to shift by several eVs following changes in the sample work function, thus indicating that AdC aligns to the sample vacuum level (VL). Here, results from a much larger sample set are presented including 360 specimens of thin-film samples comprising metals, nitrides, carbides, borides, oxides, carbonitrides, and oxynitrides. Irrespective of the material system the C 1s peak of AdC is found to follow changes in the sample work function fully confirming previous results. Several observations exclude differential charging as plausible explanation. All experimental evidence points instead to the VL alignment at the AdC/sample interface as the source of shifts. Should the C 1s peak of AdC be used for spectra referencing the measurement of sample work function is necessary, irrespective of whether samples are measured grounded or insulated from the spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Bulk nanoscale structural correlations in a model cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. We combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling, which enables us to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements predominant perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. The experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials, especially as advances in scattering techniques present researchers with more comprehensive data to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal breathing solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They manifest themselves in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation upon reachin a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in FM/AFM heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have garnered attention for their potential roles in spintronic applications, such as information carriers in computation, data storage, and nano-oscillators due to their small size, topological stability, and the requirement of small electric currents to manipulate them. Two key challenges in harnessing skyrmions are the stabilization requirement through a strong out-of-plane field, and the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE). Here, we present a systematic model study of skyrmions in FM/AFM multi-layer structures by employing both atomistic Monte Carlo and atomistic spin dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that skyrmions stabilized by exchange bias have superior stability than field-stabilized skyrmions due to the formation of a magnetic imprint within the AFM layer. Additionally, stacking two skyrmion hosting FM layers between two antiferromagnetic (AFM) layers suppresses the SkHE and enables the transport of AFM-coupled skyrmions with high velocity in the order of a few Km/s. This proposed multi-layer configuration could serve as a pathway to overcome existing limitations in the development of skyrmion-based devices, and the insights obtained through this study contribute significantly to the broader understanding of topological spin textures in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Large Fermi surface in pristine kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and enhanced quasiparticle effective masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an ideal platform to study the interplay between topology and electron correlation. To understand the fermiology of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, intensive quantum oscillation (QO) studies at ambient pressure have been conducted. However, due to the Fermi surface reconstruction by the complicated charge density wave (CDW) order, the QO spectrum is exceedingly complex, hindering a complete understanding of the fermiology. Here, we directly map the Fermi surface of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas QOs up to 29 T under pressure, where the CDW order is completely suppressed. The QO spectrum of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is significantly simpler than the one in the CDW phase, and the detected oscillation frequencies agree well with our density functional theory calculations. In particular, a frequency as large as 8,200 T is detected. Pressure-dependent QO studies further reveal a weak but noticeable enhancement of the quasiparticle effective masses on approaching the critical pressure where the CDW order disappears, hinting at the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our high-pressure QO results reveal the large, unreconstructed Fermi surface of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, paving the way to understanding the parent state of this intriguing metal in which the electrons can be organized into different ordered states.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic ferromagnetotriakontadipolar order and spin splitting in hematite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that hematite, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, below its Morin transition, has a ferroic ordering of rank-5 magnetic triakontadipoles on the Fe ions. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, these are the lowest-order ferroically aligned magnetic multipoles, and they give rise to the $g$-wave non-relativistic spin splitting in hematite. We find that the ferroically ordered magnetic triakontadipoles result from the simultaneous antiferroic ordering of the charge hexadecapoles and the magnetic dipoles, providing a route to manipulating the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic triakontadipoles as well as the spin splitting. Furthermore, we find that both the ferroic ordering of the magnetic triakontadipoles and many of the spin-split features persist in the weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetocaloric effect and phase separation induced by~giant van Hove singularity in itinerant ferromagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic phase separation and magnetocaloric effect is considered within the Hubbard model for face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with giant van Hove singularity of electron spectrum at band bottom. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation it is shown that such model of itinerant magnet exhibits the~first-order ferromagnet-paramagnet phase transition~(FOPT) with phase separation and inverse magnetocaloric effect deep inside the phase separation region. The thermodynamic theory based on Landau expansion for grand potential for the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is developed for phase-separated state. It is rigorously shown that ferromagnetic phase involved in the phase separated state exhibits negative magnetic susceptibility in the vicinity of~tricritical point. Thus, an entropy of the magnetically ordered phase %in the phase separated regime may increase when the magnetic field is applied which implies inverse character of the total magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$. % for the magnetocaloric effect. Temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ for the mean-field solution of the non-degenerate Hubbard model is analyzed in detail for different band filling values. The possibility to control $\Delta S$ sign by changing both the temperature and the band filling of magnetocaloric materials is demonstrated and this seems to be promising from the point of view of interpretation a lot of experimental data and possible technological applications. It is shown that giant van Hove singularity, being a main cause of phase separation, strongly affects temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ in the vicinity of tricritical point.</description>

      <title>A coherence sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced activation of chiral-phonon emission in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and phonons in strained monolayer WS$_2$ following photoexcitation. We show that strain substantially modifies the phase space for electron-phonon scattering, unlocking new relaxation pathways that are unavailable in the pristine monolayer. In particular, strain triggers a transition between distinct dynamical regimes of the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics characterized by the emission of chiral phonons under high strain and linearly-polarized phonons under low strain. For valley-polarized electronic excitations, this mechanism can be exploited to selectively activate the emission of chiral phonons -- phonons carrying a net angular momentum. Our simulations are based on state-of-the-art ab-initio methods and focus exclusively on realistic excitation and strain conditions that have already been achieved in recent experimental studies. Overall, strain emerges as a powerful tool for controlling chiral phonons emission and relaxation pathways in multivalley quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: The significant advancements in perovskite solar cell (PSC) research and development have reignited optimism for the practicality of solar energy. A deeper comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms is essential for enhancing the current solar technology. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization, in conjunction with other analytical methods, stands out as the primary approach for gaining insights into the internal workings of solar cells. The continuous analysis and refinement of electrochemical spectroscopy data for PSCs have unveiled intricate operational details. Despite the ongoing improvements, the absence of a centralized repository for this information poses challenges for tracking progress effectively. This review paper aims to consolidate the physical phenomena behind the development of PSC research, aiming to establish a comprehensive knowledge base on impedance plots, equivalent circuits, and related processes.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in vdW Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical readout of magnetic states is a key to realize novel spintronics devices for efficient computing and data storage. Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in bilayer systems, consisting of a spin source material and a magnetic layer, refers to a change in the longitudinal resistance upon the reversal of magnetization, which typically originates from the interaction of spin-current and magnetization at the interface. Because of UMR s linear dependence on applied charge current and magnetization, it can be used to electrically read the magnetization state. However, in conventional spin source materials, the spin polarization of an electric field induced spin current is restricted to be in the film plane and hence the ensuing UMR can only respond to the in plane component of the magnetization. On the other hand, magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are highly desired for magnetic memory and spin-logic devices, while the electrical read out of PMA magnets through UMR is critically missing. Here, we report the discovery of an unconventional UMR in bilayer heterostructures of a topological semimetal (WTe2) and a PMA ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6, CGT), which allows to electrically read the up and down magnetic states of the CGT layer by measuring the longitudinal resistance. Our theoretical calculations based on a tight binding model show that the unconventional UMR originates from the interplay of crystal symmetry breaking in WTe2 and magnetic exchange interaction across the WTe2 and CGT interface. Combining with the ability of WTe2 to obtain magnetic field free switching of the PMA magnets, our discoveries open an exciting pathway to achieve two terminal magnetic memory devices that operate solely on the spin orbit torque and UMR, which is critical for developing next-generation non volatile and low power consumption data storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement and Quantum Correlations in Condensed Matter: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and certification of entanglement and quantum correlations in materials is of fundamental and far-reaching importance, and has seen significant recent progress. It impacts both our understanding of the basic science of quantum many-body phenomena as well as the identification of systems suitable for novel technologies. Frameworks suitable to condensed matter that connect measurements to entanglement and coherence have been developed in the context of quantum information theory. These take the form of entanglement witnesses and quantum correlation measures.
  The underlying theory of these quantities, their relation to condensed matter experimental techniques, and their application to real materials are comprehensively reviewed. In addition, their usage in e.g. protocols, the relative advantages and disadvantages of witnesses and measures, and future prospects in, e.g., correlated electrons, entanglement dynamics, and entangled spectroscopic probes, are presented. Consideration is given to the interdisciplinary nature of this emerging research and substantial ongoing progress by providing an accessible and practical treatment from fundamentals to application. Particular emphasis is placed on quantities accessible to collective measurements, including by susceptibility and spectroscopic techniques. This includes the magnetic susceptibility witness, one-tangle, concurrence and two-tangle, two-site quantum discord, and quantum coherence measures such as the quantum Fisher information.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical model for charge transfer along ion chains in silicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model, several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.</description>

      <title>The role of Debye temperature in achieving large adiabatic temperature changes at cryogenic temperatures: a case study on $Pr_2In$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excellent magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) in the temperature range of 20 $\sim$ 77 K due to the first-order phase transition makes $Pr_2In$ an intriguing candidate for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. As an equally important magnetocaloric parameter, the adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}$) of $Pr_2In$ associated with the first-order phase transition has not yet been reported. In this work, the $\Delta T_{ad}$ of $Pr_2In$ is obtained from heat capacity measurements: 2 K in fields of 2 T and 4.3 K in fields of 5 T. While demonstrating a $\Delta T_{ad}$ that is not as impressive as its remarkable $\Delta S_T$, $Pr_2In$ exhibits an unusual low Debye temperature ($T_D$) of around 110 K. Based on these two observations, an approach that combines the mean-field and Debye models is developed to study the correlation between $\Delta T_{ad}$ and $T_D$. The role of $T_D$ in achieving large $\Delta T_{ad}$ is revealed: materials with higher $T_D$ tend to exhibit larger $\Delta T_{ad}$, particularly in the cryogenic temperature range. This discovery explains the absence of an outstanding $\Delta T_{ad}$ in $Pr_2In$ and can serve as a tool for designing or searching materials with both a large $\Delta S_T$ and a $\Delta T_{ad}$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Ternary Carbides trained on the AFLOW Database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large density functional theory (DFT) databases are a treasure trove of energies, forces and stresses that can be used to train machine learned interatomic potentials for atomistic modeling. Herein, we employ structural relaxations from the AFLOW database to train moment tensor potentials (MTPs) for four carbide systems: HfTaC, HfZrC, MoWC and TaTiC. The resulting MTPs are used to relax ~6300 random symmetric structures, and are subsequently improved via active learning to generate robust potentials (RP) that can relax a wide variety of structures, and accurate potentials (AP) designed for the relaxation of low-energy systems. This protocol is shown to yield convex hulls that are indistinguishable from those predicted by AFLOW for the HfTaC, HfZrC and TaTiC systems, and in the case of the MoWC system to predict thermodynamically stable structures that are not found within AFLOW, highlighting the potential of the employed protocol within crystal structure prediction. Relaxation of over three hundred Mo$_{1-x}$W$_x$C stoichiometry crystals first with the RP then with the AP yields formation enthalpies that are in excellent agreement with those obtained via DFT.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal nanowires from topological crystalline insulators: a platform for intrinsic core-shell nanowires and higher-order topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental realization of Pb1-xSnxTe pentagonal nanowires (NWs) with [110] orientation using molecular beam epitaxy techniques. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural stability in NWs of SnTe and PbTe in three different structural phases: cubic, pentagonal with [001] orientation and pentagonal with [110] orientation. Within a semiclassical approach, we show that the interplay between ionic and covalent bonds favors the formation of pentagonal NWs. Additionally, we find that this pentagonal structure is more likely to occur in tellurides than in selenides. The disclination and twin boundary cause the electronic states originating from the NW core region to generate a conducting band connecting the valence and conduction bands, creating a symmetry-enforced metallic phase. The metallic core band has opposite slopes in the cases of Sn and Te twin boundary, while the bands from the shell are insulating. We finally study the electronic and topological properties of pentagonal NWs unveiling their potential as a new platform for higher-order topology and fractional charge. These pentagonal NWs represent a unique case of intrinsic core-shell one-dimensional nanostructures with distinct structural, electronic and topological properties between the core and the shell region.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band structure and excitonic optical response in V2O5 bulk and monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of V$_2$O$_5$ is calculated using an all-electron quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ method, including electron-hole ladder diagrams in the screening of $W$. The optical dielectric function calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation exhibits excitons with large binding energy, consistent with spectroscopic ellipsometry data and other recent calculations. Sharp peaks in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high energy are found to be an artifact of the truncation of the numbers of bands included in the BSE calculation of the macroscopic dielectric function. The $\varepsilon_1(\omega=0)$ gives indices of refraction in good agreement with experiment. The excitons are charge transfer excitons with the hole primarily on oxygen and electrons on vanadium, but depending on which exciton, the distribution over different oxygens changes. The exciton wave functions have a spread of about 5-15\AA, with asymmetric character for the electron distribution around the hole depending on which oxygen the hole is fixed at. The monolayer quasiparticle gap increases inversely proportional to interlayer distance once the initial interlayer covalent couplings are removed which is thanks to the long-range nature of the self-energy and the reduced screening in a 2D system. The optical gap on the other hand is relatively independent of interlayer spacing because of the compensation between the self-energy gap shift and the exciton binding energy, both of which are proportional to the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$. Recent experimental results on very thin layer V$_2$O$_5$ obtained by chemical exfoliation provide experimental support for an increase in gap.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Mechanistic Insights into the Tension-Compression Asymmetry of Rapidly Solidified Fe-Cr Alloys: A Phase Field and Strain Gradient Plasticity Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid solidification in Additively Manufactured (AM) metallic materials results in the development of significant microscale internal stresses, which are attributed to the printing induced dislocation substructures. The resulting backstress due to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations (GNDs) is responsible for the observed Tension-Compression (TC) asymmetry. We propose a combined Phase Field (PF)-Strain Gradient $J_2$ Plasticity (SGP) framework to investigate the TC asymmetry in such microstructures. The proposed PF model is an extension of Kobayashi's dendritic growth framework, modified to account for the orientation-based anisotropy and multi-grain interaction effects. The SGP model has consideration for anisotropic temperature-dependent elasticity, dislocation strengthening, solid solution strengthening, along with GND-induced directional backstress. This model is employed to predict the solute segregation, dislocation substructure and backstress development during solidification and the post-solidification anisotropic mechanical properties in terms of the TC asymmetry of rapidly solidified Fe-Cr alloys. It is observed that higher thermal gradients (and hence, cooling rates) lead to higher magnitudes of solute segregation, GND density, and backstress. This also correlates with a corresponding increase in the predicted TC asymmetry. The results presented in this study point to the microstructural factors, such as dislocation substructure and solute segregation, and mechanistic factors, such as backstress, which may contribute to the development of TC asymmetry in rapidly solidified microstructures.</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>

      <title>Fitting to magnetic forces improves the reliability of magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fitting machine-learning interatomic potentials with magnetic degrees of freedom, namely, magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials (mMTP). The main feature of the methodology consists in fitting mMTP to magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) derived from spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We test our method on the bcc Fe-Al system with different composition. Specifically, we calculate formation energies, equilibrium lattice parameter, and total cell magnetization. Our findings demonstrate a precise match between values calculated with mMTP and those obtained by DFT at zero temperature. Additionally, using molecular dynamics, we estimate the finite temperature lattice parameter and capture the cell expansion as was previously revealed in experiment. We demonstrate that mMTPs fitted to magnetic forces, increase the relaxation reliability, which is the percent of successfully relaxed structures (i.e. with almost zero forces, stresses, and magnetic moments after the optimization of geometry). Eventually, we show that the proposed methodology can provide an accurate and reliable mMTP with reduced number of computationally complex spin-polarized density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling and chiral spin-texture control in a dipolar 3D multilayered artificial spin-vortex ice</title>

Abstract: Strongly-interacting nanomagnetic arrays are ideal systems for exploring reconfigurable magnonics. They provide huge microstate spaces and integrated solutions for storage and neuromorphic computing alongside GHz functionality. These systems may be broadly assessed by their range of reliably accessible states and the strength of magnon coupling phenomena and nonlinearities.
  Increasingly, nanomagnetic systems are expanding into three-dimensional architectures. This has enhanced the range of available magnetic microstates and functional behaviours, but engineering control over 3D states and dynamics remains challenging.
  Here, we introduce a 3D magnonic metamaterial composed from multilayered artificial spin ice nanoarrays. Comprising two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer, each nanoisland may assume four macrospin or vortex states per magnetic layer. This creates a system with a rich $16^N$ microstate space and intense static and dynamic dipolar magnetic coupling.
  The system exhibits a broad range of emergent phenomena driven by the strong inter-layer dipolar interaction, including ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling with normalised coupling rates of $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\gamma} = 0.57$, GHz mode shifts in zero applied field and chirality-selective magneto-toroidal microstate programming and corresponding magnonic spectral control.</description>

      <title>LiHoF4 as a spin-half non-standard quantum Ising system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ is a magnetic material known for its Ising-type anisotropy, making it a model system for studying quantum magnetism. However, the theoretical description of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ using the quantum Ising model has shown discrepancies in its phase diagram, particularly in the regime dominated by thermal fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the role of off-diagonal dipolar terms in $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, previously neglected, in determining its properties. We analytically derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, including the off-diagonal dipolar terms perturbatively, both in the absence and presence of a transverse field. Our results encompass the full $B_{x}-T$ phase diagram, confirming the significance of the off-diagonal dipolar terms in reducing the zero-field critical temperature and determining the critical temperature's dependence on the transverse field. We also highlight the sensitivity of this mechanism to the crystal structure by comparing our calculations with the $\mathrm{Fe_{8}}$ system.</description>

      <title>Europium $c$-axis ferromagnetism in Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2-y}$As$_{2}$: A single-crystal neutron diffraction study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report neutron diffraction results for the body-centered-tetragonal series Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_{2-y}$As$_2$, $x=0.10$, $0.20$, $0.42$, and $0.82$, $y\leq0.10$, that detail changes to the magnetic ordering with nominal hole doping. We report the antiferromagnetic (AFM) propagation vectors, magnetic transition temperatures, and the ordered magnetic moments. We find a nonmonotonic change of the AFM propagation vector with $x$, with a minimum occurring at the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase crossover. For $x=0.10$ and $0.82$ we find $c$-axis helix ordering of the Eu magnetic moments (spins) similar to $x=0$ and $1$, with the spins oriented within the $ab$-plane. For $x=0.20$ and $0.42$ we find higher-temperature $c$-axis FM order and lower-temperature $c$-axis cone order. Using the extinction conditions for the space group, we discovered that the Eu spins are ordered in the higher-temperature $c$-axis FM phase for intermediate values of $x$, contrary to a previous report suggesting only Co/Ni spin ordering. Although we cannot directly confirm that the Co/Ni spins are also ordered, we suggest that $c$-axis itinerant-FM ordering of the Co/Ni spins could provide a molecular field that drives FM ordering of the Eu spins, which in turn provides the anisotropy for the lower-temperature $c$-axis cone order.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent quasi-particle $GW$ and hybrid functional calculations for Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions: band offset and spin-orbit coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>
