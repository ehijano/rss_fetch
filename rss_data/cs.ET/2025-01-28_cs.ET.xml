      <title>Enhancing Disaster Resilience with UAV-Assisted Edge Computing: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Managing Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge sensing and computing is rapidly becoming part of intelligent infrastructure architecture leading to operational reliance on such systems in disaster or emergency situations. In such scenarios there is a high chance of power supply failure due to power grid issues, and communication system issues due to base stations losing power or being damaged by the elements, e.g., flooding, wildfires etc. Mobile edge computing in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been proposed to provide computation offloading from these devices to conserve their battery, while the use of UAVs as relay network nodes has also been investigated previously. This paper considers the use of UAVs with further constraints on power and connectivity to prolong the life of the network while also ensuring that the data is received from the edge nodes in a timely manner. Reinforcement learning is used to investigate numerous scenarios of various levels of power and communication failure. This approach is able to identify the device most likely to fail in a given scenario, thus providing priority guidance for maintenance personnel. The evacuations of a rural town and urban downtown area are also simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach at extending the life of the most critical edge devices.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based deep q learning approach for dynamic load balancing in software-defined networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach for dynamic load balancing in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) using a Transformer-based Deep Q-Network (DQN). Traditional load balancing mechanisms, such as Round Robin (RR) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR), are static and often struggle to adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies in network performance. In contrast, SDNs offer centralized control and flexibility, providing an ideal platform for implementing machine learning-driven optimization strategies. The core of this research combines a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for accurate traffic prediction with a DQN model to perform real-time dynamic load balancing. The TFT model predicts future traffic loads, which the DQN uses as input, allowing it to make intelligent routing decisions that optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce packet loss. The proposed model was tested against RR and WRR in simulated environments with varying data rates, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in network performance. For the 500MB data rate, the DQN model achieved an average throughput of 0.275 compared to 0.202 and 0.205 for RR and WRR, respectively. Additionally, the DQN recorded lower average latency and packet loss. In the 1000MB simulation, the DQN model outperformed the traditional methods in throughput, latency, and packet loss, reinforcing its effectiveness in managing network loads dynamically. This research presents an important step towards enhancing network performance through the integration of machine learning models within SDNs, potentially paving the way for more adaptive, intelligent network management systems.</description>

      <title>Technology Mapping with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's fast-evolving business landscape, having insight into the technology stacks that organizations use is crucial for forging partnerships, uncovering market openings, and informing strategic choices. However, conventional technology mapping, which typically hinges on keyword searches, struggles with the sheer scale and variety of data available, often failing to capture nascent technologies. To overcome these hurdles, we present STARS (Semantic Technology and Retrieval System), a novel framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Sentence-BERT to pinpoint relevant technologies within unstructured content, build comprehensive company profiles, and rank each firm's technologies according to their operational importance. By integrating entity extraction with Chain-of-Thought prompting and employing semantic ranking, STARS provides a precise method for mapping corporate technology portfolios. Experimental results show that STARS markedly boosts retrieval accuracy, offering a versatile and high-performance solution for cross-industry technology mapping.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Knowledge through Reverse Annealing: A Preliminary Analysis of the Benefits and What to Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being immersed in the NISQ-era, current quantum annealers present limitations for solving optimization problems efficiently. To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.</description>

      <title>MetaDecorator: Generating Immersive Virtual Tours through Multimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MetaDecorator, is a framework that empowers users to personalize virtual spaces. By leveraging text-driven prompts and image synthesis techniques, MetaDecorator adorns static panoramas captured by 360{\deg} imaging devices, transforming them into uniquely styled and visually appealing environments. This significantly enhances the realism and engagement of virtual tours compared to traditional offerings. Beyond the core framework, we also discuss the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and haptics in the VR application to provide a more immersive experience.</description>

      <title>Convolutions with Radio-Frequency Spin-Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for applications in robotics, traffic control, and medical devices. Spintronic devices, which respond to RF signals via ferromagnetic resonance, offer a promising solution. Recent studies have shown that a neural network of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can classify RF signals without digitization. However, the complexity of these junctions poses challenges for rapid scaling. In this work, we demonstrate that simple spintronic devices, known as metallic spin-diodes, can effectively perform RF classification. These devices consist of NiFe/Pt bilayers and can implement weighted sums of RF inputs. We experimentally show that chains of four spin-diodes can execute 2x2 pixel filters, achieving high-quality convolutions on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Integrating the hardware spin-diodes in a software network, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 88 \% on the first 100 images, compared to 88.4 \% for full software with noise, and 90 \% without noise.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Iterative Compression for High-Resolution Files: an Approach Focused on Preserving Visual Quality in Cinematic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an iterative adaptive compression model for high-resolution DPX-derived TIFF files used in cinematographic workflows and digital preservation. The model employs SSIM and PSNR metrics to dynamically adjust compression parameters across three configurations (C0, C1, C2), achieving storage reductions up to 83.4 % while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM &gt; 0.95). Validation across three diverse productions - black and white classic, soft-palette drama, and complex action film - demonstrated the method's effectiveness in preserving critical visual elements while significantly reducing storage requirements. Professional evaluators reported 90% acceptance rate for the optimal C1 configuration, with artifacts remaining below perceptual threshold in critical areas. Comparative analysis with JPEG2000 and H.265 showed superior quality preservation at equivalent compression rates, particularly for high bit-depth content. While requiring additional computational overhead, the method's storage benefits and quality control capabilities make it suitable for professional workflows, with potential applications in medical imaging and cloud storage optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for the Problem of Security for Cognition in Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue, but applied efforts have been relatively limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address these security issues is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Neurosecurity, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Neurosecurity, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$. We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT). Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>
