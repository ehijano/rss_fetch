      <title>Evaluation of the infectivity of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on swine vehicles after cleaning and disinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biosecurity measures enforced by the swine industry are in place not only to protect a single farm, but also the vast community of interconnected swine farms. Vehicles play a role in disease movement and given that most pigs move throughout the system multiple times during their lives, vehicle cleanliness is key to preventing disease spread. The objective of this study was to determine the infectivity of PEDV on various swine industry vehicles and evaluate the associated cleaning and disinfection (C&amp;D) methods. Viral swabs were collected from various locations on swine industry vehicles and were used to make the bioassay inoculums which were given to a total of 54 piglets enrolled across two bioassays: a pilot bioassay to ensure the samples were collected and stored in a way that preserved the virus, and a full bioassay testing samples collected from vehicles post C&amp;D. The piglets enrolled in the pilot bioassay tested positive for PEDV within 48 hours, confirming the methods were appropriate and capable of infecting piglets with PEDV. From the full bioassay, the piglets inoculated with samples collected from inside the pigs-to-market vehicle cabins experienced severe diarrhea and tested positive for PEDV. No other experimental treatment group experienced persistent clinical symptoms of PEDV in the full bioassay, suggesting the concentration of infectious PEDV remaining after C&amp;D was not enough to cause severe PED in healthy piglets. However, the cleaning efficacy varied greatly across vehicle types, suggesting that producers should continue to uphold and improve vehicle C&amp;D.</description>

      <title>Genetic Profile-Based Drug Sensitivity Prediction in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Using SVR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive blood cancer with low survival rates. Hence, emphasizing the importance of the urgent need for effective treatment modalities. In recent times, the advances in cancer genomics have increased our understanding of AML, as a result, enabling precision oncologists to develop personalized treatment based on individual genetic features and increase the survival rate. However, there is a lack of understanding of how effectively genetic features can be used to predict which drugs are the most suitable for individual-tailored treatment. Therefore, this study explores the potential of Support Vector Regression (SVR) in predicting drug sensitivity of AML patients solely based on their genetic profile. The paper utilized a dataset from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity (GDSC) and developed a precise model that identified the most significant genetic features affecting drug response and achieved promising results with an R-squared score of 0.9523 on the validation set and 0.8928 on the test set.</description>
