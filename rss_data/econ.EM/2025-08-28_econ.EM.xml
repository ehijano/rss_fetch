      <title>Inference on Partially Identified Parameters with Separable Nuisance Parameters: a Two-Stage Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a two-stage method for inference on partially identified parameters in moment inequality models with separable nuisance parameters. In the first stage, the nuisance parameters are estimated separately, and in the second stage, the identified set for the parameters of interest is constructed using a refined chi-squared test with variance correction that accounts for the first-stage estimation error. We establish the asymptotic validity of the proposed method under mild conditions and characterize its finite-sample properties. The method is broadly applicable to models where direct elimination of nuisance parameters is difficult or introduces conservativeness. Its practical performance is illustrated through an application: structural estimation of entry and exit costs in the U.S. vehicle market based on Wollmann (2018).</description>

      <title>The purpose of an estimator is what it does: Misspecification, estimands, and over-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In over-identified models, misspecification -- the norm rather than exception -- fundamentally changes what estimators estimate. Different estimators imply different estimands rather than different efficiency for the same target. A review of recent applications of generalized method of moments in the American Economic Review suggests widespread acceptance of this fact: There is little formal specification testing and widespread use of estimators that would be inefficient were the model correct, including the use of "hand-selected" moments and weighting matrices. Motivated by these observations, we review and synthesize recent results on estimation under model misspecification, providing guidelines for transparent and robust empirical research. We also provide a new theoretical result, showing that Hansen's J-statistic measures, asymptotically, the range of estimates achievable at a given standard error. Given the widespread use of inefficient estimators and the resulting researcher degrees of freedom, we thus particularly recommend the broader reporting of J-statistics.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model for time series modelling and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hierarchical Bayesian framework is introduced for developing tree-based mixture models for time series, partly motivated by applications in finance and forecasting. At the top level, meaningful discrete states are identified as appropriately quantised values of some of the most recent samples. At the bottom level, a different, arbitrary base model is associated with each state. This defines a very general framework that can be used in conjunction with any existing model class to build flexible and interpretable mixture models. We call this the Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model, or the BCT-X framework. Appropriate algorithmic tools are described, which allow for effective and efficient Bayesian inference and learning; these algorithms can be updated sequentially, facilitating online forecasting. The utility of the general framework is illustrated in the particular instances when AR or ARCH models are used as base models. The latter results in a mixture model that offers a powerful way of modelling the well-known volatility asymmetries in financial data, revealing a novel, important feature of stock market index data, in the form of an enhanced leverage effect. In forecasting, the BCT-X methods are found to outperform several state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of accuracy and computational requirements.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>
