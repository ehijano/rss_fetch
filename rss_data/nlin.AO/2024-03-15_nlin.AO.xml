      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Synchronized states of power grids and oscillator networks by convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is essential for the operation of AC power systems: All generators in the power grid must rotate with fixed relative phases to enable a steady flow of electric power. Understanding the conditions for and the limitations of synchronization is of utmost practical importance. In this article, we propose a novel approach to compute and analyze the stable stationary states of a power grid or an oscillator network in terms of a convex optimization problem. This approach allows to systematically compute \emph{all} stable states where the phase difference across an edge does not exceed $\pi/2$.Furthermore, the optimization formulation allows to rigorously establish certain properties of synchronized states and to bound the error in the widely used linear power flow approximation.</description>

      <title>Universal Slow Dynamics of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergent behavior of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a fundamental aspect of biology and its origin from inanimate matter. A closed CRN monotonically tends to thermal equilibrium, but when it is opened to external reservoirs, a range of behaviors is possible, including transition to a new equilibrium state, a non-equilibrium state, or indefinite growth. This study shows that slowly driven CRNs are governed by the conserved quantities of the closed system, which are generally far fewer in number than the species. Considering both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, a universal slow dynamics equation is derived with singular perturbation methods, and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. The slow dynamics is highly robust against microscopic details of the network, which may be unknown in practical situations. In particular, non-equilibrium states of realistic large CRNs can be sought without knowledge of bulk reaction rates. The framework is successfully tested against a suite of networks of increasing complexity and argued to be relevant in the treatment of open CRNs as chemical machines.</description>
