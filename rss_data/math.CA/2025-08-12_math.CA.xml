      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>

      <title>From Lipschitz embedding to Lipschitz equivalence between dust-like self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K,F\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be two dust-like self-similar sets sharing the same Hausdorff dimension. We consider when the mere existence of a Lipschitz embedding from $K$ to $F$ already implies their Lipschitz equivalence. Our main result is threefold: (1) if the Lipschitz image of $K$ intersects $F$ in a set of positive Hausdorff measure, then $K$ admits a Lipschitz surjection onto $F$; (2) if $F$ is in addition homogeneous, then the generating iterated function systems of $K, F$ should have algebraically dependent ratios and consequently, $K$ and $F$ are Lipschitz equivalent; (3) the Lipschitz equivalence can fail without the homogeneity assumption. This answers two questions in Balka and Keleti [Adv. Math. 446 (2024), 109669].</description>

      <title>Bounded lattice tiles that pack with another lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose L and M are full-rank lattices in Euclidean space, such that vol(L) &lt; vol(M). Answering a question of Han and Wang from 2001, we show how to construct a bounded measurable set F (we can even take F to be a finite union of polytopes) such that F+L is a tiling and F+M is a packing. If we do not require measurability of F it is often possible that a set F can be found tiling with both L and M even when L and M have different volumes, for instance if their intersection is trivial. We also show here that such a set can never be bounded if L and M have different volumes.</description>

      <title>Integral representation for a product of two Jacobi functions of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By starting with Durand's double integral representation for a product of two Jacobi functions of the second kind, we derive an integral representation for a product of two Jacobi functions of the second kind in kernel form. We also derive a Bateman-type sum for a product of two Jacobi functions of the second kind. From this integral representation we derive integral representations for the Jacobi function of the first kind in both the hyperbolic and trigonometric contexts. From the integral representations for Jacobi functions, we also derive integral representations for products of limiting functions such as associated Legendre functions of the first and second kind, Ferrers functions and also Gegenbauer functions of the first and second kind. By examining the behavior of one of these products near singularities of the relevant functions, we also derive integral representations for single functions, including a Laplace-type integral representation for the Jacobi function of the second kind. Finally, we use the product formulas for the functions of the second kind to derive Nicholson-type integral relations for the sums of squares of Jacobi functions of the first and second kinds, and in a confluent limit, Laguerre functions of the first and second kinds, which generalize the relation $\expe^{ix}\expe^{-ix}=1$ to those functions.</description>

      <title>Existence of Anisotropic Minkowski Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the existence of anisotropic Minkowski content and anisotropic outer Minkowski content. Our result is that the Minkowski content of the topological boundary of a given set of finite perimeter $E$ coincides with the perimeter of $E$ if and only if the anisotropic Minkowski content of the topological boundary of $E$ coincides with half of the sum of the anisotropic perimeter of $E$ and the anisotropic perimeter of the complement of $E$. As a consequence, we find that the existence of anisotropic outer Minkowski content of a given set of finite perimeter and its complement ensures the existence of outer Minkowski content of the set and its complement.</description>

      <title>Terminating representations, transformations and summations for the $q$ and $q^{-1}$-symmetric subfamilies of the Askey--Wilson polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we exhaustively explore the terminating basic hypergeometric representations and transformations of the $q$ and $q^{-1}$-symmetric subfamilies of the Askey--Wilson polynomials. These subfamilies are obtained by repeatedly setting one of the free parameters (not $q$) equal to zero until no parameters are left. These subfamilies (and their $q^{-1}$ counterparts) are the continuous dual $q$-Hahn, Al-Salam--Chihara, continuous big $q$-Hermite, and the continuous $q$-Hermite polynomials. From the terminating basic hypergeometric representations of these polynomials, and due to symmetry in their free parameters, we are able to exhaustively explore the terminating basic hypergeometric transformation formulas which these polynomials satisfy. We then study the terminating transformation structure which are implied by the terminating representations of these polynomials. We conclude by describing the symmetry group structure of the $q$-Askey scheme.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of n-centre billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of mechanical billiards, where a particle moves in a planar region under the influence of an n-centre potential and reflects elastically on a straight wall. Motivated by Boltzmann's original billiard model we explore when such systems fail to be integrable. We show that for any positive energy, if there are at least two centres and the wall is placed sufficiently far away, the billiard dynamics is necessarily non-integrable and exhibits chaotic behaviour. In the classical Newtonian two-centre problem, we identify a simple geometric condition on the wall that likewise guarantees chaos, even though the free two-centre system is integrable.</description>

Abstract: An $A^{(1)*}_2$-surface is a space of initial conditions of certain difference Painlev\'e equations. $A^{(1)*}_2$-surfaces are realized as the moduli spaces of parabolic logarithmic connections.

      <title>Recent Progress on Fractal Percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey paper about the fractal percolation process, also known as Mandelbrot percolation. It is intended to give a general breadth overview of more recent research in the topic, but also includes some of the more classical results, for example related to the connectivity properties. Particular emphasis is put on the dimension theory of the limiting set and also on the geometry of the non-trivial connected components in the supercritical regime. In particular, we show that both the Assouad spectrum and intermediate dimensions of the non-trivial connected components are constant equal to its box dimension despite its Hausdorff, box and Assouad dimensions known to being distinct.</description>

      <title>On the attainability of singular Wiener bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the lower and upper attainability of the Wiener bound (also known as Voigt-Reuss bound) for singularly distributed conductive material mixtures. For the lower attainability we consider mixtures in which high-conductance materials support on sets having finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measures. We show that, under a mild coercivity condition, the kernel of the effective tensor of the mixture is equal to the orthogonal complement of the homotopy classes of closed paths in the supporting set. This shows that a periodic planar network has positive definite effective tensor, i.e., it is resilient to fluctuations, if and only if the network is reticulate. We provide a geometric characterization of the upper attainability by applying a transformation from varifolds to matrix-valued measures. We show that this transformation leads to an equivalence between two distinct notions from material science and geometric measure theory respectively: conductance maximality and area criticality. Based on this relation we show a pointwise dimension bound for mixtures that attain the upper Wiener bound by applying a fractional version of the monotonicity formula for stationary varifolds. This dimension bound illustrates how the maximality condition constrains the local anisotropy and the local distribution of conductance magnitudes. Both the lower and upper attainability results have potential novel applications in modeling leaf venation patterns.</description>

      <title>Weighted $L^p\to L^q$-boundedness of commutators and paraproducts in the Bloom setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As our main result, we supply the missing characterization of the $L^p(\mu)\to L^q(\lambda)$ boundedness of the commutator of a non-degenerate Calder\'on--Zygmund operator $T$ and pointwise multiplication by $b$ for exponents $1&lt;q&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and Muckenhoupt weights $\mu\in A_p$ and $\lambda\in A_q$. Namely, the commutator $[b,T]\colon L^p(\mu)\to L^q(\lambda)$ is bounded if and only if $b$ satisfies the following new, cancellative condition: $$M^\#_\nu b\in L^{pq/(p-q)}(\nu),$$ where $M^\#_\nu b$ is the weighted sharp maximal function defined by $$ M^\#_\nu b:=\sup_{Q} \frac{\mathbf{1}_Q}{\nu(Q)} \int_{Q} |b-\langle b\rangle_Q |\,\mathrm{d}x$$ and $\nu$ is the Bloom weight defined by $\nu^{1/p+1/q'}:= \mu^{1/p} \lambda^{-1/q}$.
  In the unweighted case $\mu=\lambda=1$, by a result of Hyt\"onen the boundedness of the commutator $[b,T]$ is, after factoring out constants, characterized by the boundedness of pointwise multiplication by $b$, which amounts to the non-cancellative condition $b\in L^{pq/(p-q)}$. We provide a counterexample showing that this characterization breaks down in the weighted case $\mu\in A_p$ and $\lambda\in A_q$. Therefore, the introduction of our new, cancellative condition is necessary.
  In parallel to commutators, we also characterize the weighted boundedness of dyadic paraproducts $\Pi_b$ in the missing exponent range $p\neq q$. Combined with previous results in the complementary exponent ranges, our results complete the characterisation of the weighted boundedness of both commutators and of paraproducts for all exponents $p,q \in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental inequalities for the iterated Fourier-cosine convolution with Gaussian weight and its application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derived from the results in [Giang et al.: \emph{Convolutions for the Fourier transforms with geometric variables and applications}, Math. Nachr. 283(12) (2010), 1758--1770], in this paper, we devoted to studying the boundedness properties for the Fourier-cosine convolution weighted by a Gaussian function of the form $\gamma =\exp(-\frac{1}{2}y^2)$ via Young's type theorem and Saitoh's type inequality. New norm estimations in the weighted space are obtained, and the application of the corresponding class of convolutions in Fredholm's second kind of integral equation is discussed. The conditions for the solvability of this equation on the $L_1$ space are also found, along with the analysis of an illustrative numerical example, which exemplifies that the present object and method solve cases that are not under the conditions of previously known techniques.</description>

Our function was found using simulated annealing and gradient based methods rather than using large language models.</description>

Abstract: For the nonlocal quasilinear fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$ with $s\in (0,1)$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$, we investigate the nonexistence and existence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions $u$ in the local fractional Sobolev space $W_{\rm loc}^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ that satisfies the inequality $(-\Delta)^s_p u\ge u^q$ weakly in $\mathbb R^n$, where $q\in(0,\infty)$. The approach taken in this paper is mainly based on some delicate analysis of the fundamental solutions to the fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$.</description>

Abstract: We study an important special case of the differential elimination problem: given a polynomial parametric dynamical system $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{g}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{x})$ and a polynomial observation function $y = f(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{x})$, find the minimal differential equation satisfied by $y$. In our previous work, for the case $y = x_1$, we established a bound on the support of such a differential equation for the non-parametric case and shown that it can be turned into an algorithm via the evaluation-interpolation approach. The main contribution of the present paper is a generalization of the aforementioned result in two directions: to allow any polynomial function $y = f(\mathbf{x})$, not just a single coordinate, and to allow $\mathbf{g}$ and $f$ depend on unknown symbolic parameters. We conduct computation experiments to evaluate the accuracy of our new bound and show that the approach allows to perform elimination for some cases out of reach for the state of the art software.</description>
