      <title>Elucidating the cellular determinants of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship of the heart via computational modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVr) is a key indicator of cardiac contractility. Despite its established importance, several studies suggested that the mechanical mode of contraction, such as isovolumetric or ejecting contractions, may affect the ESPVr, challenging the traditional notion of a single, consistent relationship. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the observed effects of ejection on force generation are inherent to the ventricular chamber itself or are a fundamental property of the myocardial tissue, with the underlying mechanisms remaining poorly understood. We investigated these aspects by using a multiscale in silico model that allowed us to elucidate the links between subcellular mechanisms and organ-level function. Simulations of ejecting and isovolumetric beats with different preload and afterload resistance were performed by modulating calcium and cross-bridge kinetics. The results suggest that the ESPVr is not a fixed curve but depends on the mechanical history of the contraction, with potentially both positive and negative effects of ejection. Isolated tissue simulations suggest that these phenomena are intrinsic to the myocardial tissue, rather than properties of the ventricular chamber. Our results suggest that the ESPVr results from the balance of positive and negative effects of ejection, respectively related to a memory effect of the increased apparent calcium sensitivity at high sarcomere length, and to the inverse relationship between force and velocity. Numerical simulations allowed us to reconcile conflicting results in the literature and suggest translational implications for clinical conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where altered calcium dynamics and cross-bridge kinetics may impact the ESPVr.</description>

      <title>Glucose Sensing Using Pristine and Co-doped Hematite Fiber-Optic sensors: Experimental and DFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glucose monitoring plays a critical role in managing diabetes, one of the most prevalent diseases globally. The development of fast-responsive, cost-effective, and biocompatible glucose sensors is essential for improving patient care. In this study, a comparative analysis is conducted between pristine and Co-doped hematite samples, synthesized via the hydrothermal method, to evaluate their structural, morphological, and optical properties. The glucose sensing performance of both samples is assessed using a fiber-optic evanescent wave (FOEW) setup. While the sensitivity remains comparable for both pristine and Co-doped hematite, a reduction in the Limit of Detection (LoD) is observed in the Co-doped sample, suggesting enhanced interactions with glucose molecules at the surface. To gain further insights into the glucose adsorption mechanisms, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed, revealing key details regarding charge transfer, electronic delocalization, and glucose binding on the hematite surfaces. These findings highlight the potential of Co-doped hematite for advanced glucose sensing applications, offering a valuable synergy between experimental and theoretical approaches for further exploration in biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for inter-fraction head and neck anatomical changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the performance of a probabilistic deep learning based algorithm for predicting inter-fraction anatomical changes in head and neck patients.
  Approach: A probabilistic daily anatomy model for head and neck patients $(\mathrm{DAM}_{\mathrm{HN}})$ is built on the variational autoencoder architecture. The model approximates the generative joint conditional probability distribution of the repeat computed tomography (rCT) images and their corresponding masks on the planning CT images (pCT) and their masks. The model outputs deformation vector fields, which are used to produce possible rCTs and associated masks. The dataset is composed of 93 patients (i.e., 367 pCT - rCT pairs), 9 (i.e., 37 pairs) of which were set aside for final testing. The performance of the model is assessed based on the reconstruction accuracy and the generative performance for the set aside patients.
  Main results: The model achieves a DICE score of 0.92 and an image similarity score of 0.65 on the test set. The generated parotid glands volume change distributions and center of mass shift distributions were also assessed. For both, the medians of the distributions are close to the true ones, and the distributions are broad enough to encompass the real observed changes. Moreover, the generated images display anatomical changes in line with the literature reported ones, such as the medial shifts of the parotids glands.
  Significance: $(\mathrm{DAM}_{\mathrm{HN}})$ is capable of generating realistic anatomies observed during the course of the treatment and has applications in anatomical robust optimization, treatment planning based on plan library approaches and robustness evaluation against inter-fractional changes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n=4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3$\pm$8.3 minutes, which is an order-of-magnitude faster than comparable alternatives. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0$\pm$0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results (Pearson's r&gt;0.98, p&lt;0.0001).</description>

      <title>Disposable Opto-Acoustic Window Enabled Cost-effective Photoacoustic-Ultrasound Dual-modal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and ultrasound imaging (USI) are important biomedical imaging techniques, due to their unique and complementary advantages in tissue's structure and function visualization. In this Letter, we proposed a coaxial photoacoustic-ultrasound dual-modal imaging system (coPAUS) with disposable opto-acoustic window. This opto-acoustic window allows part of light to go through it, and another part of light to be converted to ultrasound transmission signal by photoacoustic effect. By single laser pulse illumination, both PA signals and reflected US signals can be generated. Then, a linear array probe receives both PA and US signals, enabling simultaneous dual-modal PA and US imaging. Ex vivo experiments were conducted involving pencil lead, hair, and plastic tube with black spot, as well as in vivo experiment on human finger. The system's resolutions for PA and US imaging are 215 um and 91.125 um, with signal-to-noise ratios for PA and US signals reached up to 37.48 dB and 29.75 dB, respectively, proving the feasibility of the coPAUS dual-modal imaging. The proposed coPAUS system with disposable opto-acoustic window provides an immediate and cost-effective approach to enable US imaging capability based on an existing PA imaging system.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of a Novel Scintillator Array for In Vivo Monitoring During UHDR PBS Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Ultra-high dose rate proton therapy shows promise in tissue sparing by enhancing therapeutic ratio through the FLASH effect. In radiotherapy, accurate in vivo dosimetry is crucial for quality assurance, but remains challenging for UHDR as existing systems lack spatial and temporal resolution to verify dose and dose rate in complex anatomical regions, especially for PBS proton therapy. Purpose: To develop and evaluate a novel 3D surface dosimetry method for UHDR PBS proton therapy using high-speed imaging of a scintillator array for real-time, high-resolution surface dose monitoring. The spatial, temporal, and dosimetric components are validated via imaging of a QA phantom and comparison against TPS predictions. Methods: A deformable multi-element scintillator array was designed with 7.5mm element pitch and 0.5mm inter-element gap. Scintillation linearity with dose was evaluated with variation in response to increasing imaging and irradiation angles. WED testing evaluated beam attenuation at two energy levels. Scintillation emission was imaged at 1kHz and mesh position was monitored via 2-camera stereovision. System setup was validated using a 3D QA phantom to assess spatial accuracy and guide setup correction. Stereovision properties of array elements guided angular correction and geometric transformation. Kernel-based residual spot fitting derived cumulative dose maps compared to TPS dose profile of 5x5cm UHDR PBS delivery using 3%/2mm gamma analysis. PBS and maximum dose rate maps were calculated. Results: Setup achieved average localization error of 0.62 mm, surpassing typical 1+ mm clinical threshold. Intensity correction based on angular information yielded cumulative spot dose uncertainty of ~1% (5.428mGy). Processed dose map compared to TPS via gamma analysis showed 99.9% passing rate at 3%/2mm. WED of the array measured 1.1mm, minimizing impact on dose distribution.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Low-field MRI: Compressed Sensing and AI for fast noise-robust imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable, low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners are increasingly being deployed in clinical settings. However, critical barriers to their widespread use include low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), generally low image quality, and long scan duration. As these systems can operate in unusual environments, the level and spectral characteristics of the environmental electromagnetic inference (EMI) noise can change substantially across sites and scans, further reducing image quality. Methods for accelerating acquisition and boosting image quality are of critical importance to enable clinically actionable high-quality imaging in these systems. Despite the role that compressed sensing (CS) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have had in improving image quality for high-field MRI, their adoption for low-field imaging is in its infancy, and it is unclear how robust these methods are in low SNR regimes. Here, we investigate and compare leading CS and AI-based methods for image reconstruction from subsampled data and perform a thorough analysis of their performance across a range of SNR values. We compare classical L1-wavelet CS with leading data-driven and model-driven AI methods. Experiments are performed using publicly available datasets and our own low-field and high-field experimental data. Specifically, we apply an unrolled AI network to low-field MRI, and find it outperforms competing reconstruction methods. We prospectively deploy our undersampling methods to accelerate imaging on a 6.5 mT MRI scanner. This work highlights the potential and pitfalls of advanced reconstruction techniques in low-field MRI, paving the way for broader clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of mechanical models directly from MRI spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding interpretable biomechanical models can provide insight into the functionality of organs with regard to physiology and disease. However, identifying broadly applicable dynamical models for in vivo tissue remains challenging. In this proof of concept study we propose a reconstruction framework for data-driven discovery of dynamical models from experimentally obtained undersampled MRI spectral data. The method makes use of the previously developed spectro-dynamic framework which allows for reconstruction of displacement fields at high spatial and temporal resolution required for model identification. The proposed framework combines this method with data-driven discovery of interpretable models using Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy). The design of the reconstruction algorithm is such that a symbiotic relation between the reconstruction of the displacement fields and the model identification is created. Our method does not rely on periodicity of the motion. It is successfully validated using spectral data of a dynamic phantom gathered on a clinical MRI scanner. The dynamic phantom is programmed to perform motion adhering to 5 different (non-linear) ordinary differential equations. The proposed framework performed better than a 2-step approach where the displacement fields were first reconstructed from the undersampled data without any information on the model, followed by data-driven discovery of the model using the reconstructed displacement fields. This study serves as a first step in the direction of data-driven discovery of in vivo models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Classical X-ray Ghost Imaging for Dose Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional technique that combines information from two correlated patterned light fields to compute an image of the object of interest. GI can be performed with visible light as well as penetrating radiation such as x-rays, electrons, etc. Penetrating radiation is usually ionizing and damages biological specimens; therefore, minimising the dose of this radiation in a medical or biological imaging context is important. GI has been proposed as a potential way to achieve this. With prior knowledge of the object of interest, such as sparsity in a specific basis (e.g., Fourier basis) or access to a large dataset for neural network training, it is possible to reconstruct an image of the object with a limited number of measurements. However, low sampling does not inherently equate to low dose. Here, we specifically explore the scenario where reduced sampling corresponds to low-dose conditions. In this simulation-based paper, we examine how deep learning (DL) techniques could reduce dose in classical x-ray GI. Since GI is based on illumination patterns, we start by exploring optimal sets of patterns that allow us to reconstruct the image with the fewest measurements, or lowest sampling rate, possible. We then propose a DL neural network that can directly reconstruct images from GI measurements even when the sampling rate is extremely low. We demonstrate that our deep learning-based GI (DLGI) approach has potential in image reconstruction, with results comparable to direct imaging (DI) at the same dose. However, given the same prior knowledge and detector quantum efficiency, it is very challenging for DLGI to outperform DI under low-dose conditions. We discuss how it may be achievable due to the higher sensitivity of bucket detectors over pixel detectors.</description>

      <title>Experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning for external validation of predicting pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy from histological images in breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) provides a standard treatment option for patients who have locally advanced cancer and some large operable tumors. A patient will have better prognosis when he has achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) with the treatment of NAC. There has been a trend to directly predict pCR to NAC from histological images based on deep learning (DL). However, the DL-based predictive models numerically have better performances in internal validation than in external validation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this situation with an intrinsic approach. We propose an experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning (ECDEDL) approach. Taking the cognition of both pathology and artificial intelligence experts into consideration to improve the generalization of the predictive model to the external validation, ECDEDL can intrinsically approximate the working paradigm of a human being which will refer to his various working experiences to make decisions. ECDEDL was validated with 695 WSIs collected from the same center as the primary dataset to develop the predictive model and perform the internal validation, and was also validated with 340 WSIs collected from other three centers as the external dataset to perform the external validation. In external validation, ECDEDL improves the AUCs of pCR prediction from 61.52(59.80-63.26) to 67.75(66.74-68.80) and the Accuracies of pCR prediction from 56.09(49.39-62.79) to 71.01(69.44-72.58). ECDEDL was quite effective for external validation of predicting pCR to NAC from histological images in breast cancer, numerically approximating the internal validation.</description>
