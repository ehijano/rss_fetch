      <title>An algebra modality admitting countably many deriving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category, that is, a symmetric monoidal category enriched over commutative monoids, with an algebra modality, axiomatizing smooth functions, and a deriving transformation on this algebra modality, axiomatizing differentiation. Lemay proved that a comonoidal algebra modality has at most one deriving transformation, thus differentiation is unique in models of differential linear logic. It was then an open problem whether this result extends to arbitrary algebra modalities. We answer this question in the negative. We build a free "commutative rig with a self-map" algebra modality on the category of commutative monoids, where the self-map can be seen as an arbitrary smooth function. We then define a countable family of distinct deriving transformations $({}_{n}\mathsf{d})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this algebra modality where the parameter $n$ controls the derivative of the self-map. It shows that in a differential category, a single algebra modality may admit multiple, inequivalent notions of differentiation.</description>

      <title>An Enriched Approach to the Strictification of $(\infty,1)$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a functor which takes in an $(\infty,1)$-category and outputs an $(\omega,1)$-category, the natural maximally "strict" version of an $(\infty,1)$-category. We do this by modeling $(\infty,1)$-categories as categories enriched in $\infty$-groupoids, and then "locally strictifying" (applying the strictification of $\infty$-groupoids to each hom space) to obtain a category enriched in $\omega$-groupoids with respect to the Gray tensor product, followed by "globally strictifying" (strictifying the enrichment from the Gray tensor product to the cartesian product) to obtain a category cartesian-enriched in $\omega$-groupoids, which is equivalently an $(\omega,1)$-category. We conjecture that this functor is conservative, and prove this for two dual special cases: $2$-truncated and $2$-connected $(\infty,1)$-categories. Along the way, we construct a sort of "incoherent walking $(\omega,1)$-equivalence," which gives a simpler description of the coherent path lifting condition for fibrations of $(\omega,1)$-categories, only involving cells of dimension $\le 3$.</description>

      <title>One rig to control them all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of seven naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits. We prove that this syntactic construction semantically corresponds to taking the free rig category on the base prop.</description>

      <title>Representing the language of a topos as quotient of the category of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use quotients of span categories to introduce the language of a topos. We also study the logical relations and the quotients of span categories derived from them. As an application we show that the category of Boolean toposes is a reflective subcategory of the category of toposes, when the morphisms are logical functors.</description>

      <title>Important Classes of Morphisms and the Relative Cotangent Sequence in Tangent Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, their properties, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class appears in algebraic geometry, differential geometry, algebra, and in Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. In particular, we use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category.</description>

      <title>Wakamatsu tilting subcategories and weak support tau-tilting subcategories in recollements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that if (A, B, C) is a recollement of abelian categories, then Wakamatsu tilting (resp. weak support tau-tilting) subcategories in A and C can induce Wakamatsu tilting (resp. weak support tau-tilting) subcategories in B, and the converses hold under natural assumptions. As an application, we mainly consider the relationship of tau-cotorsion torsion triples in (A, B, C).</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>From Link Homology to Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey reviews recent advances connecting link homology theories to invariants of smooth 4-manifolds and extended topological quantum field theories. Starting from joint work with Morrison and Walker, I explain how functorial link homologies that satisfy additional invariance conditions become diagram-independent, give rise to braided monoidal 2-categories, extend naturally to links in the 3-sphere, and globalize to skein modules for 4-manifolds. Later developments show that these skein lasagna modules furnish invariants of embedded and immersed surfaces and admit computation via handle decompositions. I then survey structural properties, explicit computations, and applications to exotic phenomena in 4-manifold topology, and place link homology and skein lasagna modules within the framework of extended topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions on irreducible projective curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note revisits stability conditions on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on irreducible projective curves. In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide a reasonable full boundary, a notion of regular weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins--Lo--Shi--Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On non-rational singular curves, any locally-finite numerical stability condition is shown to be geometric.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a $d$-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical $d$-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>
