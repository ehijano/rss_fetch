      <title>Electron identification and hadron discrimination using Cherenkov radiation in air and SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to identify electrons using the Cherenkov light emitted when a charged particle travels in air and photons are detected with a Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM). The analysis is based on a photon-counting approach using SPAD cells and uses data collected during a test beam at CERN PS. The results are well described by a simple Monte Carlo simulation, which further demonstrates that a very good electron identification and a strong pion/hadron rejection could be obtained over a wide momentum range.</description>

      <title>Probes of lepton flavor symmetry and violation with top quarks in ATLAS and CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of lepton flavor universality (LFU) and searches for charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) are one of the most straightforward ways of searching for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. The numerous production of top quark pairs at the LHC allows for high precision measurements of LFU ratios and searches for cLFV signatures. Results of the recent measurements and searches from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using the Run2 dataset with an integrated luminosity of up to 139 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at center of mass energy of 13 TeV are presented.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Flavor physics at the EIC with b-jet tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ an approximate conserved quantum number (defined as "$b$-Parity" in [1]) of the Standard Model (SM): $b_P=(-1)^n$, where $n$ is the number of produced $b$-jets in the reaction $e + p/A \to n \cdot j_b +X$, to explore new TeV-scale flavor-changing interactions involving the 3rd generation quarks at the EIC; simply by counting the number of $b$-jets in the final state. In particular, the SM single and di-jet production at the EIC which occur through charge current interactions, $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ and $e + p/A \to 2\cdot j + \!\not\!E_T$, are $b_P$-even since the $b_P$-violating (i.e, $b_P=-1$) SM signals for these processes are necessarily CKM suppressed and, therefore, have a vanishingly small production rate. In contrast, new flavor physics can generate $b_P=-1$ signals at the EIC whose only significant SM background is due to $b$-jet misidentification. We thus show that $b_P$ can be used as a simple and sensitive probe of new flavor violating physics; specifically, we find that counting single $b$-jet events in $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ at the EIC with a center-of-mass (CM) energy of $\sqrt{s} \sim 140$ GeV, can probe scales of new physics up to $\Lambda \sim {\cal O}(5)$ TeV for a certain type of new chiral flavor-changing physics in 3rd generation interactions. This is remarkably more than 30 times larger than the assumed EIC CM energy and it critically depends on the $b$-tagging efficiency and purity as well as the feasibility of electron-beam polarization. The sensitivity of the di-jet process, $e + p/A \to 2j + \!\not\!E_T$, to these type of new physics is reduced compared to the single-jet channel.</description>

      <title>Upstream Laser-based Longitudinal Enhancement of Relativistic Photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal phase space of high-brightness relativistic electron beams is crucial for advancing a broad spectrum of charged-particle-based instrumentation and scientific frontiers. A generalized method for achieving this control involves manipulating the photoemission laser's temporal distribution at the picosecond level, a long-standing technical challenge. Recent developments in laser shaping have enabled the creation of high-power, picosecond-scale symmetrical and asymmetrical temporal profiles, capable of fine-tuning complex space-charge dynamics and external field effects in relativistic charged-particle beams. Here, we demonstrate that rather than deviations from theorized, idealized laser distributions, a controlled asymmetry can be harnessed to counteract accelerator-induced distortions. By implementing spatiotemporal shaping of the ultraviolet photocathode laser at the LCLS-II superconducting injector, we achieve deterministic control over the longitudinal phase space without downstream corrections. We find that this optical asymmetry induces a self-linearizing effect across both low (40 pC) and high (80 pC) charge regimes, effectively suppressing nonlinear compression and energy chirp. Consequently, this approach is expected to preserve a low emittance comparable to that of ideal flattop or regular Gaussian profiles, while delivering superior current uniformity and shot-to-shot stability. These results establish spatiotemporal laser shaping as a compact, generalizable tool for directly optimizing beam brightness at the source.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Topological quantization of vector meson anomalous couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new anomalous term in hidden local symmetry that enforces the topological quantization of vector-meson anomalous couplings. Unlike existing formulations in the literature, which introduce several unquantized coefficients, our term removes this freedom by fixing the couplings to quantized, topologically determined values. We further conjecture that it saturates the anomaly, explaining the success of vector-meson dominance while pinpointing where saturation must fail. High-precision measurements of $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma^*$ form factors at BESIII and the Super $\tau$-Charm Facility can provide a definitive experimental discriminator of this quantized picture.</description>

      <title>Beyond Form Factors: Precise Angular Tests in Hadronic $\tau$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semileptonic $\tau$ decays mainly proceed via interactions between charged lepton and quark currents. The hadronization of the quark current is intrinsically nonperturbative and generally cannot be addressed analytically. In these proceedings, we propose using symmetry arguments alone to construct clean angular observables, which, within the Standard Model and in the absence of long-distance electromagnetic corrections, remain form-factor independent. These predictions can be experimentally tested, and any observed deviation could signal either effects of physics beyond the Standard Model or provide a clean benchmark for long-distance electromagnetic corrections. We also perform a first estimate of the expected impact of new physics in an EFT framework.</description>

      <title>Light-Flavour Resonance Production in High-Energy Heavy-Ion Collisions: An Experimental Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances provide sensitivity to the late-stage dynamics of heavy-ion collisions, as their lifetimes are comparable to the duration of the hadronic phase. This review summarizes state-of-the-art measurements of light-flavour mesonic and baryonic resonances, including $\rho$(770), $K^{\star}$(892), $\phi$(1020), $\Delta$(1232), $\Lambda^{\star}$(1520), $\Sigma^{\star}$(1385) and $\Xi^\star$(1530), in pp, p-A and A-A collisions at SPS, RHIC and the LHC. Systematic trends in yields, mass and width modifications, transverse-momentum spectra, nuclear modification factors, and particle ratios reveal the interplay of re-scattering and regeneration, medium-induced suppression, and the development of collective dynamics with increasing system size and multiplicity. Anisotropic flow results confirm the coupling of resonances to the expanding medium, while recent vector-meson spin-alignment measurements offer fresh insights into hadronization mechanisms and local fields. Ultra-peripheral collisions provide vacuum-like baselines for isolating in-medium effects. Emerging opportunities for charm-resonance studies in upcoming high-luminosity experiments are also outlined.Together, these advances demonstrate the important role of resonance measurements in constraining the space-time evolution of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of $S$-wave quarkonium states within the BFKL formalism. We present the computation of the real-emission contributions which completes the recent one of one-loop virtual corrections by one of us for the impact factors for the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states. We prove the cancellation of soft divergences between real and virtual contributions, and that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Search for charged-lepton flavour violation in top quark interactions with an up-type quark, a muon, and a $\tau$ lepton in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for charged-lepton flavour violation (CLFV) in top quark (t) production and decay is presented. The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The signal consists of the production of a single top quark via a CLFV interaction or top quark pair production followed by a CLFV decay. The analysis selects events containing a hadronically decaying $\tau$ lepton and a muon of opposite electric charge, as well as at least three jets, one of which is identified as originating from the fragmentation of a bottom quark. Machine learning classification techniques are used to distinguish signal from standard model background events. The results of this search are consistent with the standard model expectations. The upper limits at 95% confidence level on the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}$ for CLFV top quark decays to a muon, a $\tau$ lepton, and an up or a charm quark are set at $\mathcal{B}$(t $\to$ $\mu\tau$u) $\lt$ (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, and $\mathcal{B}$(t $\to$ $\mu\tau$c) $\lt$ (0.81, 1.71, and 2.05) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ for scalar, vector, and tensor-like operators, respectively.</description>

      <title>Search for $CP$ violation in events with top quarks and Z bosons at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 and 13.6 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for the violation of the charge-parity ($CP$) symmetry in the production of top quarks in association with Z bosons is presented, using events with at least three charged leptons and additional jets. The search is performed in a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016$-$2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and in 2022 at 13.6 TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 173 fb$^{-1}$. For the first time in this final state, observables that are odd under the $CP$ transformation are employed. Also for the first time, physics-informed machine-learning techniques are used to construct these observables. While for standard model (SM) processes the distributions of these observables are predicted to be symmetric around zero, $CP$-violating modifications of the SM would introduce asymmetries. Two $CP$-odd operators $\mathcal{O}_\text{tW}^\text{I}$ and $\mathcal{O}_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$ in the SM effective field theory are considered that may modify the interactions between top quarks and electroweak bosons. The obtained results are consistent with the SM prediction within two standard deviations, and exclusion limits on the associated Wilson coefficients of $-$2.7 $\lt$ $c_\text{tW}^\text{I}$ $\lt$ 2.5 and $-$0.2 $\lt$ $c_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$ $\lt$ 2.0 are set at 95% confidence level. The largest discrepancy is observed in $c_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$ where data is consistent with positive values, with an observed local significance with respect to the SM hypothesis of 2.5 standard deviations, when only linear terms are considered.</description>

Abstract: Beam dump experiments represent an effective way to probe new physics in a parameter space, where new particles have feeble couplings to the Standard Model sector and masses below the GeV scale. The LUXE experiment, designed primarily to study strong-field quantum electrodynamics, can be used also as a photon beam dump experiment with a unique reach for new spin-0 particles in the $10-350~\mathrm{MeV}$ mass and $10^{-6}-10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ couplings to photons ranges. This is achieved via the ``New Physics search with Optical Dump'' (NPOD) concept. While prior estimations were obtained with a simplified model of the experimental setup, in this work we present a systematic study of the new physics reach in the full, realistic experimental apparatus, including an existing detector to be used in the LUXE NPOD context. We furthermore investigate updated scenarios of LUXE's experimental plan and confirm that our results are in agreement with the original estimations of a background-free operation.</description>

Abstract: A study of charm mixing and CP violation in $D^0\to K^\pm\pi^\mp\pi^\pm\pi^\mp$ decays is performed using data collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6$\text{fb}^{-1}$. The ratio of promptly produced $D^0\to K^+\pi^- \pi^+\pi^-$ to $D^0\to K^-\pi^+ \pi^-\pi^+$ decay rates is measured as a function of $D^0$ decay time, both inclusive over phase space and in bins of phase space. Taking external inputs for the $D^0 -\overline{D}^0$ mixing parameters $x$ and $y$ allows constraints to be obtained on the hadronic parameters of the charm decay. When combined with previous measurements from charm-threshold experiments and at LHCb, improved knowledge is obtained for these parameters, which is valuable for studies of the angle $\gamma$ of the Unitarity Triangle. An alternative analysis is also performed, in which external inputs are taken for the hadronic parameters, and the mixing parameters are determined, including $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$, which are nonzero in the presence of CP violation. It is found that $x=\left(0.85^{+0.15}_{-0.24}\right)\%$, $y=\left( 0.21^{+0.29}{-0.27} \right)\%$, $\Delta x=\left( -0.02\pm {0.04} \right)\% $ and $\Delta y=\left( 0.02^{+0.04}_{-0.03} \right)\%$. These results are consistent with previous measurements and the hypothesis of CP conservation.</description>

      <title>First results of the NEXT-100 detector using $^{83m}$Kr decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report here the first results obtained with NEXT-100 using low-energy calibration data from $^{83m}$Kr decays, which allow mapping of the detector response in the active volume and monitoring of its stability over time. After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{\beta\beta}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.</description>

      <title>GPU-based track-finding for the J-PARC muon g-2/EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The muon \textit{g-2}/EDM experiment at J-PARC is designed to precisely measure the muon's magnetic moment and electric dipole moment, driven by discrepancies between theory and previous experiments. A key challenge is the fast reconstruction of positron tracks from multiple muon decays within a short time span causing an event pileup. One of the aspects is the identification of individual positron tracks from the reconstructed hits, which is currently done using a hough-transform based approach. Results from simulation studies have shown expected results in terms of efficiency and accuracy of track reconstruction. However, the execution time for the entire analysis chain is prohibitively long to be deployed in the experiment. Specifically, preliminary estimations suggest a requirement of 40 $\times$ speedup of the track-finding routine. In this context, we explore a GPU-based solution to accelerate track-finding through parallel processing and present the implementation details and the results of our study for different pileup conditions. The results indicate that the GPU solution far exceeds our expectation in terms of execution speed without compromising on the reconstruction efficiency.</description>

      <title>Constraints on lepton flavor universal and non-universal New Physics in $b\, \to\, s\, \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays: a global SMEFT survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flavor-changing neutral current semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons provide an excellent platform for indirectly probing New Physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM). Recent measurements of lepton flavor universality (LFU) ratios such as $R_K$, $R_{K^*}$, and $R_\phi$ are consistent with SM predictions, thereby reducing earlier hints of LFU violation. Nevertheless, notable tensions persist in individual branching fractions -- for instance $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ e^+ e^-)$, which deviate at the $4\sigma$--$5\sigma$ level in the low-$q^2$ region ($[1.1,6]$ GeV$^2$). Similarly, the angular observable $P'_5$ in $B \to K^{*} \mu^+ \mu^-$ shows a $3.3\sigma$ deviation, while $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-)$ departs from the SM by $3.6\sigma$. Although such discrepancies could in principle originate from underestimated hadronic effects, they may also indicate possible NP contributions. In this work, we perform a global fit to the latest $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data within the framework of dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Our analysis systematically incorporates hadronic uncertainties from form factors, non-factorizable corrections, and input parameters, thereby providing a balanced assessment of the NP interpretation. We allow for NP contributions not only in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions but also in $b \to s e^+ e^-$ channels, thus testing both lepton flavor universal (LFU) and lepton flavor universality violating (LFUV) NP scenarios. The interplay between these possibilities yields distinctive signatures in branching fractions, angular observables, and $\Delta$-observables, offering a comprehensive view of the current flavor anomalies.</description>

      <title>Dark monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwell's equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the extraordinary photon and the monopole belong to the dark sector, and the ordinary photon and the electron to the non-dark sector. A mixing interaction transforms both electron and monopole into dyons generating experimental consequences for indirect and direct monopole detection which we analyze.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Boson Decays: Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, new developments for the Standard Model Higgs-boson decays will be summarized. This addresses extensions of the grids used by {\tt Hdecay} to implement finite NLO mass effects for $H\to gg$ as well as explicit numbers for the branching fraction for the strange-Yukawa induced part of $H\to s\bar s$ together with the related uncertainties. In addition, first results of the strong and weak Dalitz decays of the Higgs-boson decays $H\to s\bar s + g/\gamma$ are presented. The Dalitz decays define the separation between the Yukawa-induced part and the continuum, that is not induced by the strange-Yukawa coupling, and thus pave the way towards a solid determination of the strange-Yukawa coupling at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, but will also be relevant for solid bounds on the strange-Yukawa coupling at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Design and Expected Performance for an hKLM at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent timing resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine learning has been integrated into the detector design process from the ground up. Detector design objectives are defined using Machine Learning based reconstruction and Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design. The highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for much more expensive detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system and a neutron hadron calorimeter. In EIC kinematics, charged particles are best measured through tracking rather than calorimetry, but the hKLM can identify and measure the momentum of neutral hadrons. The latter are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time of flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than that demonstrated for similar calorimeters read out with less granularity.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hadronic Matter on Parton Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.</description>
