      <title>Quantum-inspired space-time PDE solver and dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to the understanding of dynamical systems. Standard approaches involving time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective and interpretable models, bridging the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>A DSMC-PIC coupling method for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for the simulation of collisional plasma dynamics, based on a coupling between Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system. The approach extends previously developed DSMC techniques for the homogeneous Landau equation to the fully inhomogeneous, electromagnetic regime. The Landau collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Modeling of High-Density Carbon Nanotube Films for Memristive Device Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices. Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood. To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role. These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Using "AI Poincare" to analyze non-linear integrable optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study dives into the applicability of using automated discovery of conserved quantities in dynamical systems relevant to accelerator physics. Specifically, we explore the performance of AI Poincar\'e in analyzing numerical trajectory data obtained using the McMillan system of non-linear integrable optics. A comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance is conducted through diverse methodologies. These include the analysis of the estimated number of conserved quantities embedded in a dataset and the deviation of interpolated points on the inferred manifold with respect to points in actually in the dataset. the investigation identifies an optimal range of perturbation distances where the underlying manifold extraction algorithm inside AI Poincar\'e exhibits optimal performance. Additionally, an improved neural network architecture is proposed based on the observed results. Finally, we apply the algorithm to preliminary experimental data from the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab to successfully infer the number of conserved quantities even in the presence of fast decoherence of the measured signal.</description>

      <title>Fast integration method for averaging polydisperse bubble population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble-averaged polydisperse bubbly flow models require statistical moments of the evolving bubble size distribution. Under step forcing, these moments reach statistical equilibrium in finite time. However, the transitional phase before equilibrium and cases with time-dependent forcing are required to predict flow in engineering applications. Computing these moments is expensive because the integrands are highly oscillatory, even when the bubble dynamics are linear. Ensemble-averaged models compute these moments at each grid point and time step, making cost reduction important for large-scale bubbly flow simulations. Traditional methods evaluate the integrals via traditional quadrature rules. This approach requires a large number of quadrature nodes in the equilibrium bubble size, each equipped with its own advection partial differential equation (PDE), resulting in significant computational expense. We formulate a Levin collocation method to reduce this cost. Given the differential equation associated with the integrand, or moment, the method approximates it by evaluating its derivative via polynomial collocation. The differential matrix and amplitude function are well-suited to numerical differentiation via collocation, and so the computation is comparatively cheap. For an example excited polydisperse bubble population, the first moment is computed with the presented method at $10^{-3}$ relative error with 100 times fewer quadrature nodes than the trapezoidal rule. The gap increases for smaller target relative errors: the Levin method requires $10^4$ times fewer points for a relative error of $10^{-8}$. The formulated method maintains constant cost as the integrands become more oscillatory with time, making it particularly attractive for long-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic mesh adaptation for unsteady two-phase flow simulation with the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure based on Riemannian metrics for the simulation of two-phase incompressible flows with non-matching densities. The system dynamics are governed by the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, discretized with mixed finite elements and implicit time-stepping. Spatial accuracy is controlled throughout the simulation by the \emph{global transient fixed-point method} from Alauzet \emph{et al.}, in which the simulation time is divided into sub-intervals, each associated with an adapted anisotropic mesh. The simulation is run in a fixed-point loop until convergence of each mesh--solution pair. Each iteration takes advantage of the previously computed solution and accurately predicts the flow variations. This ensures that the mesh always captures the fluid-fluid interface, and allows for a dynamic control of the interface thickness at a fraction of the computational cost compared to uniform or isotropic grids. Moreover, using a modest number of time sub-intervals reduces the transfer error from one mesh to another, which would otherwise eventually spoil the numerical solution. The overall adaptive procedure is verified with manufactured solutions and the well-known rising bubble benchmark.</description>

      <title>Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) The same findings persist in MFGL models where an $m^6$ replaces the $m^4$ term and come with simple one-period integral criteria to locate $P_c$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the recently reported magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys. The Cr sublattice is alloyed with different amounts of Co in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) B2 AlCr binary alloy and the resulting exchange interactions are analyzed within the Heisenberg Hamiltonian framework. DFT results reveal that at low Co concentrations the system favors the AFM order, while at high Co contents a transition to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is observed. Within the FM stability field, the Curie temperature (TC), obtained within the mean-field approximation, is below ~160 K and decreases with Co concentration. The calculated exchange parameters evolve systematically with Co content, and the trends are consistent with the DFT total energies. The magnetic configurations obtained from MC simulations follow the DFT results at low Cr levels but predict a spin-glass behavior for alloys containing more than 40 at.% Co on Cr sublattice. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the chemistry-driven changes in exchange interactions affect magnetism in the B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys.</description>

      <title>FeaGPT: an End-to-End agentic-AI for Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are establishing new paradigms for engineering applications by enabling natural language control of complex computational workflows. This paper introduces FeaGPT, the first framework to achieve complete geometry-mesh-simulation workflows through conversational interfaces. Unlike existing tools that automate individual FEA components, FeaGPT implements a fully integrated Geometry-Mesh-Simulation-Analysis (GMSA) pipeline that transforms engineering specifications into validated computational results without manual intervention. The system interprets engineering intent, automatically generates physics-aware adaptive meshes, configures complete FEA simulations with proper boundary condition inference, and performs multi-objective analysis through closed-loop iteration.
  Experimental validation confirms complete end-to-end automation capability. Industrial turbocharger cases (7-blade compressor and 12-blade turbine at \SI{110000}{rpm}) demonstrate the system successfully transforms natural language specifications into validated CalculiX simulations, producing physically realistic results for rotating machinery analysis. Additional validation through 432 NACA airfoil configurations confirms scalability for parametric design exploration. These results demonstrate that natural language interfaces can effectively democratize access to advanced computational engineering tools while preserving analytical rigor.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of phase stability and magnetic properties of B2 AlCr, AlMn, AlFe, AlCo and AlNi aluminides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the electronic structure, phase stability, and magnetic properties of equiatomic binary alloys between Al and 3d magnetic transition elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Thermodynamically, all five binary aluminides are more stable in the ordered B2 phase than in the disordered body centered cubic phase, and Co is found to be the strongest B2 forming element with Al. The AlCo and AlNi compounds with B2 structure are verified to be non-magnetic, whereas AlFe turns out to be weakly magnetic, which is consistent with other DFT calculations employing similar exchange-correlation approximations. Magnetic simulations based on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the hypothetical B2 AlCr, which is also confirmed by direct DFT calculations. Doping AlCr with Co leads to an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition, where ferromagnetism is to a large extent attributed to Cr atoms. The phase stability and magnetic trends are explained using electronic structure arguments. The present findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase stability and magnetic properties of AlX binary alloys, providing insights into the formation mechanisms of the B2 structure with 3d magnetic transition metals.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Rotor Cooling with Ducted Liquid in Completely Cold-Formed Modular Motor Shaft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper suggests a novel rotor-cooling shaft concept for high-performance electric motors that increases the effectiveness of cooling and is yet simple and cost-effective to manufacture. We investigate the thermal performance of four shaft geometries for rotor cooling in automotive applications. The proposed tooth-guided liquid-cooling shaft design aims to solve the high churning loss of conventional cooled rotor shafts due to internal vortex formation and their still limited heat transfer. Therefore, we optimize heat transfer efficiency and pressure management by incorporating cold-formed internal channels that restrict vortex formation beyond a degree that improves heat transfer. We evaluated key performance metrics, including heat transfer rate, outlet temperature, pressure drop, and velocity profiles, under varying rotational speeds, inlet flow rates, and coolant temperatures. Computational fluid analysis demonstrates that the tooth-guided design outperforms conventional hollow shafts and achieves up to 110% higher cooling efficiency at low rotational speeds, while it maintains comparable pressure levels. These findings provide practical insight into geometry-driven thermal optimization and offer a path toward improving the performance and durability of electric motors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a method for significantly lowering the viscosity achievable for a hydrodynamic lattice gas method. The key advance is the derivation of a mirror state that allows for a reduction of viscosity by more than an order of magnitude over existing lattice gas methods.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning and Reduced-Order Modeling of Navier-Stokes Equations in Complex Porous Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the complex microstructure of a porous material. Discretizing the equations on a fine grid using a staggered (e.g., marker-and-cell, mixed FEM) scheme results in a nonlinear residual. Adopting the Newton method, a linear system must be solved at each iteration, which is large, ill-conditioned, and has a saddle-point structure. This demands an iterative (e.g., Krylov) solver, that requires preconditioning to ensure rapid convergence. We propose two monolithic \textit{algebraic} preconditioners, $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{NS}}$, that are generalizations of previously proposed forms by the authors for the Stokes equations ($a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{S}}$). The former is based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and the latter on the pore network model (PNM), both successful approximate solvers. We also formulate faster-converging geometric preconditioners $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ and $g\mathrm{PNM}$, which impose $\partial_n\boldsymbol{u}\!=\!0$ (zero normal-gradient of velocity) exactly at subdomain interfaces. Finally, we propose an accurate coarse-scale solver for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations based on $g\mathrm{PLMM}$, capable of computing approximate solutions orders of magnitude faster. We benchmark our preconditioners against state-of-the-art block preconditioners and show $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ is the best-performing one, followed closely by $a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ for steady-state flow and $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ for transient flow. All preconditioners can be built and applied on parallel machines.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Inverse Design for Photonics via Integrated Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjoint-based inverse design yields compact, high-performance nanophotonic devices, but the mapping from pixel-level layouts to optical figures of merit remains hard to interpret. We present a simple pipeline that (i) generates a large set of wavelength demultiplexers (WDMs) with SPINS-B, (ii) records each final 2D layout and its spectral metrics (e.g., transmitted power at 1310 nm and 1550 nm), and (iii) trains a lightweight convolutional surrogate to predict these metrics from layouts, enabling (iv) gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients (IG) to highlight specific regions most responsible for performance. On a corpus of sampled WDMs, IG saliency consistently localizes to physically meaningful features (e.g., tapers and splitter hubs), offering design intuition that complements adjoint optimization. Our contribution is an end-to-end, data-driven workflow--SPINS-B dataset, CNN surrogate, and IG analysis--that turns inverse-designed layouts into interpretable attributions without modifying the physics solver or objective, and that can be reused for other photonic components.</description>

      <title>Aeroelastic Reduced-Order Model Differential Equations in Transonic Buffeting Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the transonic shock buffet phenomenon remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent nonlinear and unsteady characteristics. These difficulties are further compounded in three-dimensional configurations and when aeroelastic coupling is considered. Consequently, computational studies of aeroelastic shock buffet interactions have largely been confined to two-dimensional systems. This limitation underscores the need for reduced-order models (ROMs) capable of efficiently and accurately capturing the aeroelastic response of structures subjected to shock buffet oscillations. This paper presents a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM that integrates nonlinear oscillator dynamics with Volterra theory to model aeroelastic shock buffet phenomena. The coefficients and terms of the resulting Integro-Differential Equation ROM (IDE-ROM) are identified using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Application of the IDE-ROM to an OAT15A airfoil demonstrates that the compact and computationally efficient formulation can reproduce key nonlinear behaviors, including aeroelastic lock-in, with a high degree of accuracy. The limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach are also critically examined.</description>

      <title>HPC-Driven Modeling with ML-Based Surrogates for Magnon-Photon Dynamics in Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating hybrid magnonic quantum systems remains a challenge due to the large disparity between the timescales of the two systems. We present a massively parallel GPU-based simulation framework that enables fully coupled, large-scale modeling of on-chip magnon-photon circuits. Our approach resolves the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic and electromagnetic fields with high spatiotemporal fidelity. To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Surface layers and linearized water waves: a boundary integral equation framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of surface waves traveling along the boundary of a liquid medium are changed by the presence of floating plates and membranes, contributing to a number of important phenomena in a wide range of applications. Mathematically, if the fluid is only partly covered by a plate or membrane, the order of derivatives of the surface-boundary conditions jump between regions of the surface. In this work, we consider a general class of problems for infinite depth linearized surface waves in which the plate or membrane has a compact hole or multiple holes. For this class of problems, we describe a general integral equation approach, and for two important examples, the partial membrane and the polynya, we analyze the resulting boundary integral equations. In particular, we show that they are Fredholm second kind and discuss key properties of their solutions. We develop flexible and fast algorithms for discretizing and solving these equations, and demonstrate their robustness and scalability in resolving surface wave phenomena through several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A special 2D initial conditions' domain of the equal-mass zero angular momentum planar three-body problem, which has been formerly studied, is analyzed to deepen the knowledge of the stability regions in it. The decay times in the domain are carefully computed. Four stability regions are established. 971 verified initial conditions for linearly stable periodic collisionless orbits are found. Many of these identified initial conditions are new ones. The periodic orbits of each stability region are characterized by a certain pattern in their syzygy sequences. Additional computations show that the orbits found should be considered as candidates for KAM-stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Motivated by mixed-anion electrolyte decomposition products, we combine diffusion-based generative structure prediction with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to interrogate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and, through MLIP-accelerated molecular dynamics, show that the amorphous counterpart is more conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma$ $\approx$ 0.18 mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a}$ $\approx$ 0.40 eV. This enhancement is attributed to structural disorder, which flattens the Li site-energy landscape, and to a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We present mixed-anion, amorphous Li--P--O--F phases as promising candidates for the \ce{Li+}-conducting medium of the inorganic SEI, offering a path forward for engineering improved battery interfaces.</description>

      <title>LightPFP: A Lightweight Route to Ab Initio Accuracy at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.</description>

      <title>Common Task Framework For a Critical Evaluation of Scientific Machine Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming modeling and control in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. However, rapid development has outpaced the creation of standardized, objective benchmarks - leading to weak baselines, reporting bias, and inconsistent evaluations across methods. This undermines reproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific progress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for scientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data. Inspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for head-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark methods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz. These results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse objectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea surface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community engagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.</description>

      <title>Accelerating IC Thermal Simulation Data Generation via Block Krylov and Operator Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs), have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits comparable performance to that using the existing method.</description>

      <title>Automated Exploration of Radical-Molecule Chemistry: The Case of Oxirane + CH in the ISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>The First Star-by-star $N$-body/Hydrodynamics Simulation of Our Galaxy Coupling with a Surrogate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.</description>

      <title>Elastic modeling and total energy calculations of the structural characteristics of "free-standing",periodic, pseudomorphic GaN/AlN superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strain states of the components of pseudomorphic superlattices can be accurately modeled analytically through the application of linear elasticity. In this particular case of GaN/AlN 'free-standing' superlattices, the predictions derived from elastic modeling have been compared with total energy calculations of several systems made of components with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts, within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the interfaces present in these systems. The results mentioned above are briefly contrasted with findings reported in previous literature.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Variational Inference Framework for Identifying Attributions of Extreme Stress Events in Low-Grain Polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycrystalline metal failure often begins with stress concentration at grain boundaries. Identifying which microstructural features trigger these events is important but challenging because these extreme damage events are rare and the failure mechanisms involve multiple complex processes across scales. Most existing inference methods focus on average behavior rather than rare events, whereas standard sample-based methods are computationally expensive for high-dimensional complex systems. In this paper, we develop a new variational inference framework that integrates a recently developed computationally efficient physics-informed statistical model with extreme value statistics to significantly facilitate the identification of material failure attributions. First, we reformulate the objective to emphasize observed exceedances by incorporating extreme-value theory into the likelihood, thereby highlighting tail behavior. Second, we constrain inference via a physics-informed statistical model that characterizes microstructure-stress relationships, which uniquely provides physically consistent predictions for these rare events. Third, mixture models in a reduced latent space are developed to capture the non-Gaussian characteristics of microstructural features, allowing the identification of multiple underlying mechanisms. In both controlled and realistic experimental tests for the bicrystal configuration, the framework achieves reliable extreme-event prediction and reveals the microstructural features associated with material failure, providing physical insights for material design with uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Towards Deep Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in settings where the others diverge.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-Fermi liquid physics of one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</description>

      <title>Transferability and interpretability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of vibrational coordinates is crucial for the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of molecular vibrational dynamics and spectra calculations. We explore the recently proposed normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates, which are learned molecule-specific coordinate transformations optimized for a given basis set. Much like how spherical coordinates naturally simplify the hydrogen atom by embedding physical insight into the coordinate system, normalizing-flow coordinates offload complexity from the basis functions into the coordinate transformation itself. This shift not only improves basis-set convergence, but also enhances interpretability of vibrational motions. We provide an analysis of the utility, interpretation and associated constraints of normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates. Moreover, we demonstrate that these coordinates can be generalized across different isotopologues, and even structurally related molecules, achieved with minimal fine-tuning of selected output parameters.</description>

      <title>Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a step in the direction of developing integer lattice gas methods as an attractive alternative to lattice Boltzmann methods. Here we show that to Boltzmann limit the one dimensional Blommel integer lattice gas is very close to entropic lattice Boltzmann. More interestingly the integer lattice gas retains additional correlations that prevent the existence of a well defined Boltzmann limit. In the analysis of the decaying sine wave we will see that in some situations the bulk viscosity can crucially depend on such correlations beyond the Boltzmann limit. A sampling collision operator, introduced here, can speed up the execution time to make the algorithm obtain comparable computational efficiency to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Coarse-Graining in Molecular Dynamics: A Flow-Based Framework without Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models provide an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations (MD), but conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom MD trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data dependence limits accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG models. We introduce a fully data-free, generative framework for CG that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. The model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, represented through simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A learnable, bijective map from latent space to atomistic coordinates enables the automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. Training relies solely on the interatomic potential and minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via an energy-based objective. To stabilize optimization and ensure mode coverage, we employ an adaptive tempering scheme that promotes the exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate independent, one-shot equilibrium samples at full atomic resolution. Validation on two synthetic systems, a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture model, as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide, demonstrates that the method captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, reconstructs atomic configurations, and automatically learns physically meaningful CG representations. These results suggest a promising, data-free alternative to traditional CG techniques, offering both a principled approach to addressing the long-standing "chicken-and-egg" challenge in coarse-graining and an effective solution to the back-mapping problem by enabling accurate reconstruction of all-atom configurations.</description>

      <title>Beyond surfaces: quantifying internal radiative heat transport in dense materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of forward-mode algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</description>
