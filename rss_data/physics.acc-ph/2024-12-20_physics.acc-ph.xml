      <title>Performance envelope of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield accelerator experiments have made enormous progress over the past $\sim 20$ years, but their promise to revolutionize high-energy particle sources is only beginning to be realized. To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from $&gt;50$ published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 \si{\micro\meter}, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a $\gtrsim 30$ PW laser operating at electron density $&lt;10^{17}/$cm$^3$.</description>

      <title>Generation and Acceleration of Isolated-Attosecond Electron Bunch in a Hollow-Channel Plasma Wakefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating and accelerating simultaneously a dozen-GeV isolated attosecond electron bunch from an electron beam-driven hollow-channel plasma target. During the beam-target interaction, transverse oscillations of plasma electrons are induced, and subsequently, a radiative wakefield is generated. Meanwhile, a large number of plasma electrons of close to the speed of light are injected transversely from the position of the weaker radiative wakefield (e.g., the half-periodic node of the radiative wakefield) and converge towards the center of the hollow channel, forming an isolated attosecond electron bunch. Then, the attosecond electron bunch is significantly accelerated to high energies by the radiative wakefield. It is demonstrated theoretically and numerically that this scheme can efficiently generate an isolated attosecond electron bunch with a charge of more than 2 nC, a peak energy up to 13 GeV of more than 2 times that of the driving electron beam, a peak divergence angle of less than 5 mmrad, a duration of 276 as, and an energy conversion efficiency of 36.7% as well as a high stability as compared with the laser-beam drive case. Such an isolated attosecond electron bunch in the range of GeV would provide critical applications in ultrafast physics and high energy physics, etc.</description>

      <title>Study of NbN as superconducting material for the usage in superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new axion-haloscope is setup at the Johannes Gutenberg university of Mainz, named the Supax (a SUPerconducting AXion search) experiment. This setup is used to characterize the behaviour of a NbN coated superconducting cavity in a 2.5T strong magnetic field, at a resonance frequency of 8.4GHz. We observe an increasing surface resistance with increasing magnetic field, leading to a decreasing quality factor. The behaviour is similar to that of previously studied cavities using Nb3Tn.</description>
