      <title>The Future of Work: Inequality, Artificial Intelligence, and What Can Be Done About It. A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence constitutes a new wave of automation. There is broad agreement among economists that humanity is potentially entering into a period of profound change. However, significant uncertainties and disagreements exist concerning a variety of overlapping topics: the share of jobs in which human labour is displaced and/or reinstated through automation; the effects on income inequality; the effects on job satisfaction; and, finally, what policy changes ought to be pursued to reduce potential negative impacts. This literature review seeks to clarify this landscape by mapping out key disagreements between positions, and to identify the critical elements upon which such disagreements rest. By surveying the current literature, the effects of AI on the future of work will be clarified.</description>

      <title>Import competition and domestic vertical integration: Theory and Evidence from Chinese firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What impact does import competition have on firms' production organizational choices? Existing literature has predominantly focused on the relationship between import competition and firms' global production networks, with less attention given to domestic. We first develop a Nash-bargaining model to guide our empirical analysis, then utilize tariff changes as an exogenous shock to test our theoretical hypotheses using a database of Chinese listed firms from 2000 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a decrease in downstream tariffs lead to an increase in vertical integration. In our mechanism tests, we discover that a reduction in upstream tariffs also enhances this effect. Moreover, the impact of tariff reductions on vertical integration is primarily observed in industries with high asset specificity, indicating that asset-specificity is a crucial mechanism. We further explore whether import competition encourages vertical integration for technological acquisition purpose, the effect is found only among high-tech firms, while it's absent in non-high-tech firms. Our research provides new perspectives and evidence on how firms optimize their production organization in the process of globalization.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between ESG rating disagreement and total factor productivity (TFP) based on data from Chinese domestic ESG rating agencies and financial data of A-share listed companies in China from 2015 to 2022. On one hand, the empirical results show that ESG rating disagreement reduces corporate TFP, a conclusion that is validated through multiple robustness tests. The mechanism analysis reveals an interaction effect between green innovation and ESG rating disagreement. Specifically, in firms without ESG rating disagreement, green innovation promotes the improvement of TFP; however, in firms with disagreement, although ESG rating disagreement may drive green innovation, this does not lead to an increase in TFP. Furthermore, ESG rating disagreement lower corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that this effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned, asset-intensive, and low-pollution enterprises. On the other hand, XGBoost regression demonstrates that ESG rating disagreement play a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP values showing that the main effects are more evident in firms with larger ESG rating disagreement.</description>

      <title>From catch-up to frontier: The utility model as a learning device to escape the middle-income trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escaping the middle-income trap requires a country to develop indigenous technological capabilities for high value-added innovation. This study examines the role of second-tier patent systems, known as utility models (UMs), in promoting such capability acquisition in less developed countries. UMs are designed to incentivize incremental and adaptive innovation through lower novelty standards than patents, but their long-term impact on the capability acquisition process remains underexplored. Using South Korea as a case study and drawing on the characteristics of technological regimes in catching-up economies, we present three key findings: First, the country's post-catch-up frontier technologies (U.S. patents) are more impactful (highly cited) when they build on Korean domestic UMs. This suggests that UM-based imitative and adaptive learning laid the foundation for the country's globally competitive capabilities. Second, the impact of UM-based learning diminishes as the country's economy develops. Third, frontier technologies rooted in UMs contribute more to the country's own specialization than to follow-on innovations by foreign actors, compared to technologies without UM linkages. We discuss how technological regimes and industrial policies in catching-up economies interact with the UM system to bridge the catching-up (imitation- and adaptation-based) and post-catching-up (specialization- and creativity-based) phases.</description>

      <title>Insuring Long-Term Care in Developing Countries: The Interaction between Formal and Informal Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does public insurance reduce uninsured long-term care (LTC) risks in developing countries, where informal insurance predominates? This paper exploits the rollout of LTC insurance in China around 2016 to examine the impact of public LTC insurance on healthy workers' labor supply, a critical self-insurance channel. We find that workers eligible for public LTC insurance were less likely to engage in labor work and worked fewer weeks annually following the policy change, suggesting a mitigation of uninsured risks. However, these impacts were insignificant among those with strong informal insurance coverage. Parallel changes in anticipated formal care use corroborate these findings. While our results reveal that public LTC insurance provides limited additional risk-sharing when informal insurance predominates, they also underscore its growing importance.</description>

      <title>The Climate Cost of Climate Investment: A Two-Period Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-size-fits-all paradigm that only adapts the scale and immediate outcome of climate investment to economic circumstances will provide a short-lived, economically inadequate response to climate issues; given the limited resources allocated to green finance, it stands to reason that the shortcomings of this will be exacerbated by the fact that it comes at the cost of long-term, self-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not consider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively dis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive advantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the greatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact of climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a state of flux - honouring similar financial commitments to vulnerable or highly developed peers, but unable to generate comparable return, yet sufficiently insulated from the impact of extreme climate phenomena to not organically develop solutions.
  In the face of these changing realities, green innovation needs to expand beyond technology and address systemic inefficiencies - lack of clear responsibility, ambiguously defined commitments, and inadequate checks &amp; balances to name a few.
  Clever application of financial engineering demonstrates promise, and simple measures like carbon-credit exchanges have been effective in mitigating imperfections at the grassroots level. We believe that information- and incentive-centric systemic advancements can usher a fresh wave of green innovation that stands on the shoulders of giants to ensure effective implementation of technological breakthroughs; economic development that will create an international community equipped with a robust framework to deal with long-term crises in a strategic manner.</description>

      <title>DeepVoting: Learning Voting Rules with Tailored Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregating the preferences of multiple agents into a collective decision is a common step in many important problems across areas of computer science including information retrieval, reinforcement learning, and recommender systems. As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing algorithms for aggregation rules with specific properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, the prior work in this area has required extremely large models, or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing a good voting rule into one of learning probabilistic versions of voting rules that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions from the literature. We show that embeddings of preference profiles derived from the social choice literature allows us to learn existing voting rules more efficiently and scale to larger populations of voters more easily than other work if the embedding is tailored to the learning objective. Moreover, we show that rules learned using embeddings can be tweaked to create novel voting rules with improved axiomatic properties. Namely, we show that existing voting rules require only minor modification to combat a probabilistic version of the No Show Paradox.</description>

      <title>Climate, Crops, and Postharvest Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present new evidence of the effects of climate shocks on conflict. Focusing on political violence in Africa, I find that El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shocks during the crop-growing season affect harvest-related conflict in croplands exposed to this climate phenomenon. Specifically, a 1{\deg}C warming of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a proxy for a moderate-strength El Ni\~no event, reduces political violence in exposed locations with crop agriculture, relative to other areas, by approximately three percent, during the early postharvest season. This effect attenuates toward zero as the crop year progresses. This effect can be five times as large after a strong El Ni\~no event, such as that of 1997 or 2015, in highly exposed croplands, such as parts of Southern Africa and the Sahel. Conversely, a La Ni\~na event, which is a counterpart of an El Ni\~no event, has the opposite effect and thus increases conflict in the exposed croplands during the early postharvest season. Because ENSO events can be predicted at least several months in advance, these findings can contribute to creating a platform for early warnings of changes in political violence in predominantly agrarian societies.</description>

      <title>The Gerber-Shiu Expected Discounted Penalty Function: An Application to Poverty Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>

      <title>From Friendship Networks to Classroom Dynamics: Leveraging Neural Networks, Instrumental Variable and Genetic Algorithms for Optimal Educational Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses data from the China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS) to design a classroom assignment policy that maximizes peer effects. Our approach comprises three steps: firstly, we develop a friendship formation discrete choice model and estimate it with an interpretable neural network architecture, PeerNN, generating an adjacency-probability matrix $\Omega$ that reflects friendship formation probabilities. Secondly, we incorporate $\Omega$ into a linear-in-means model to estimate peer effects. The peer effect parameter, $\beta$, has a different interpretation from the conventional linear-in-means model and opens up a strategic scope of mean-maximizing classroom assignment policy. By exploiting the conditional random classroom assignment in many Chinese middle schools, we construct a valid instrument to address the endogeneity issue induced by $\Omega$ and consistently estimate $\beta$. Lastly, utilizing the estimates of $\Omega$ and $\beta$, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the mean-maximizing class assignment policy. Though the result is much more efficient (i.e. more positive average peer effect) than random classroom assignment (i.e. the current practice in most Chinese middle schools), GA policy is highly inequitable: a small number of students are predicted to experience severely negative peer effects. To balance students' academic performance with educational equity, we propose a fairness metric and penalize classroom assignment that generates large variances in peer effects. The modified method is called algorithmically fair genetic algorithm (AFGA). AFGA policy is less efficient but much more equitable. We allow user-defined parameters for AFGA such that the school principals can adjust the trade-off between efficiency and equity according to their preferences.</description>

      <title>The Impossible Trinity of Human Space Usage between Home, Workplace and Amenity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an impossible trinity of human space usage between home, workplace, and amenity in this paper to explain mobility pattern changes and shifts in demand for space during COVID-19. We developed detailed time usage and location visit profiles for 60,131 people in England and Wales by analyzing about 120 million cell phone location and timestamp records on March 2020 and March 2021. We found that both at-home time and amenity visits increased during COVID-19, while workplace visits decreased. Individual visits to different locations are determined by three key factors: individual preference measured by pre-pandemic location visit frequency, time constraints influenced by work-from-home, and space accessibility. We also find that WFH improves equality of individual amenity usage between people of different incomes. Low-income and middle-income people saw an 8% and 4% increase in additional amenity visits, respectively, compared to high-income people during the pandemic.</description>
