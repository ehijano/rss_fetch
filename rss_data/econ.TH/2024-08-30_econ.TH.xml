      <title>The nonlinear economy (I): How resource constrains lead to business cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the nonlinear dynamics of a macroeconomic model with resource constraints. The dynamics is derived from a production function that considers capital and a generalized form of energy as inputs. Energy, the new variable, is depleted during the production process and has to be renewed, whereas capital grows with production and decreases from depreciation. Dependent on time scales and energy related control parameters, we obtain steady states of high or low production, but also sustained oscillations that show properties of business cycles. We also find conditions for the coexistence of stable fixed points and limit cycles. Our model allows to specify investment and saving functions for Kaldor's model of business cycles. We provide evidence for an endogenous origin of business cycles if depleting resources are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Harmful choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the choice behavior of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing some distortion of her true preference, in which the first $i$ alternatives are moved to the bottom, in a reversed order. The deterministic declination of our pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM in her decision. We analyze irrational choices that display the lowest degree of self-punishment, and a characterization of them is provided. Moreover, we characterize the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that it comprises almost all choices. We also characterize stochastic self-punishment, which collects all the Random Utility Models (RUMs) whose support is restricted to the harmful distortions of some preference. Full identification of the DM's preference and randomization over its harmful distortions is allowed if each alternative is selected from the ground set with probability greater than zero. Finally, the degree of self-punishment of harmful stochastic choices is characterized.</description>

      <title>Institutions of public judgment established by social contract and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a plausible mechanism for sustaining cooperation: people cooperate with those who have a good reputation, which can be acquired by helping others. However, this mechanism requires the population to agree on who has good or bad moral standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution of reputational judgment: a compulsory contribution from each member of the population, i.e., a tax. We analyze the maximum possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how often an institution must be audited to prevent bribery. Our analysis has implications for the establishment of robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations--and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.</description>
