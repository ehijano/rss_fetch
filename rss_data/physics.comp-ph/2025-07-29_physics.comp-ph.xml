      <title>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based Model-Order Reduction for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a projection-based model-order reduction (MOR) technique for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, which is a mesh-free approach within the Lagrangian framework. Our approach utilizes the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique to generate a subspace basis for the reduction process.
  The main objective of this study is to conduct an initial exploration of the feasibility of employing POD-based MOR (POD-MOR) in SPH simulations and to quantify the associated POD error. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we consider the friction stir spot welding problem, which involves the coupling of flow equations and heat equation.
  Our findings reveal that, with the same degrees of freedom, POD-MOR significantly reduces computational error compared to the uniform reduction of particle numbers in SPH simulations.
  Additionally, the acceleration technique of POD-MOR for SPH simulation via linearization and freezing coefficients has been shown to be effective while keeping the error small. We have also showed the effectiveness of POD-MOR in predictive settings in SPH simulations with different parameter values.</description>

      <title>Multi-Resolution Training-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Multi-Scale PDE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-scale PDE problems present significant challenges in scientific computing. While conventional MLP-based deep learning methods exhibit spectral bias in resolving multi-scale features, the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (PIKAN) mitigates this issue through its novel architecture, demonstrating certain advantages. On the other hand, insights from the information bottleneck theory suggest that high-resolution training points are essential for these hybrid methods to accurately capture multi-scale behavior, although this requirement often leads to longer training times. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective multi-resolution training-enhanced PIKAN framework, termed MR-PIKAN, which trains the data-physics hybrid model either sequentially or alternately across different resolutions. The proposed MR-PIKAN is validated on various multi-scale forward and inverse PDE problems. Numerical results indicate that this new training strategy effectively reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy, thereby enabling efficient solutions of complex multi-scale PDEs in both forward and inverse settings.</description>

      <title>Iterative Pretraining Framework for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>Parallel athermal quasistatic deformation stepping of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The athermal quasistatic deformation method provides an elegant solution to overcome the limitation of short time spans in molecular simulations. It provides overdamped conditions, allowing for the extraction of purely structural responses in the absence of thermal vibration. However, it requires computationally expensive sequences of affine deformation followed by minimization of the potential energy to incrementally find the path in the potential energy landscape that corresponds to the correct solution trajectory. Therefore, we propose an athermal parallel stepping scheme that significantly improves the computational time necessary to find the correct solution trajectory using a multi-thread approach. Our approach proposes athermal stepping at two levels. Level I stepping provides a sequence of initial guesses at large increments by affine deformation of the system and land-marking anchor points on the potential energy landscape. Level II stepping performs a set of individual finely resolved athermal quasistatic deformation steps between the inherent structures of the initial level I guesses executed in parallel. The evaluated candidate trajectory is then verified by consecutively comparing the configuration of every last level II result with the corresponding inherent structure of the level I guesses at the same strain states. If the two configurations are not equivalent, the solution must be rejected and recalculated from this point. Rigorous numerical testing with $4,8,16$ and $32$ parallel threads demonstrates that our method achieves computational speed-ups of factors ranging from $1.49$ to $27.09$, with averages of $3.0$ to $6.62$ depending on the number of threads, while maintaining simulation accuracy, offering a powerful new tool for athermal molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Processing and Memory with Spiking Resonant Tunnelling Diode Neurons and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing-modelled after the functionality and efficiency of biological neural systems-offers promising new directions for advancing artificial intelligence and computational models. Photonic techniques for neuromorphic computing hardware are attracting increasing research interest, thanks to their potentials for ultra high bandwidths, low-crosstalk and high parallelism. Among these, approaches based upon resonant tunnelling diodes (RTDs) have recently gained attention as potential building blocks for next-generation light-enabled neuromorphic hardware, due to their capacity to replicate key neuronal behaviours such as excitable spiking and refractoriness, added to their potentials for high operational speeds, energy efficiency and compact footprints. In particular, their ability to function as opto-electronic spiking neurons makes them strong candidates for integration into novel event based neuromorphic computing systems. This work demonstrates the application of optically-triggered spiking RTD neurons to a multiplicity of applications and architectures, these include systems based upon single elements for multi-modal (photonic-electronic) fast rising edge-detection in time-series data, the construction of a two-layer feedforward artificial photonic spiking neural network (pSNN) using RTD neurons as the nonlinear nodes delivering excellent performance in complex dataset classification tasks, and a pSNN comprised of multiple coupled light-sensitive RTD spiking neurons that supports performance as an adjustable neuromorphic optical spiking memory system with a tunable storage time of spiking patterns.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Efficient Convolution through Sparse Matrix Encoding and Low-Depth Inner Product Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolution operations are foundational to classical image processing and modern deep learning architectures, yet their extension into the quantum domain has remained algorithmically and physically costly due to inefficient data encoding and prohibitive circuit complexity. In this work, we present a resource-efficient quantum algorithm that reformulates the convolution product as a structured matrix multiplication via a novel sparse reshaping formalism. Leveraging the observation that localized convolutions can be encoded as doubly block-Toeplitz matrix multiplications, we construct a quantum framework wherein sparse input patches are prepared using optimized key-value QRAM state encoding, while convolutional filters are represented as quantum states in superposition. The convolution outputs are computed through inner product estimation using a low-depth SWAP test circuit, which yields probabilistic amplitude information with reduced sampling overhead. Our architecture supports batched convolution across multiple filters using a generalized SWAP circuit. Compared to prior quantum convolutional approaches, our method eliminates redundant preparation costs, scales logarithmically with input size under sparsity, and enables direct integration into hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipelines. This work provides a scalable and physically realizable pathway toward quantum-enhanced feature extraction, opening up new possibilities for quantum convolutional neural networks and data-driven quantum inference.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bayesian Data-Driven Design of Reliable Solder Joints for Micro-electronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading is a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold, critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.</description>

      <title>A Modified Dielectric Contrast based Integral Equation for 2D TE Scattering by Inhomogeneous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a modified domain integral equation approach for the forward problem of TE scattering, employing a modified definition of dielectric contrast and discretizing the electric field density using Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. The proposed formulation mitigates the numerical challenges introduced by the gradient-divergence operator in traditional electric field-based vector formulations. The use of RWG basis functions over triangular meshes enhances geometric conformity, ensures tangential continuity across dielectric interfaces, and facilitates the application of well known singularity extraction techniques for numerical accuracy. Validation through numerical experiments on a two-layered dielectric cylinder demonstrates excellent agreement between computed and analytical scattered fields. Convergence studies confirm improving solution accuracy with mesh refinement indicating robustness with respect to discretization without increasing the iterations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Schiff moment of fluorine isotope $^{19}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear Schiff moments (NSMs) are sensitive probes for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, signaling violations of time-reversal and parity-inversion symmetries in atomic nuclei. In this Letter, we report the first-ever calculation of a NSM in a nuclear ab initio framework, employing the no-core shell model to study the fluorine isotope $^{19}$F. We further perform quantum-chemistry calculations to evaluate the sensitivity of the hafnium monofluoride cation, HfF$^+$, to the NSM of $^{19}$F. Combined with recent high-precision measurements of the molecular electric dipole moment of HfF$^+$, our results enable the first experimental bound on the NSM of $^{19}$F.</description>

      <title>Deep Uzawa for Kinetic Transport with Lagrange-Enforced Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network framework for solving stationary linear transport equations with inflow boundary conditions. The method represents the solution using a neural network and imposes the boundary condition via a Lagrange multiplier, based on a saddle-point formulation inspired by the classical Uzawa algorithm. The scheme is mesh-free, compatible with automatic differentiation and extends naturally to problems with scattering and heterogeneous media. We establish convergence of the continuum formulation and analyse the effects of quadrature error, neural approximation and inexact optimisation in the discrete implementation. Numerical experiments show that the method captures anisotropic transport, enforces boundary conditions and resolves scattering dynamics accurately.</description>

      <title>Solving the MIT Inverse Problem by Considering Skin and Proximity Effects in Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved technique for solving the inverse problem in magnetic induction tomography (MIT) by considering skin and proximity effects in coils. MIT is a non-contact, noninvasive, and low-cost imaging modality for obtaining the distribution of conductivity inside an object. Reconstruction of low conductivity distribution by MIT requires more accurate techniques since measured signals are inherently weak and the reconstruction problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed. Previous MIT inverse problem studies have ignored skin and proximity effects inside coils in the forward method. In this article, the improved technique incorporates these effects in the forward method. Furthermore, it employs the regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm to reconstruct the conductivity distribution. The regularization parameter is obtained by an adaptive method using the two input parameters: a coefficient and an initial conductivity distribution. The new Jacobian matrix is computed based on a standard technique. To compare the early and improved forward methods in possible medical and industrial applications with low conductivity regions, a 2D 8-coil MIT system is modeled, and image reconstruction is performed for synthetic phantoms. Results show that it is crucial to use the improved forward method for the reconstruction of the absolute conductivity values.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Link Between Nanomorphology and Energetic Disorder in 3D Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is highly sensitive to both nanomorphology and energetic disorder arising from microscopic molecular packing and structural defects. However, most models used to understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium approximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we present the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating at both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic disorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach that accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these example morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic disorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of real device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of the nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results reveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact, energetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge extraction in interconnected domains. This suggest that optimizing molecular packing at the nanoscale is as critical as controlling phase separation at the mesoscale, highlighting the need for multiscale design strategies in next-generation BHJ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of nanophotonics demands theoretical frameworks capable of predicting the resonant behavior of complex systems comprising constituents of varying nature, operating beyond the weak-coupling, high-Q regime where classical temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is applicable. This work presents a coupled-quasinormal-mode (cQNM) framework for analyzing dissipative coupling with photonic and plasmonic resonators. The framework provides rigorous closed-form expressions for dissipative coupling coefficients and introduces novel features, such as a new coupling scheme via time derivatives of excitation coefficients. It delivers transparent and accurate predictions of exotic phenomena-such as zero-coupling between very close cavities and level-attraction effects that are only vaguely captured by traditional CMT models. Efficient and user-friendly, this framework facilitates rapid parameter space exploration for device design and offers potential for extension to nonlinear and quantum systems in future applications.</description>

      <title>A generalized ENO reconstruction in compact GKS for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized ENO (GENO)-type nonlinear reconstruction scheme for compressible flow simulations. The proposed reconstruction preserves the accuracy of the linear scheme while maintaining essentially non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities. By generalizing the adaptive philosophy of ENO schemes, the method employs a smooth path function that directly connects high-order linear reconstruction with a reliable lower-order alternative. This direct adaptive approach significantly simplifies the construction of nonlinear schemes, particularly for very high-order methods on unstructured meshes. A comparative analysis with various WENO methods demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the proposed reconstruction, which provides an optimal transition between linear and nonlinear reconstructions across all limiting cases based on stencil smoothness. The consistency and performance of the GENO reconstruction are validated through implementation in both high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes (GKS) and non-compact Riemann-solver-based methods. Benchmark tests confirm the robustness and shock-capturing capabilities of GENO, with particularly superior performance when integrated with compact schemes. This work advances the construction methodology of nonlinear schemes and establishes ENO-type reconstruction as a mature and practical approach for engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: Particle-laden flows are simulated at various scales using numerical techniques that range from particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations (pr-DNS) for small-scale systems to Lagrange point-particle methods for laboratory-scale problems, and Euler-Euler approaches for larger-scale applications. Recent research has been particularly focused on the development of both physics-based and data-driven closures to enhance the accuracy of the Lagrangian point-particle approach by leveraging highly resolved data from pr-DNS. In this study, a data-driven methodology is presented for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on spherical particles immersed in an ambient flow field, where neighboring particle information is represented by volume fractions. The volume fractions are computed on an auxiliary grid with cell sizes on the order of the particle diameter. The volume fraction values in the vicinity of each particle are used as input features for the data-driven model to predict the corresponding hydrodynamic forces and moments. The training data was generated by a series of pr-DNS of flow through arrays of randomly distributed, fixed-position particles at various Reynolds numbers and particle volume fractions. The data-driven model is built using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN). Improved prediction accuracy of hydrodynamic forces and torques is demonstrated in comparison to FCNN models that rely on direct particle position inputs. In addition, the proposed volume-fraction-based approach exhibits greater flexibility than previously introduced models by accommodating systems with particles of different sizes and shapes.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Predicting the Enthalpy of Mixing inBinary Liquids Based on Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is an important property for predicting phase formation in alloys. It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Precision Ceiling in Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Hybrid Fourier-Neural Architecture for Ultra-High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Data-parallel leading-order event generation in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUDACPP plugin for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO aims to accelerate leading order tree-level event generation by providing the MadEvent event generator with data-parallel helicity amplitudes. These amplitudes are written in templated C++ and CUDA, allowing them to be compiled for CPUs supporting SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 instruction sets as well as CUDA- and HIP-enabled GPUs. Using SIMD instruction sets, CUDACPP-generated amplitudes are shown to speed up linearly with SIMD register size, and GPU offloading is shown to provide acceleration beyond that of SIMD instructions. Additionally, the resulting speed-up in event generation perfectly aligns with predictions from measured runtime fractions spent in amplitude routines, and proper GPU utilisation can speed up high-multiplicity QCD processes by an order of magnitude when compared to optimal CPU usage in server-grade CPUs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonlinear System with Machine Learning: Chua and Lorenz Circuits Analyzed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear circuits serve as crucial carriers and physical models for investigating nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior, particularly in the simulation of biological neurons. In this study, Chua's circuit and Lorenz circuit are systematically explored for the first time through machine learning correlation algorithms. Specifically, the upgraded and optimized SINDy-PI model, which is based on neural network and symbolic regression algorithm, is utilized to learn the numerical results of attractors generated by these two nonlinear circuits. Through error analysis, we examine the effects of the precision of input data and the amount of data on the algorithmic model. The findings reveal that when the input data quantity and data precision fall within a certain range, the algorithm model can effectively recognize and restore the differential equation expressions corresponding to the two circuits. Additionally, we test the anti-interference ability of different circuits and the robustness of the algorithm by introducing noise into the test data. The results indicate that under the same noise disturbance, the Lorenz circuit has better noise resistance than Chua's circuit, providing a starting point for further studying the intrinsic properties and characteristics of different nonlinear circuits. The above results will not only offer a reference for the further study of nonlinear circuits and related systems using deep learning algorithms but also lay a preliminary theoretical foundation for the study of related physical problems and applications.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the dynamical closure of spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations. Employing the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics to embed the original classical dynamics into an infinite dimensional quantum mechanical system, we use the space of quantum states to model the unresolved degrees of freedom of the original dynamics and the framework of quantum measurement to predict their contributions to the resolved dynamics. The embedded dynamics is projected to finite dimension by a positivity preserving discretization process. Based on methods from operator valued kernels and delay embedding, the compressed finite dimensional representation of the dynamics is invariant under the spatial symmetries of the original dynamics. We develop a data driven formulation of the scheme that can be realized numerically and apply it to a dynamical closure problem for the shallow water equations. The results demonstrate that our closure model can accurately predict the main features of the true dynamics, including for out of sample initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Higher order Jacobi method for solving system of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi iterative method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher order Jacobi method (HOJM), structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that allows efficient resolution of system variations without recomputing the coefficients, once the network parameters are trained for a known system. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach goes beyond conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis on GPU reveals significant enhancement in the order of complexity, highlighting a compelling and transformative direction for advancing algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</description>

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Designing Two-Dimensional Octuple-Atomic-Layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ as Promising Photocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.</description>
