      <title>G-Style: Stylized Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce G-Style, a novel algorithm designed to transfer the style of an image onto a 3D scene represented using Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the original scene content. During the stylization process and following the original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Comparing Crowd Simulations: Perspectives from a Crowd Authoring Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd simulation is a research area widely used in diverse fields, including gaming and security, assessing virtual agent movements through metrics like time to reach their goals, speed, trajectories, and densities. This is relevant for security applications, for instance, as different crowd configurations can determine the time people spend in environments trying to evacuate them. In this work, we extend WebCrowds, an authoring tool for crowd simulation, to allow users to build scenarios and evaluate them through a set of metrics. The aim is to provide a quantitative metric that can, based on simulation data, select the best crowd configuration in a certain environment. We conduct experiments to validate our proposed metric in multiple crowd simulation scenarios and perform a comparison with another metric found in the literature. The results show that experts in the domain of crowd scenarios agree with our proposed quantitative metric.</description>

      <title>SkillMimic: Learning Reusable Basketball Skills from Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mastering basketball skills such as diverse layups and dribbling involves complex interactions with the ball and requires real-time adjustments. Traditional reinforcement learning methods for interaction skills rely on labor-intensive, manually designed rewards that do not generalize well across different skills. Inspired by how humans learn from demonstrations, we propose SkillMimic, a data-driven approach that mimics both human and ball motions to learn a wide variety of basketball skills. SkillMimic employs a unified configuration to learn diverse skills from human-ball motion datasets, with skill diversity and generalization improving as the dataset grows. This approach allows training a single policy to learn multiple skills, enabling smooth skill switching even if these switches are not present in the reference dataset. The skills acquired by SkillMimic can be easily reused by a high-level controller to accomplish complex basketball tasks. To evaluate our approach, we introduce two basketball datasets: one estimated through monocular RGB videos and the other using advanced motion capture equipment, collectively containing about 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Experiments show that our method can effectively learn various basketball skills included in the dataset with a unified configuration, including various styles of dribbling, layups, and shooting. Furthermore, by training a high-level controller to reuse the acquired skills, we can achieve complex basketball tasks such as layup scoring, which involves dribbling toward the basket, timing the dribble and layup to score, retrieving the rebound, and repeating the process. The project page and video demonstrations are available at https://ingrid789.github.io/SkillMimic/</description>

      <title>Re-Nerfing: Improving Novel View Synthesis through Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neural rendering and reconstruction techniques, such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splatting, have shown remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities but require hundreds of images of the scene from diverse viewpoints to render high-quality novel views. With fewer images available, these methods start to fail since they can no longer correctly triangulate the underlying 3D geometry and converge to a non-optimal solution. These failures can manifest as floaters or blurry renderings in sparsely observed areas of the scene. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general add-on approach that leverages novel view synthesis itself to tackle this problem. Using an already trained NVS method, we render novel views between existing ones and augment the training data to optimize a second model. This introduces additional multi-view constraints and allows the second model to converge to a better solution. With Re-Nerfing we achieve significant improvements upon multiple pipelines based on NeRF and Gaussian-Splatting in sparse view settings of the mip-NeRF 360 and LLFF datasets. Notably, Re-Nerfing does not require prior knowledge or extra supervision signals, making it a flexible and practical add-on.</description>
