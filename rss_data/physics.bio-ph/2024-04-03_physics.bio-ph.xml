      <title>Path planning of magnetic microswimmers in high-fidelity simulations of capillaries with deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, microsurgery or sensing rely on reaching precise areas within the body in a minimally invasive way. Artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs) have emerged as potential tools for this task by navigating through the circulatory system. While the control and swimming characteristics of ABFs is understood in simple scenarios, their behavior within the bloodstream remains unclear. We conduct simulations of ABFs evolving in the complex capillary networks found in the human retina. The ABF is robustly guided to a prescribed target by a reinforcement learning agent previously trained on a reduced order model.</description>

      <title>Information propagation in far-from-equilibrium molecular templating networks is optimised by pseudo-equilibrium systems with negligible dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-from equilibrium molecular templating networks, like those that maintain the populations of RNA and protein molecules in the cell, are key biological motifs. These networks share the general property that assembled products are produced and degraded via complex pathways controlled by catalysts, including molecular templates. Although it has been suggested that the information propagated from templates to products sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of these networks, this bound has not been explored rigorously to date. We show that, for an arbitrarily catalytic reaction network in steady state, the specificity with which a single product can dominate the ensemble is upper bounded, and the entropy of the product ensemble lower bounded, by a function of $\Delta G$, the difference between the maximal and minimal free-energy changes along pathways to assembly. These simple bounds are particularly restrictive for systems with a smaller number of possible products $M$. Remarkably, however, although $\Delta G$ constrains the information propagated to the product distribution, the systems that saturate the bound operate in a pseudo-equilibrium fashion, and there is no minimal entropy production rate for maintaining this non-equilibrium distribution. Moreover, for large systems, a vanishingly small subset of the possible products can dominate the product ensemble even for small values of $\Delta G/\ln M$.</description>

      <title>An Information Bottleneck Approach for Markov Model Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are valuable for studying dynamics of protein conformational changes via statistical analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In MSMs, the complex configuration space is coarse-grained into conformational states, with the dynamics modeled by a series of Markovian transitions among these states at discrete lag times. Constructing the Markovian model at a specific lag time requires state defined without significant internal energy barriers, enabling internal dynamics relaxation within the lag time. This process coarse grains time and space, integrating out rapid motions within metastable states. This work introduces a continuous embedding approach for molecular conformations using the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), which unifies dimensionality reduction and state space partitioning via a continuous, machine learned basis set. Without explicit optimization of VAMP-based scores, SPIB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying slow dynamical processes and constructing predictive multi-resolution Markovian models. When applied to mini-proteins trajectories, SPIB showcases unique advantages compared to competing methods. It automatically adjusts the number of metastable states based on a specified minimal time resolution, eliminating the need for manual tuning. While maintaining efficacy in dynamical properties, SPIB excels in accurately distinguishing metastable states and capturing numerous well-populated macrostates. Furthermore, SPIB's ability to learn a low-dimensional continuous embedding of the underlying MSMs enhances the interpretation of dynamic pathways. Accordingly, we propose SPIB as an easy-to-implement methodology for end-to-end MSM construction.</description>

      <title>Subconductance states in a semimicroscopic model for a tetrameric pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical model for a structured tetrameric pore is studied. The pore is modeled as a device composed of four subunits, each one exhibiting two possible states (open and closed). The pore is located within a membrane that separates two reservoirs with ionic solutions. All variables of the model follow physical dynamical equations accounting for the internal structure of the pore, derived from a single energy functional and supplemented with thermal noises. An extensive study of the resulting ionic intensity is performed for different values of the control parameters, mainly membrane potential and reservoir ion concentrations. Two possible physical devices are studied: voltage-gated (including a voltage sensor in each subunit) and non-voltage-gated pores. The ionic flux through the pore exhibits several distinct dynamical configurations, in particular subconductance states, which indicate very different dynamical internal states of the subunits. Such subconductance states become much easier to observe in sensorless pores. These results are compared with available experimental data on tetrameric K channels and analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>RNA Dynamics from Experimental and Computational Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are unique in that they can store genetic information, replicate and perform catalysis. Importantly, RNA molecules are highly dynamic, and thus determining the ensemble of conformations that they populate is crucial not only to elucidate their biological functions, but also for their potential use as therapeutic targets. Computational and experimental techniques provide complementary views on RNA dynamics, and their integration is fundamental to improve the accuracy of computations and the resolution of experiments. Recent exciting developments in this field, were discussed at the CECAM workshop ``RNA dynamics from experimental and computational approaches'', in Paris, June 26-28, 2023. This report outlines key `take-home' messages that emerged during this workshop from the presentations and discussions.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Biomolecular Simulations in the Exascale Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of biological systems and processes, spanning molecular to macroscopic scales, necessitates the use of multiscale simulations to get a comprehensive understanding. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for capturing processes beyond the reach of classical MD simulations. The advent of exascale computing offers unprecedented opportunities for scientific exploration, not least within life sciences, where simulations are essential to unravel intricate molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. However, leveraging the immense computational power of exascale computing requires innovative algorithms and software designs. In this context, we discuss the current status and future prospects of multiscale biomolecular simulations on exascale supercomputers with a focus on QM/MM MD. We highlight our own efforts in developing a versatile and high-performance multiscale simulation framework with the aim of efficient utilization of state-of-the-art supercomputers. We showcase its application in uncovering complex biological mechanisms and its potential for leveraging exascale computing.</description>
