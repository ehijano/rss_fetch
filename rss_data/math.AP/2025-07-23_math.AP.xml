      <title>Asymptotic behavior at infinity and existence of solutions to the Lagrangian mean curvature flow equation in $\mathbb R^{n+1}_-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior at infinity of ancient solutions to the Lagrangian mean curvature flow equation. Under conditions that admit Liouville type rigidity theorems, we prove that every classical solution converges exponentially to a quadratic polynomial of form $\tau t+\frac{1}{2}x'Ax+bx+c$ at infinity, with an explicitly derived convergence rate. Furthermore, we investigate Dirichlet type problems with prescribed asymptotic behavior, featuring two key innovations: applicability to all dimensions $n\geq 2$, and no requirement for the matrix $A$ to be positive definite or close to a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. These results establish the relationship among Liouville type rigidity, asymptotic analysis at infinity, and boundary value problems (including Dirichlet type and initial value type).</description>

      <title>Analysis of a three-dimensional rapidly rotating convection model without thermal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional rapidly rotating convection model featuring tall columnar structures, in the absence of thermal diffusion. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, as well as the Hadamard well-posedness of global strong solutions to this model. The lack of thermal diffusion introduces significant challenges in the analysis. To overcome these challenges, we first investigate the regularized model with thermal diffusion and establish delicate estimates that are independent of the thermal diffusion coefficient, and consequently justify the vanishing diffusivity limit. This work serves as a continuation of our previous paper [6].</description>

      <title>Suppression of blow-up in 3-D Keller-Segel system with fractional diffusion via Couette flow in whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Keller-Segel model with a fractional diffusion term in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the background of a Couette flow. We show that when the background Couette flow is large enough, the dissipation enhancement induced could prevent the blow-up of solutions and thus prove the global existence and also obtain time decay rates of the solution in $L^p$ norm. The main tool of the proof is a corresponding Green's function and the key estimate is its $L^1$ estimate without singularities at $t=0$. To fulfill such an estimate, we meet great troubles caused by the fractional heat kernel together with the Couette flow in the model considered here and overcome the troubles by introducing a space-frequency mixed decomposition.</description>

      <title>Sovability of curvature equations with multiple singular sources on torus via Painleve VI equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the curvature equation with multiple singular sources on a torus \[\Delta u+e^{u}=8\pi \sum_{k=0}^{3}n_{k}\delta_{\frac{\omega_{k}}{2}}% +4\pi \left( \delta_{p}+\delta_{-p}\right) \quad \text{ on }\;E_{\tau}:=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb Z+\mathbb{Z}\tau),\] where $n_k\in\mathbb N$ and $\delta_a$ denotes the Dirac measure at $a$. This is known as a critical case for which the apriori estimate does not hold, and the existence of solutions has been a long-standing problem. In this paper, by establishing a deep connection with Painlev\'{e} VI equations, we show that the existence of even solutions (i.e. $u(z)=u(-z)$) depends on the location of the singular point $p$, and we give a sharp criterion of $p$ in terms of Painlev\'{e} VI equations.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness and asymptotic analysis of a nonlocal incompressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a relaxed formulation of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system, where the classical third-order capillarity term is replaced by a nonlocal approximation. We first establish the local-in-time well-posedness of the relaxed system, under standard regularity and positivity assumptions on the initial data. The existence time is uniform with respect to both the capillarity coefficient and the relaxation parameter. We then study two asymptotic limits of the system: the nonlocal-to-local limit as the relaxation parameter tends to infinity, and the vanishing capillarity limit. In each case, we prove convergence of the solution to that of the corresponding target system. Our analysis provides a rigorous justification for the use of nonlocal relaxation models in approximating capillarity-driven incompressible fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Sharp Boundary Growth Rate Estimate of the Singular Equation $-\Delta u=u^{-\gamma}$ in a Critical Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\gamma&gt;0$, we study the sharp boundary growth rate estimate of solutions to the Dirichlet problem of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u=u^{-\gamma} \end{equation*} in a critical $C^{1,1}$ epigraphical cone $Cone_{\Sigma}$.
  We show that the growth rate estimate exhibits fundamentally different behaviors in the following three cases: $1&lt;\gamma&lt;2$, $\gamma=2$, and $\gamma&gt;2$. Moreover, we obtain the sharp growth rate estimate near the origin for $\gamma&gt;1$. As a consequence, we show that when $Cone_{\Sigma}$ is a $C^{1,1}$ epigraphical cone, the additional solvability condition in \cite[Theorem 1.3]{GuLiZh25} is both sufficient and necessary to achieve the growth rate therein, thereby resolving the main open question left in that paper. With the growth rate estimate, we also derive the optimal modulus of continuity for solutions via the interior Schauder estimate.
  Our approach is to control the values of a solution $U(x)$ in the region $\Omega=Cone_{\Sigma}\cap B_{1}$ by introducing a sequence of reference points $p_{k}=\frac{16^{1-k}}{2}\vec{e_{n}}$. From the Green function representation of $U(x)$, we derive a discrete integral equation for the sequence $a_{k}=16^{k\phi}U(p_{k})$. Such a computation converts the original PDE problem into a recursion for a discrete integral equation, which can be effectively analyzed using basic ODE methods.</description>

      <title>Bounded $H^\infty$-calculus for vectorial-valued operators with Gaussian kernel estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the vector-valued generator of a bounded holomorphic semigroup represented by a kernel satisfying Gaussian estimates with bounded $H^\infty$-calculus in $L^2(\mathbb R^d;\mathbb C^m)$ admits bounded $H^\infty$-calculus for every $p\in (1,\infty)$. We apply this result to the elliptic operator $-{\rm div}(Q\nabla)+V$, where the potential term V is a matrix-valued function whose entries belong to $L^1_{\rm loc}(\mathbb R^d)$ and, for almost every $x\in \mathbb R^d$, $V(x)$ is a symmetric and nonnegative definite matrix.</description>

      <title>The fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem: Liouville theorems and counterexamples to local boundary estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a complete classification of positive viscosity solutions $w$ to conformally invariant equations of the form
  \begin{align}\label{ab}\tag{$*$}
  \begin{cases}
  f(\lambda(-A_w)) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lambda(-A_w)\in\Gamma &amp; \text{in }\mathbb{R}_+^n \newline
  w = 0 &amp; \text{on }\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $A_w$ is the Schouten tensor of the metric $g_w = w^{-2}|dx|^2$, $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a symmetric convex cone and $f$ is an associated defining function satisfying standard assumptions. Solutions to \eqref{ab} yield metrics $g_w$ of negative curvature-type which are locally complete near $\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n$. In particular, when $(f,\Gamma) = (\sigma_1,\Gamma_1^+)$, \eqref{ab} is the Loewner-Nirenberg problem in the upper half-space.
  More precisely, let $\mu_\Gamma^+$ denote the unique constant satisfying $(-\mu_\Gamma^+, 1,\dots,1)\in\partial\Gamma$. We show that when $\mu_\Gamma^+ &gt;1$ (e.g. when $\Gamma = \Gamma_k^+$ for $k&lt;\frac{n}{2}$), the hyperbolic solution $w^{(0)}(x) := x_n$ is the unique solution to \eqref{ab}. More surprisingly, we show that when $\mu_\Gamma^+ \leq 1$ (e.g. when $\Gamma = \Gamma_k^+$ for $k\geq \frac{n}{2}$), the solution set consists of a monotonically increasing one-parameter family $\{w^{(a)}(x_n)\}_{a\geq 0}$, of which the hyperbolic solution $w^{(0)}$ is the minimal solution. In either case, solutions of \eqref{ab} are functions of $x_n$. Our proof involves a novel application of the method of moving spheres for which we must establish new estimates and regularity near $\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n$, followed by a delicate ODE analysis. As an application, we give counterexamples to local boundary $C^0$ estimates on solutions to the fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem when $\mu_\Gamma^+ \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>The $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem on Riemannian manifolds for $k=\frac{n}{2}$ and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g_0)$ be a smooth compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ with smooth non-empty boundary $\partial M$. Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a symmetric convex cone and $f$ a symmetric defining function for $\Gamma$ satisfying standard assumptions. Denoting by $A_{g_u}$ the Schouten tensor of a conformal metric $g_u = u^{-2}g_0$, we show that the associated fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  f(\lambda(-g_u^{-1}A_{g_u})) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lambda(-g_u^{-1}A_{g_u})\in\Gamma &amp; \text{on }M\backslash \partial M \newline
  u = 0 &amp; \text{on }\partial M
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  admits a solution if $\mu_\Gamma^+ &gt; 1-\delta$, where $\mu_\Gamma^+$ is defined by $(-\mu_\Gamma^+,1,\dots,1)\in\partial\Gamma$ and $\delta&gt;0$ is a constant depending on certain geometric data. In particular, we solve the $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem for all $k\leq \frac{n}{2}$, which extends recent work of the authors to include the important threshold case $k=\frac{n}{2}$. In the process, we establish that the fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem and corresponding Dirichlet boundary value problem with positive boundary data admit solutions if there exists a conformal metric $g\in[g_0]$ such that $\lambda(-g^{-1}A_g)\in\Gamma$ on $M$; these latter results require no assumption on $\mu_\Gamma^+$ and are new when $(1,0,\dots,0)\in\partial\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Second-order boundary estimates for solutions to a class of quasilinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global second-order regularity for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations, both with homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. A condition on the integrability of the second fundamental form on the boundary of the domain is required. As a consequence, with the additional assumption that the source term has a sign, we obtain integrability properties of the inverse of the gradient of the solution. Assuming convexity of the domain, no boundary regularity is required.</description>

      <title>The Fujita exponent for a heat equation with mixed local and nonlocal nonlinearities on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the problems of local and global solvability for a semilinear heat equation on the Heisenberg group involving a mixed local and nonlocal nonlinearity. The characteristic features of such equations, arising from the interplay between the geometric structure of the Heisenberg group and the combined nonlinearity, are analyzed in detail. The need to distinguish between subcritical and supercritical regimes is identified and justified through rigorous analysis. On the basis of the study, the author suggests precise conditions under which local-in-time mild solutions exist uniquely for regular, nonnegative initial data. It is proved that global existence holds under appropriate growth restrictions on the nonlinear terms. To complement these results, it is shown, by employing the capacity method, that solutions cannot exist globally in time when the nonlinearity exceeds a critical threshold. As a result, the Fujita exponent is formulated and identified as the dividing line between global existence and finite-time blow-up. In addition, lifespan estimates were obtained in the supercritical regime, providing insight into how the size of the initial data influences the time of blow-up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the Cauchy problem for the three-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosities given by $\mu=\rho^\alpha,\lambda=\rho^\alpha(\alpha&gt;0)$. We establish the global existence and optimal decay rates of classical solutions under the assumptions of small initial data in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)\cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and the viscosity constraint $|\alpha-1|\ll 1$. The key idea of our proof lies in the combination of Green's function method, energy method and a time-decay regularity criterion. In contrast to previous works, the Sobolev norms of the spatial derivatives of the initial data may be arbitrarily large in our analysis</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a phase-field model is introduced to describe the evolution of a deformable, self-propelled object driven by surface-tension effects. The model couples an Allen-Cahn-type equation, which distinguishes the body from the surrounding fluid, with a reaction-diffusion equation for the surfactant concentration. As the interface-thickness parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, it is shown that the phase-field model converges to a sharp-interface limit coupled with a reaction-diffusion equation. In particular, the normal velocity is given by the mean curvature, surface tension, and volume-preserving effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the class of nonnegative vorticities on the half-plane, we establish the Lyapunov stability of finite sums of Lamb dipoles under the initial assumptions that the dipoles are sufficiently separated and that the faster dipoles are positioned to the right of the slower ones. Our approach combines sharp energy estimates near the Lamb dipoles with a Lagrangian bootstrapping scheme, enabling us to quantify the exchanges of circulation, enstrophy, impulse, and energy between various parts of the solution. The strategy of the proof is robust, and we present several potential extensions of the result.</description>

Following the ideas of the recent work by Conti, Galimberti, Gatti, and Giorgini [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 64(3):Paper No. 87, 32, 2025] for the Cahn--Hilliard equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, we show the uniqueness of weak solutions together with a continuous dependence estimate for sufficiently regular mobility functions. Next, under weaker assumptions on the mobility functions, we show the existence of a weak solution that exhibits the propagation of uniform-in-time regularity and satisfies the instantaneous separation property. Lastly, we consider the long-time behavior and prove that the unique weak solution converges to a solution of the stationary bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard equation. Our approach for the uniqueness proof relies on a new well-posedness and regularity theory for a bulk-surface elliptic system with non-constant coefficients, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stability of an elastodynamic system with localized internal damping and acoustic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a stability result for an elastodynamic system with acoustic boundary conditions and localized internal damping, defined in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Here, the internal damping is only assumed to be locally distributed and satisfies suitable assumptions. The smooth boundary of $\Omega$ is $\Gamma=\Gamma_0\cup\Gamma_1$ such that $\overline{\Gamma_0}\cap\overline{\Gamma_1}=\emptyset$. On $\Gamma_0$, we consider the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, and on $\Gamma_1$ , we consider the acoustic boundary condition without a damping term. More precisely, by making use of semigroup techniques, well-posedness results are discussed, as well as the asymptotic behavior of solutions. The difficulty in establishing the stability of the system arises from the presence of higher-order operators, normal derivatives, and some boundary terms. The key tools combine the multiplier approach, trace theorems, ideas from Frota and Vicent\'e \cite{FrotaVicente2018}, and new technical arguments.</description>

      <title>Trace and Observability Inequalities for Laplace Eigenfunctions on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities
  $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$
  hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we use the relation obtained by Guillarmou--Guillop\'e and Chang--Gonz\'alez between the generalized eigenvalue problem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds and the Conformal Laplacian, to obtain a new inverse scattering result: on an AH manifold of dimension $n+1$, we show that the scattering matrix at energy $\frac{n+1}{2}$ determines the jet of the metric on the boundary, up to a diffeomorphism and conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to Nonlinear Diffusion with Memory in Random Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a nonlinear diffusion equation with memory and spatial randomness: $$u_t=\nabla\cdot \big( D(x,w)\cdot\int_0^t K(t-s) \nabla\cdot\Phi(u(x,s))ds \big)+f(x,t)$$ where $K$ is memory Kernel and $D(x,w)$ is bounded random coefficient. Under monotonicity and growth conditions on $\Phi$, the existence and uniqueness of weak solution is established. The analysis employs Orthogonal approximation, energy estimates, and monotone operator theory. The convolution structure is handled within variational frameworks. The result provides a rigorous basis for studying memory-type diffusion in heterogeneous media.</description>

Abstract: We establish orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations on torus and waveguide manifold. In the process, we also improve $\ell^2$ decoupling inequality and establish classical fractional Strichartz estimates on waveguide manifold. This maybe of independent interest. As an application, we establish local well-posednes for the Hartree equations with infinitely many particles with non-trace class initial data.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Robin eigenfunctions on convex domains of $\mathbb R^n$ are $H^2$ regular regardless of the sign of the parameter involved in the boundary conditions. The proof is an adaptation of a classical argument used in the case of positive parameters combined with a Rellich-Pohozaev identity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of global finite energy solutions of the Maxwell-scalar field system in Lorenz gauge on the Einstein cylinder. Our method is a combination of a conformal patching argument, the finite energy existence theorem in Lorenz gauge on Minkowski space of Selberg and Tesfahun, a careful localization of finite energy data, and null form estimates of Foschi-Klainerman type. Although we prove that the energy-carrying components of the solution maintain regularity, due to the incompleteness of the null structure in Lorenz gauge and the nature of our foliation-change arguments we find small losses of regularity in both the scalar field and the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study singularities of propagators and $N$-point functions for Dirac fields in a Coulomb potential, possibly with a $t$-dependent smooth part for $|t|&lt;T&lt;\infty$. We show that the in and out Dirac-Coulomb vacua are Hadamard states for $r\neq 0$. Furthermore, we prove that the relative charge density of any two Hadamard states is well-defined as a locally integrable function including near $r=0$. The results are based on a diffractive propagation of singularities theorem for the Dirac-Coulomb system previously obtained by the first and third authors, generalized here to the case of $t$-dependent potentials.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Adaptive Gradient Recovery for Unstructured Finite Volume Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven approach for enhancing gradient reconstruction in unstructured finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, specifically for the 2D Euler equations. Our approach extends previous structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network. The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance, while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver. The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on the results.</description>

      <title>From heteroclinic loops to homoclinic snaking in reversible systems: rigorous forcing through computer-assisted proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homoclinic snaking is a widespread phenomenon observed in many pattern-forming systems. Demonstrating its occurrence in non-perturbative regimes has proven difficult, although a forcing theory has been developed based on the identification of patterned front solutions. These heteroclinic solutions are themselves challenging to analyze due to the nonlinear nature of the problem. In this paper, we use computer-assisted proofs to find parameterized loops of heteroclinic connections between equilibria and periodic orbits in time reversible systems. This leads to a proof of homoclinic snaking in both the Swift-Hohenberg and Gray-Scott problems. Our results demonstrate that computer-assisted proofs of continuous families of connecting orbits in nonlinear dynamical systems are a powerful tool for understanding global dynamics and their dependence on parameters.</description>

      <title>Backwards uniqueness for Mean curvature flow with asymptotically conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that if two mean curvature flows of compact hypersurfaces $M^1_t$ and $M^2_t$ encounter only isolated, multiplicity one, asymptotically conical singularities at the first singular time $T$, and if $M^1_T=M^2_T$ then $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t\in [0,T]$. This is seemingly the first backwards uniqueness result for any geometric flow with singularities, that assumes neither {self-shrinking} nor global asymptotically conical {behaviour}. This necessitates the development of new global tools to deal with both the core of the singularity, its asymptotic structure, and the smooth part of the flows simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: We consider the system of Maxwell equations and Lorentz torque equation which describes a motion of charge in electromagnetic field. Under certain symmetry conditions on charge distribution and on initial fields the mass center of the charge remains fixed and the charge rotates around it. The system admits stationary soliton-type solutions. We study the Lyapunov and the orbital stability of the solitons exploiting the energy conservation law. We also show, by the angular momentum argument, that there is no attraction to a soliton of finite angular momentum on the surface of states of the same angular momentum.

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson systems in dimension two: the zero mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an existence result for a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in gradient form, set in the whole plane, in the case of zero mass. Since the setting is limiting for the Sobolev embedding, we admit nonlinearities with subcritical or critical growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. In particular, the absence of the mass term requires a nonstandard functional framework, based on homogeneous Sobolev spaces. These features, combined with the logarithmic behaviour of the kernel of the Poisson equation, make the analysis delicate, since standard variational tools cannot be applied. The system is solved by considering the corresponding logarithmic Choquard equation. The existence of a mountain pass-type solution is established by means of a careful analysis of appropriate Cerami sequences, whose boundedness is ensured through a nonstandard variational method, suggested by the subtle nature of the functional geometry involved. As a key tool in our estimates, we also introduce a logarithmic weighted Trudinger-Moser inequality, along with a related Cao-type inequality, both of which hold in our functional setting and are, we believe, of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of KP soliton structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KP) model placed in $\mathbb R_t \times \mathbb R_{x,y}^2$, in the case of smooth data that are not necessarily in a Sobolev space. In this paper, the subclass of smooth solutions we study is of ``soliton type'', characterized by a phase $\Theta=\Theta(t,x,y)$ and a unidimensional profile $F$. In particular, every classical KP soliton and multi-soliton falls into this category with suitable $\Theta$ and $F$. We establish concrete characterizations of KP solitons by means of a natural set of nonlinear differential equations and inclusions of functionals of Wronskian, Airy and Heat types, among others. These functional equations only depend on the new variables $\Theta$ and $F$. A distinct characteristic of this set of functionals is its special and rigid structure tailored to the considered soliton. By analyzing $\Theta$ and $F$, we establish the uniqueness of line-solitons, multi-solitons, and other degenerate solutions among a large class of KP solutions. Our results are also valid for other 2D dispersive models such as the quadratic and cubic Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations.</description>

Abstract: We provide a rigorous definition of quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole. They are obtained as the discrete set of poles of the meromorphically continued cutoff resolvent. The construction combines the method of complex scaling near asymptotically flat infinity with microlocal methods near the black hole horizon. We study the distribution of quasinormal modes in both the high and low energy regimes. We establish the existence of a high energy spectral gap and exclude the accumulation of quasinormal modes at zero energy.</description>

      <title>On stabilization at a soliton for generalized Korteweg--De Vries pure power equation for any power $p\in (1,5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply our idea, which previously we used in the analysis of the pure power NLS, consisting in spitting the virial inequality method into a large energy inequality combined with Kato smoothing, to the case of generalized Korteweg--De Vries pure power equations. We assume that a solution remains for all positive times very close to a soliton and then we prove an asymptotic stability result for $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>On a 1D nonlocal transport of the incompressible porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16238v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kiselev and Sarsam proposed the following nonlocal transport equation as a one-dimensional analogue of the 2D incompressible porous media (IPM) equation \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+u\partial_x\rho= 0,~u=gH_a\rho, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $H_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} H_af(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{a^2f(y)}{(x-y)((x-y)^2+a^2)}dy. \end{eqnarray*} In the work Kiselev-Sarsam (2025) [14], the authors proved the local well-posedness for this 1D periodic IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of smooth initial data. In this paper, we present several new weighted inequalities for the transform $H_a$ in the setting of the real line. Based on these integral inequalities, we also prove the finite time blow-up for this 1D IPM model on the real line.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear problems with mixed local-nonlocal operator and concave-critical nonlinearities: Multiplicity of positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for the following concave-critical problem driven by an operator of mixed order obtained by the sum of the classical $p$-Laplacian and of the fractional $p$-Laplacian, \begin{equation}\tag{$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$}
  -\Delta_p u+\varepsilon(-\Delta_p)^s u=\lambda|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p^*-2}u \;\text{ in }\Omega,\quad
  u=0 \; \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded open set, $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;q&lt;p&lt;N$, and $p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter. For $\lambda \leq 0$, we show that ($\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$) has no nontrivial solution. For $\lambda&gt;0$, we prove Ambrosetti-Brezis-Cerami type results. In particular, we prove the existence of $\Lambda_\varepsilon$ such that ($\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$) has a positive minimal solution for $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\Lambda_\varepsilon$, a positive solution for $\lambda=\Lambda_\varepsilon$ and no positive solution for $\lambda&gt;\Lambda_\varepsilon$. We also prove the existence of $0&lt;\lambda^\#\leq\Lambda_\varepsilon$ such that ($\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$) has at least two positive solutions for $\lambda\in(0,\lambda^\#)$ provided $\varepsilon$ small enough. This extends the recent result of Biagi and Vecchi (Nonlinear Anal. 256 (2025),113795), Amundsen, et al. (Commun. Pure Appl. Anal., 22(10):3139-3164, 2023) from $p=2$ to the general $1&lt;p&lt;N$. Additionally, it extends the classical result of Azorero and Peral (Indiana Univ. Math. J., 43(3):947-957, 1994) to the mixed local-nonlocal quasilinear problems. Moreover, our results complements the multiplicity results for nonnegative solutions in da Silva, et al. (J. Differential Equations, 408:494-536, 2024).</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions for HJB Equations on the Process Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a path dependent optimal control problem on the process space with both drift and volatility controls, with possibly degenerate volatility. The dynamic value function is characterized by a fully nonlinear second order path dependent HJB equation on the process space, which is by nature infinite dimensional. In particular, our model covers mean field control problems with common noise as a special case. We shall introduce a new notion of viscosity solutions and establish both the existence and the comparison principle, under merely Lipschitz/Holder continuity assumptions. The main feature of our notion is that, besides the standard smooth part, the test function consists of an extra singular component which allows us to handle the second order derivatives of the smooth test functions without invoking the Crandall-Ishii lemma. We shall use the doubling variable arguments, combined with the Ekeland-Borwein-Preiss variational principle in order to overcome the noncompactness of the state space. A smooth gauge-type function on the path space is crucial for our estimates.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for q-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Minkowski problem for the torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ} also studied the Minkowski problem {\it w.r.t.} $2$-torsional rigidity by method of curvature flows and obtain the existence of smooth even solutions. Up to now, as far as we know, the study of the Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity is still blank.
  In the present paper, we propose and investigate the Orlicz Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity corresponding to the $q$-Laplace equation inspired by the foregoing works, and then confirm the existence of smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by the method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>On low frequency inference for diffusions without the hot spots conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We remove the dependence on the `hot-spots' conjecture in two of the main theorems of the recent paper of Nickl (2024, Annals of Statistics). Specifically, we characterise the minimax convergence rates for estimation of the transition operator $P_{f}$ arising from the Neumann Laplacian with diffusion coefficient $f$ on arbitrary convex domains with smooth boundary, and further show that a general Lipschitz stability estimate holds for the inverse map $P_f\mapsto f$ from $H^2\to H^2$ to $L^1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for multivalued mckean-vlasov sdes with non-lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by Levy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>
