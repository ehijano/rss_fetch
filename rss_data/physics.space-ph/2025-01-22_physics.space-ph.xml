      <title>Kinetic-Scale Physics of a Multi-Species Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind affects the plasma environment around all solar system bodies. A strong solar wind dynamic pressure pushes plasma boundaries closer to these objects. For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion gyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may act differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important. Protons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the density of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of different solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the induced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer between the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields. Using the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios and analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density (E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary ions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density shows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to downstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger comet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer energy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and the pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in transferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton ratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further downstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass loading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most efficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since different ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual species.</description>

      <title>CME Observations -- from Sun to Impact on Geospace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our Sun is an active star expelling dynamic phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The magnetic field configuration on the Sun and related solar wind structures affect the propagation behavior of CMEs, dominate its transit time and embedded magnetic field properties when impacting Earth. Since the conditions on the Sun constantly change, the impact of CMEs on the different regimes of geospace is quite variable and may differ significantly from event to event. This short review summarizes the different manifestations of CMEs on the Sun, their appearance in interplanetary space, and how CMEs trigger a cascade of reactions as they interact with Earth.</description>

      <title>Tracing magnetic switchbacks to their source: An assessment of solar coronal jets as switchback precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of relativity of simultaneity used in the theory of special relativity, a new approach is proposed to simulate future solar wind conditions at any point in the inner solar system. An important distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the simulation in the solar corona is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms and is continuously simulated in nearly real time. The model for the inner heliosphere is based on time transformation to a boosted frame of reverence (or spacetime coordinate system) in which the current state of the solar wind at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary and future states of the solar wind are simultaneous. The predictive capability for tomorrow's parameters of the ambient solar wind at 1 AU is achieved by simulating them simultaneously with the current observations of the solar magnetic field, the time offset being due to the use of boosted frame.
  We derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and present a new numerical algorithm that solves the modified governing equations. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation and thus a significantly longer forecast time than traditional solution methods. In the numerical test for transient propagation, the boosted solution for the CME-driven shock arrival at 1AU is 16 hours ahead of the solution at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary.</description>
