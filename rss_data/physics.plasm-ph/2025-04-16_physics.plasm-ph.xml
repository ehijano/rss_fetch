      <title>Affordable, manageable, practical, and scalable (AMPS) high-yield and high-gain inertial fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-yield inertial fusion offers a transformative path to affordable clean firm power and advanced defense capabilities. Recent milestones at large facilities, particularly the National Ignition Facility (NIF), have demonstrated the feasibility of ignition but highlight the need for approaches that can deliver large amounts of energy to fusion targets at much higher efficiency and lower cost. We propose that pulser-driven inertial fusion energy (IFE), which uses high-current pulsed-power technology to compress targets to thermonuclear conditions, can achieve this goal. In this paper, we detail the physics basis for pulser IFE, focusing on magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF), where cylindrical metal liners compress DT fuel under strong magnetic fields and pre-heat. We discuss how the low implosion velocities, direct-drive efficiency, and scalable pulser architecture can achieve ignition-level conditions at low capital cost. Our multi-dimensional simulations, benchmarked against experiments at the Z facility, show that scaling from 20 MA to 50-60 MA of current enables net facility gain. We then introduce our Demonstration System (DS), a pulsed-power driver designed to deliver more than 60 MA and store approximately 80 MJ of energy. The DS is designed to achieve a 1000x increase in effective performance compared to the NIF, delivering approximately 100x greater facility-level energy gain -- and importantly, achieving net facility gain, or Qf&gt;1 -- at just 1/10 the capital cost. We also examine the engineering requirements for repetitive operation, target fabrication, and chamber maintenance, highlighting a practical roadmap to commercial power plants.</description>

      <title>Validation of FLASH for magnetically driven inertial confinement fusion target design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FLASH is a widely available radiation magnetohydrodynamics code used for astrophysics, laboratory plasma science, high energy density physics, and inertial confinement fusion. Increasing interest in magnetically driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF), including Pacific Fusion's development of a 60 MA Demonstration System designed to achieve facility gain, motivates the improvement and validation of FLASH for modeling magnetically driven ICF concepts, such as MagLIF, at ignition scale. Here we present a collection of six validation benchmarks from experiments at the Z Pulsed Power Facility and theoretical and simulation studies of scaling MagLIF to high currents. The benchmarks range in complexity from focused experiments of linear hydrodynamic instabilities to fully integrated MagLIF fusion experiments. With the latest addition of physics capabilities, FLASH now obtains good agreement with the experimental data, theoretical results, and leading ICF target design simulation code results across all six benchmarks. These results establish confidence in FLASH as a useful tool for designing magnetically driven ICF targets on facilities like Z and Pacific Fusion's upcoming Demonstration System.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theories in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the recent developments in magnetohydrodynamics, which in particular deal with the evolution of magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. We especially emphasize (i) the necessity of renormalizing equations of motion in turbulence where velocity and magnetic fields become H\"older singular; (ii) the breakdown of Laplacian determinism (spontaneous stochasticity) for turbulent magnetic fields; and (iii) the possibility of eliminating the notion of magnetic field lines, using instead magnetic path lines as trajectories of Alfvenic wave-packets. These methodologies are then exemplified with their application to the problem of magnetic reconnection -- rapid change in magnetic field pattern that accelerates plasma -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics and laboratory plasmas. The necessity of smoothing out rough velocity and magnetic fields on a finite scale L implies that magnetohydrodynamic equations should be regarded as effective field theories with running parameters depending upon the scale L.</description>

      <title>Fusion research in a Deuterium-Tritium tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent ITER re-baselining calls for new fusion-relevant research best carried out in a DT-capable tokamak device with similar characteristics. The present paper describes key issues that could be addressed in a Suitably Enhanced DT-capable Tokamak (SET), with tungsten plasma facing components, boronization systems, and 10 MW of ECRH, based on characteristics and knowledgebase of JET. We discuss hardware options, and show that fusion-relevant operational scenarios could be achieved. Notably, development, validation and testing of fusion and nuclear diagnostics, to be used in next generation devices, would require a D-T capable tokamak as described.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Preheat Propagation in MagLIF-like Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preheat and pre-magnetization of the fuel are essential steps in the design of Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) configurations. Typically, the energy of the preheat laser is deposited in a central region of the fuel and propagates outward generating magneto-hydrodynamic structures that impact the fuel mass distribution and magnetic flux compression during the subsequent implosion. We present a theoretical analysis of preheat propagation in a magnetized plasma under conditions typical for MagLIF. The analysis is based on the acoustic time scale for the propagation of pressure disturbances being much shorter than the conductive time scale for heat diffusion. In this regime, the preheat-driven expansion induces the stratification of fuel mass and magnetic field, which accumulate in a dense outer shelf bounded by the leading shock. We derive self-similar solutions of the mathematical model that describe the hydrodynamic profiles of the expansion, and evaluate the evolution of the magnetic field in this configuration. The model is supported by FLASH simulations of preheat propagation. Our analysis shows that the regions where the magnetization of the fuel is significant tend to become localized asymptotically in time at the interface separating the outer shelf from the inner hot core. We assess the implications of this stratification on the magnetic flux conservation and performance of fully integrated MagLIF FLASH simulations.</description>

      <title>Fusion for high-value heat production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global consumption of heat is vast and difficult to decarbonise, but it could present an opportunity for commercial fusion energy technology.
  The economics of supplying heat with fusion energy are explored in context of a future decarbonised energy system. A simple, generalised model is used to estimate the impact of selling heat on profitability, and compare it to selling electricity, for a variety of fusion proposed power plant permutations described in literature.
  Heat production has the potential to significantly improve the financial performance of fusion over selling electricity. Upon entering a highly electrified energy system, fusion should aim to operate as a grid-scale heat pump, avoiding both electrical conversion and recirculation costs whilst exploiting firm demand for high-value heat. This strategy is relatively high-risk, high-reward, but options are identified for hedging these risks. We also identify and discuss new avenues for competition in this domain, which would not exist if fusion supplies electricity only.</description>

      <title>Periodic table for highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions (HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals. While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws ($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Nonlinear Signatures in Solar Wind Proton Density at the L1 Lagrange point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is a medium characterized by strong turbulence and significant field fluctuations on various scales. Recent observations have revealed that magnetic turbulence exhibits a self-similar behavior. Similarly, high-resolution measurements of the proton density have shown comparable characteristics, prompting several studies into the multifractal properties of these density fluctuations. In this work, we show that low-resolution observations of the solar wind proton density over time, recorded by various spacecraft at Lagrange point L1, also exhibit non-linear and multifractal structures. The novelty of our study lies in the fact that this is the first systematic analysis of solar wind proton density using low-resolution (hourly) data collected by multiple spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point over a span of 17 years. Furthermore, we interpret our results within the framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics, which appears to be consistent with the observed nonlinear behavior. Based on the data, we successfully validate the q-triplet predicted by non-extensive statistical theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most rigorous and systematic validation to date of the q-triplet in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>On the edge turbulence in a DTT-like tokamak plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent transport provides the main contribution to particle and energy losses in tokamak plasmas, which control is of paramount importance for forthcoming reactors such as the Divertor-Tokamak-Test (DTT) facility under construction at ENEA Frascati. In this work we investigate the characteristic features of drift turbulence at the plasma edge through 3D electro-static fluid simulations. We outline the crucial role of the diffusion coefficient for the emerging turbulent spectra and for the excitation of vortex structures or zonal flows. Moreover, the impact of adding a poloidal magnetic component is discussed considering also a radial shear, and the emergence of anisotropic spectral features is emphasized. The analysis is extended to the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions along the radial direction, instead of the periodic ones usually employed in such kind of analyses.</description>

Abstract: The Novatron magnetic mirror fusion reactor concept features significant advantages. These include stability against MHD interchange and kinetic DCLC modes, axisymmetry, and minimized radial particle drifts and neoclassical losses. For achieving a ratio Q &gt; 30 of fusion power to heating power, axial particle confinement is uniquely designed to rely on the simultaneous use of three distinct forces; magnetic mirrors, electrostatic potentials, and ponderomotive forces in a tandem-like configuration. Axial confinement physics theory is here analyzed and compared to earlier mirror configurations. Scenarios for D-T, D-D, and catalyzed D-D fusion plasmas are outlined.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze stochasticity in the magnetic fields of magnetic confinement fusion reactors by calculating the lobe areas of turnstiles - a method developed for characterizing transport into and out of resonance zones in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We develop an efficient algorithm based on an action principle to calculate this quantity directly from the magnetic field, including stellarator magnetic fields which are sourced by a complicated set of three-dimensional coils. In the analyzed devices, the turnstile area on the inboard (plasma-facing) manifolds is much smaller than the turnstile area on the outboard (wall-facing) manifolds. The application of the turnstile area calculation for the design of future reactors will be discussed.</description>

      <title>A Runaway Electron Avalanche Surrogate for Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physics-constrained deep learning surrogate that predicts the exponential ``avalanche'' growth rate of runaway electrons (REs) for a plasma containing partially ionized impurities is developed. Specifically, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that learns the adjoint of the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation in steady-state is derived, enabling a rapid surrogate of the RE avalanche for a broad range of plasma parameters, motivating a path towards an ML-accelerated integrated description of a tokamak disruption. A steady-state power balance equation together with atomic physics data is embedded directly into the PINN, thus limiting the PINN to train across physically consistent temperatures and charge state distributions. This restricted training domain enables accurate predictions of the PINN while drastically reducing the computational cost of training the model. In addition, a novel closure for the relativistic electron population used when evaluating the secondary source of REs is developed that enables improved accuracy compared to a Rosenbluth-Putvinski source. The avalanche surrogate is verified against Monte Carlo simulations, where it is shown to accurately predict the RE avalanche growth rate across a broad range of plasma parameters encompassing distinct tokamak disruption scenarios.</description>
