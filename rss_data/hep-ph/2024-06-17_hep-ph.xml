      <title>Axion Stars: Mass Functions and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles, as leading dark matter candidates, can also have interesting implications for dark matter substructures if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. In such a scenario, axion perturbations on small scales will lead to the formation of axion miniclusters at matter-radiation equality, and subsequently the formation of axion stars. Such compact objects open new windows for indirect searches for axions. We compute the axion star mass function based on recent axion minicluster studies and Bose star simulations. Applying this mass function, we find post-inflation axion-like particles with masses $m_a&lt; 3.3 \times 10^{-17}$ eV are constrained by the lack of dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarfs. We also find that current microlensing surveys are insensitive to QCD axion stars. While we focus on the gravitational detectability of axion stars, our result can be directly applied to other interesting signatures of axion stars, e.g. their decay to photons, that require as input the abundance, mass, and density distribution of axion stars.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the doubly-charged vector bilepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model stands as the first established, complete (gravity aside), fundamental theory of nature. In the other hand, it is unable to account for some universal observations -- besides possessing a number of undesirable characteristics. Thus, there is a pressing need for new physics, which, in the high energy realm, usually imply new particles. In this thesis, we delve into one such particle: the doubly-charged vector bilepton. This particle is a singular feature of Beyond the Standard Model theories and its phenomenology is still incipient. We focus, in particular, on its power as a mediator of Charged Lepton Flavour Mediation, a type of process which, in turn, may represent a smoking gun with respect to its discovery or constraining of its parameters. Such processes have not been skeptically explored, and the lepton mixing in their interaction with the $U^{\pm \pm}$ not been properly focused on.
  The first step we take is investigating what bounds an LHC trimuon process may impose on the parameter space of this particle. The results motivate us to look for alternative experimental sources of limits. The seven 3-body lepton decay channels delivered a great prospect, and we perform a detailed, model independent analysis of what they can imply for the $U^{\pm \pm}$ and other two exotic species. Special attention is paid to occurring interferences between new contributions.
  Finally, we proceed to construct a thorough analysis of the evolution of couplings in the Minimal 3-3-1 Model, the main theory incorporating a vector bilepton, examining how it is threatened by Landau poles in its abelian coupling. We explicitly obtain the 1-loop contributions of exotic particles to the runnings, finding that the perturbative regime of the model is in fact considerably larger than conventionally assumed.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electromagnetic and Gravitational Form Factors: Insights from LFHQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficacious approach to derive the generalized parton distributions for the pion and proton, based upon prior knowledge of their respective parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our method leverages on integral representations of the electromagnetic form factors derived from the light-front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) formalism, coupled with PDFs computed from continuum Schwinger functional methods at the hadronic scale. Using these techniques, we calculate gravitational form factors and associated mass distributions for each hadron. Remarkably, our calculations yield results that closely match recent lattice QCD simulations conducted near the physical pion mass. This work not only deepens our understanding of hadronic structure but also highlights the efficacy of the LFHQCD approach in modeling fundamental properties of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators and axion dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <title>Defect Induced Heavy Meson Dynamics in the QCD Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon introducing an heavy quark in the perturbative regime of the QCD conformal window we precisely determine the associated heavy meson spectrum and wave functions in terms of the number of light flavours and mass. We then compute the conformal Isgur-Wise function which is a central quantity in heavy quark physics. We further determine the impact of the residual low energy confining dynamics on the heavy meson spectrum. As a working framework, we adapt the heavy quark effective theory to the perturbative conformal window dynamics. Our work lays the foundations to systematically go beyond the infinite mass defect approximation in conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Analyzing leptonic decays of heavy quarkonia in covariant confined quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leptonic decay widths of heavy quarkonia are complementary observables to the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons and provide additional insight into the possible lepton flavor universality breaking. We analyze the former in the framework of the covariant confined quark model, introducing a novel approach for the description of the radially excited quarkonia states, which is based on constituent quark mass running and the orthogonality of the states. We are able to describe the experimental observations by our approach within the Standard model, which does not support new physics explanations.</description>

      <title>Antenna subtraction for processes with identified particles at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collider processes with identified hadrons in the final state are widely studied in view of determining details of the proton structure and of understanding hadronization. Their theory description requires the introduction of fragmentation functions, which parametrise the transition of a produced parton into the identified hadron. To compute higher-order perturbative corrections to these processes requires a subtraction method for infrared singular configurations. We extend the antenna subtraction method to hadron fragmentation processes in hadronic collisions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD by computing the required fragmentation antenna functions in initial-final kinematics. The integrated antenna functions retain their dependence on the momentum fractions of the incoming and fragmenting partons.</description>

      <title>The gauge coupling evolutions of an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory with the maximally symmetry breaking pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalizable group equations (RGEs) of the extended strong and weak gauge couplings in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory, where three-generational SM fermions are non-trivially embedded. This framework was previously found to generate the observed SM quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern through its maximally breaking pattern. The field theoretical two-loop RGEs can not achieve the gauge coupling unification with the minimal setup, unless additional adjoint Higgs fields as well as the gravity-induced $d=5$ term to the ${\rm SU}(8)$ field strength term are included.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before.</description>

      <title>New strategies for probing $B\to D^\ast \ell\bar\nu_\ell$ lattice and experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the exclusive semileptonic decay $B\to D^\ast \ell\bar\nu_\ell$ based on the Belle and Belle II data made public in 2023, combined with recent lattice-QCD calculations of the hadronic transition form factors by FNAL/MILC, HPQCD and JLQCD. We also consider a new combination of the Belle and Belle II data sets by HFLAV. The analysis is based on the form-factor parameterisation by Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL), using Bayesian and frequentist statistics, for which we discuss novel strategies. We compare the results of an analysis where the BGL parameterisation is fit only to the lattice data with those from a simultaneous fit to lattice and experiment, and discuss the resulting predictions for the CKM-matrix element $V_{cb}$, as well as other phenomenological observables, such as $R^{\tau/\mu}(D^\ast)$. We find tensions when comparing analyses based on different combinations of experimental or theoretical input, requiring the introduction of a systematic error for some of our results.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the chiral Lagrangian coefficients with light vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the coefficients in the effective chiral Lagrangian from QCD, which includes pseudo-scalar mesons and vector mesons (with hidden symmetry), up to O(p4). This encompasses both the normal and anomalous parts. Our work builds on a previous study that derived the chiral Lagrangian from first principles of QCD, where the low-energy coefficients are defined in terms of specific Green's functions in QCD. This research extends our earlier efforts that focused on calculating the low-energy coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian for pure pseudo-scalar mesons. This marks the first calculation of chiral Lagrangian coefficients for vector mesons from QCD, particularly for the important parameters a and g, which are typically considered inputs in existing literature. Notably, the regularization method used previously is inadequate for this broader scope. We find that cut-off regularization yields reasonable results for both pseudo-scalar mesons and vector mesons, though it has certain limitations. Finally, we demonstrate that our method aligns with the Weinberg sum rules.</description>

      <title>A search for leptonic photon Z_l at all three CLIC energy stages by using artificial neural networks (ANN)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the possible dynamics of the massive leptonic photon \(Z_{l}\) are reconsidered via the process \(e^{+}e^{-} \ rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) with updated center of mass energies (\(380\ GeV,\ 1500\ GeV\ and\ 3000\ GeV\)). We show that the new generation colliders as CLIC can observe massive leptophilic vector boson Z_l with mass up to the center of mass energy, provided that leptonic coupling constant is \(g_{l} \geq 10^{- 3}\). In this study, we also estimated the cross-sections by artificial neural networks using the theoretical results we obtained for CLIC. According to the results obtained, it was seen that these predictions could be made through machine learning.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of search strategies for $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge bosons at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model with masses at or below the GeV scale are motivated by searches for dark matter and precision measurements in the quark and lepton flavour sectors, including that of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. An excellent experimental environment to test such light new physics is given by the Belle II experiment, which foresees to take up to 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data. Here we consider a model with an additional gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry that introduces a neutral gauge boson, a Dark Photon, with possibly large couplings to muon- and tau-flavored leptons, including neutrinos. Dark Photon mixing with the Standard Model photon is loop induced, allowing it to couple to electrically charged fermions other than muons and taus. We systematically investigate the possible search strategies for Dark Photons with four fermions final states. We identified search channels with muons as the most promising ones, and we analyse the kinematic distributions to obtain cuts that optimise the sensitivity of Belle II searches for the Dark Photon. Summarising the sensitivities from the most promising search channels we provide a comprehensive overview of future searches at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Cosmos: Dark matter, primordial black holes, and cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$-CDM model of cosmology has done much to clarify our picture of the early universe. However, there are still some questions that $\Lambda$-CDM does not necessarily answer; questions such as what is the fundamental nature of dark matter? What is its origin? And what causes the intriguing measurements that we are seeing from cosmic dawn? In this thesis, I will describe three directions in which I have pushed forward our understanding of how fundamental physics manifests in cosmology. First, I have studied the signatures of exotic energy injection in various astrophysical and cosmological probes, including the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, and the formation of the earliest stars in our universe. Second, I have investigated the formation of primordial black hole dark matter in a general model for inflation with multiple scalar fields. I have identified the space of models that can generate primordial black holes while remaining in compliance with observational constraints using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and also showed that future gravitational wave observatories will be able to further constrain these models. Finally, I have developed an analytic description of signals from 21\,cm cosmology using methods inspired by effective field theory. This method includes realistic observational effects and has been validated against state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations, including those with alternative dark matter scenarios. With these recent efforts, we are advancing the frontiers of dark matter phenomenology and cosmology, thereby paving the way towards illuminating the remaining mysteries of our cosmos and drawing closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>PSALTer: Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the PSALTer software for efficiently computing the mass and energy of the particle spectrum for any (e.g. higher-rank) tensor field theory in the Wolfram Language. The user must provide a Lagrangian density which is expanded quadratically in the fields around a Minkowski vacuum, is linear in the coupling coefficients, and otherwise built from the partial derivative and Minkowski metric. PSALTer automatically computes the spin-projection operators, saturated propagator, bare masses, residues of massive and massless poles and overall unitarity conditions in terms of the coupling coefficients. The constraints on the source currents and total number of gauge symmetries are produced as a by-product. We provide examples from scalar, vector, tensor and gauge theories of gravity. Each example, including spectra of higher-spin modified gravity theories, may be obtained on a personal computer in a matter of minutes. The software is also parallelised for use on high-performance computing resources. The initial release allows for parity-preserving operators constructed from fields of up to rank three: this functionality will be extended in future versions. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>Time dependence of neutrino quantum kinetics in a core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the supernova core is still preliminary, despite its likely relevance to the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism. We present multi-angle and multi-energy numerical simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics within a spherically symmetric shell in the proximity of the region of neutrino decoupling. We rely on inputs from a one-dimensional core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6\ M_\odot$ and find that, at early post-bounce times ($t_{\mathrm pb} \lesssim 0.5$ s), no crossing is present in the angular distribution of the electron neutrino lepton number and flavor conversion develops due to vacuum mixing. Angular crossings appear for $t_{\textrm{pb}} \gtrsim 0.5$ s and fast flavor conversion leads to flavor equipartition, with the spectral energy distribution of $\nu_{e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) and $\nu_{x}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{x}$) becoming comparable. Notably, flavor equipartition is not a generic outcome of fast flavor conversion, but rather a consequence of the relatively similar properties of neutrinos of different flavors characterizing the late accretion phase. Artificially tweaking the collision term to introduce an electron lepton number angular crossing for $t_{\mathrm{pb}} \lesssim 0.05$ s, we observe that flavor equipartition is not achieved. While our findings are restricted to a specific supernova model, they suggest a rich phenomenology of flavor conversion in the supernova core as a function of the post-bounce time which needs to be further explored to assess its impact on the explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Interpolating gauge-fixing for Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in D=3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time is studied in a gauge-fixing scheme which interpolates between the covariant gauge and light-cone gauge, the interpolating gauge-fixing. The ultraviolet finiteness of the theory is proved via the Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) algebraic renormalization procedure, which allows us to demonstrate the vanishing of all $\beta$-functions and all anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effects on the Tachyon Inflation from Thermodynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the Friedmann equations emerging from the entropy-area law of black hole thermodynamics in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle, we study tachyon inflation in the early universe. The presence of a minimal length modifies the Friedmann equations and hence the slow-roll and perturbation parameters in the tachyon model. These modifications, though small, affect the viability of the tachyon inflation in confrontation with observational data. We compare the numerical results of the model with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BAO+BK14(18) data and Planck2018 TT, TE,EE +lowE+lensing+BK14(18) +BAO+LIGO $\&amp;$ Virgo2016 data at $68\%$ and $95\%$ CL. We show that while the tachyon inflation with power-law, inverse power-law and inverse exponential potentials is not observationally viable in comparison with the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence levels of the new joint data, in the presence of the minimal length the model becomes observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Charmoniumlike Channels $1^{+}$ with Isospin $1$ from Lattice and Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many exotic charmoniumlike mesons have already been discovered experimentally, of which the $Z_c$ mesons with isospin 1 are prominent examples. We investigate $J^{PC}=1^{+\pm}$ states with flavor $\bar cc \bar qq$ ($q=u,d$) in isospin 1 using lattice QCD. This is the first study of these mesons employing more than one volume and involving frames with nonzero total momentum. We utilize two $N_f=2+1$ CLS ensembles with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280\,$MeV. As the simulations are performed with unphysical quark masses and at a single lattice spacing of $a=0.086\,$fm, our results provide only qualitative insights. Resulting eigenenergies are compatible or just slightly shifted down with respect to noninteracting energies, where the most significant shifts occur for certain $D\bar D^*$ states. Both channels $1^{+\pm}$ have a virtual pole slightly below the threshold if $D\bar D^*$ is assumed to be decoupled from other channels. In addition, we perform a coupled channel analysis of $J/\psi \pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ scattering with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ within an effective field theory framework. The $J/\psi \pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ invariant-mass distributions from BESIII and finite-volume energies from several lattice QCD simulations, including this work, are fitted simultaneously. All fits yield two poles relatively close to the $D\bar D^*$ threshold and reasonably reproduce the experimental $Z_c$ peaks. They also reproduce lattice energies up to slightly above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold, while reproduction at even higher energies is better for fits that put more weight on the lattice data. Our findings suggest that the employed effective field theory can reasonably reconcile the peaks in the experimental line shapes and the lattice energies, although those lie close to noninteracting energies. We also study $J/\psi \pi$ scattering in s-wave and place upper bounds on the phase shift.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen--Kaplan--Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics at the BH horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find that the spin tends to increase the damping time of the fundamental mode for reflective ultracompact objects. We also find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes, and that the spin enhances the deviations from the black hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. We thus show that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($\nu_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $\nu_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>The quantumness of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube collaboration observed a neutrino excess in the direction of NGC 1068 with high statistical significance. This constitutes the second detection of an astrophysical neutrino point source after the discovery of a variable emission originating from the blazar TXS~0506+056. Neutrinos emitted by these sources traverse huge, well-determined distances on their way to Earth. This makes them a promising tool to test new physics in the neutrino sector. We consider secret interactions with the cosmic neutrino background and discuss their impact on the flux of neutrino point sources. The observation of emission from NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 can then be used to put limits on the strength of the interaction. We find that our ignorance of the absolute neutrino masses has a strong impact and, therefore, we present limits in two benchmark scenarios with the sum of the neutrino masses around their lower and upper limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the mixing phenomenon of a neutral meson formed by a fictitious massive quark will disappear, if the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale. This disappearance is taken as the high-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the width difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the dispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then connects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark masses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is demonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$ and $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured values. In particular, the known numerical relation $V_{us}\approx \sqrt{m_s/m_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m_s$ ($m_b$) can be derived analytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing of the $\mu^- e^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with intermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate spectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements. The lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of the inequality $m_2^2/m_3^2\gg m_s^2/m_b^2$, $m_{2,3}$ being the neutrino masses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\tau^-e^+$-$\tau^+e^-$ mixing specifies the mixing angle $\theta_{23}\approx 45^\circ$. Our work suggests that the fermion masses and mixing parameters are constrained dynamically, and the neutrino mass orderings can be discriminated by the internal consistency of the SM.</description>

Abstract: Cosmologies in which dark matter clumps strongly on small scales are unfavorable to terrestrial detectors that are as yet unexposed to the clumps. I show that sub-hectometer clumps could trigger thermonuclear runaways by scattering on nuclei in white dwarf cores (carbon and oxygen) and neutron star oceans (carbon), setting off Type Ia-like supernovae and x-ray superbursts respectively. I consider two scenarios: ``dark clusters" that are essentially microhalos, and ``long-range dark nuggets", essentially macroscopic composites, with long-range Yukawa baryonic interactions that source the energy for igniting explosions. I constrain dark clusters weighing between the Planck mass and asteroid masses, and long-range dark nuggets over a wider mass range spanning forty orders of magnitude. These limits greatly complement searches I had co-proposed in 2109.04582 for scattering interactions of dark clumps in neutron stars, cosmic rays, and pre-historic minerals.</description>

Abstract: Critical phenomena emerging from the critical end point of a first-order transition are ubiquitous in nature. Here we bring the concept of a supercritical crossover, the Widom line, initially developed in the context of fluids, into the interacting matter described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We show that the existence of the putative critical end point between hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma in the temperature versus chemical potential of the QCD phase diagram implies the existence of a Widom line emerging from it in the supercritical region. We survey the thermodynamic anomalies already identified in simplified theoretical models of QCD exhibiting a critical end point, to show that they can be interpreted in terms of a Widom line. Then we suggest possible directions where the Widom line concept could provide new light on the QCD phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: We analyse a model that connects the neutrino sector and the dark sector of the universe via a mediator $\Phi$, stabilised by a discrete $Z_4$ symmetry that breaks to a remnant $Z_2$ upon $\Phi$ acquiring a non-zero vacuum expectation value ($v_\phi$). The model accounts for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via additional contributions to the canonical Type-I leptogenesis. The $Z_4$ symmetry breaking scale ($v_\phi$) in the model not only establishes a connection between the neutrino sector and the dark sector, but could also lead to gravitational wave signals that are within the reach of current and future experimental sensitivities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the dominant QED correction to the neutrino-electron interaction rate in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling in the early universe, and estimate its impact on the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ in cosmic microwave background anisotropy observations. We find that the correction to the interaction rate is at the sub-percent level, consistent with a recent estimate by Jackson and Laine. Relative to that work we include the electron mass in our computations, but restrict our analysis to the enhanced $t$-channel contributions. The fractional change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ due to the rate correction is of order $10^{-5}$ or below, i.e., about a factor of 30 smaller than that recently claimed by Cielo {\it et al.}, and below the nominal computational uncertainties of the current benchmark value of $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM} = 3.0440 \pm 0.0002$. We therefore conclude that aforementioned number remains to be the state-of-the-art benchmark for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ in the standard model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the equilibration rate of a nearly homogeneous Higgs field, displaced from its ground state during the onset of an electroweak phase transition. The computation is carried out with Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory, and a significant part of the result originates from Bose-enhanced $t$-channel $2\leftrightarrow 2$ scatterings. The expression is shown to be IR finite and gauge independent. Possible applications to Langevin simulations of bubble nucleation are mentioned, and we also contrast with the friction affecting bubble growth.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and light-front energy distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central nucleus--nucleus as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the form factors of $B_c\rightarrow\eta_c$, $J/\psi$ and corresponding weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The form factors of $B_c\rightarrow\eta_c$ and $B_c\rightarrow J/\psi$ are analyzed in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In these analyses, the contributions of the vacuum condensate terms $\langle g_{s}^{2}GG\rangle$ and $\langle g_{s}^{3}GGGf\rangle$ are considered. In addition, the decay widths and branching ratios of several decay channels are obtained by using the calculated form factors. These decay processes include the nonleptonic decays of $B_c^- \to \eta_c \pi^-$, $\eta_c K^-$, $\eta_c \rho^-$, $\eta_c K^{*-}$, $B_c^- \to J/\psi \pi^-$, $J/\psi K^-$, $J/\psi \rho^-$, $J/\psi K^{*-}$, and the semileptonic decays of $B_c^- \to \eta_c \mathcal{l} \bar{\nu}$, $B_c^- \to J/\psi \mathcal{l} \bar{\nu}$. These results about the form factors and decay properties of $B_c$ meson provide useful information for us to study the heavy-quark dynamics and find new physics(NP) beyond Standard Model(SM).</description>

Abstract: We present comparisons to experimental data along with predictions of observables for U+U collisions at 193 GeV using a multistage theoretical and computational framework consisting of boost-invariant IP-Glasma initial state, MUSIC hydrodynamics, and a hadronic transport cascade generated by iS3D \&amp; SMASH. Our results show great agreement with existing anisotropic flow measurements from RHIC [ arXiv:1505.07812 ; arXiv:1901.08155 ] . We provide predictions for differential flow observables as well as multiparticle correlations and transverse-momentum-flow correlations. When possible, we compare our predictions to results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV to properly outline the effects of deformation in the initial state on final state observables.</description>

      <title>Modeling the core-halo mass relation in FDM halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an intriguing candidate alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM). The FDM model predicts that dark halos have characteristic core structures generated by the effect of quantum pressure, which is different from the structure of CDM halos. We devise a semi-analytic model of a FDM halo density profile by assuming that the density distribution results from the redistribution of mass in a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We calculate the mass redistribution radius by considering dynamical relaxation within the FDM halo. We adopt a concentration-halo mass relation with lower concentration compared to that in the CDM model below the half mode mass, which originates from the suppressed matter density fluctuations at small length scales. Our model reproduces the core-halo mass relation (CHMR) found in the numerical simulation of \citet{2014NatPh..10..496S} at $z&lt;1$. We show that the CHMR is well described by a double power law, unlike previous studies that approximate it by a single power law. Our model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the largest FDM simulation of \citet{2021MNRAS.506.2603M} at $z=3$. We find that the core mass for a given halo mass follows the log-normal distribution, both in our model and in the simulation results for the first time, and quantitatively compare the variance of the distribution among them. Although our model does not fully explain the scatter of the CHMR, we show the scatter of the concentration-halo mass relation sizably contributes to them.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Momentum Broadening in a Non-Abelian Plasma away from Thermal Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform classical-statistical real-time lattice simulations to compute real-time spectral functions and momentum broadening of quarks in the presence of strongly populated non-Abelian gauge fields. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, we find that the momentum distribution of quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features as a function of time due to correlated momentum kicks it receives from the medium, eventually going over to a diffusive regime. We extract the momentum diffusion coefficient for a mass range describing charm and bottom quarks and find sizeable discrepancies from the heavy quark limit.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional models of core-collapse supernova explosions assisted by heavy sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae can be a copious source of sterile neutrinos, hypothetical particles that mix with active neutrinos. We develop two-dimensional stellar core-collapse models that incorporate the mixing between tau neutrinos and heavy sterile neutrinos -- those with the mass of 150--200 MeV -- to investigate signatures of sterile neutrinos in supernova observables. We find that the decay channel of a sterile neutrino into a pion and a tau neutrino can enhance the explosion energy and the synthesized nickel mass. Although the inclusion of sterile neutrinos considered in this study slightly reduce the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals, we find that they are still detectable for a Galactic event. Furthermore, we point out that if sterile neutrinos are as massive as ~200 MeV, they produce high-energy tau antineutrinos with energies of ~80 MeV, the detection of which can be a smoking signature of the sterile neutrinos and where Hyper-Kamiokande should play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk and shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity by using the Novikov-Thorne model. The results reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increase, the energy flux, radiation temperature, spectra luminosity, and radiative efficiency of the disk all increases. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant \frac{r_2}{M}\leqslant0.4$, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole. We also investigated the Kerr-Sen black hole shadow in a uniform plasma environment. For a fixed inclination angle of $\theta_0=90^\circ$, $\frac{r_2}{M} = \frac{a}{M} = 0.5$, the shadow increase as the homogeneous plasma parameter $k$ increase. Conversely, when $k = 0.1$ and $\frac{a}{M} = 0.5$, an increase in $r_2$ leads to a decrease in the shadow. Furthermore, by using observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we compared the theoretical and observed shadow diameters to constrain the range of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Handling correlated systematic uncertainties on the CKM angle gamma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current precision on the CKM angle $\gamma$ is driven by averages of measurements from multiple final states and multiple experiments. As the next generation of experiments targets a total experimental precision on $\gamma$ less than one degree, systematic uncertainties must be well-controlled and correlated uncertainties between different final states and across experiments must be fully understood. These proceedings examine the systematic uncertainties that arise in direct measurements of $\gamma$ and discuss the potential of each class of systematic uncertainties to prevent sub-degree precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>
