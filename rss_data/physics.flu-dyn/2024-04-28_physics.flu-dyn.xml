      <title>Influence of freestream turbulence and porosity on porous disc-generated wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the effect of freestream turbulence (FST) on wakes produced by discs with different porosity. The wakes are exposed to various freestream turbulence "flavours", where turbulence intensity and integral length scale are independently varied. The turbulent wakes are interrogated through hot-wire anemometry from 3 to 15 diameters downstream of the discs. It is found that discs with low porosity behave similarly to a solid body, both in terms of entrainment behaviour and scaling laws for the centreline mean velocity evolution. Far from the discs, the presence of FST reduces both the wake growth rate and entrainment rate, with a clear effect of both turbulence intensity and integral length scale. As porosity increases, these "solid body" FST effects gradually diminish and are reversed above a critical porosity. The entrainment behaviour in disc-generated wakes is significantly influenced by the presence of large scale coherent-structures, which act as a shield between the wake and the surrounding flow, thus impeding mixing. We found that higher porosity, turbulence intensity, or integral length scale weaken the energy content of these structures, thereby limiting their influence on wake development to a shorter distance downstream of the disc. This, in turn, potentially reduces the influence of large-scale engulfment to the overall entrainment mechanism to a shorter distance downstream of the discs as well. For low porosity discs, freestream turbulence intensity initially promotes near wake growth through the suppression of large-scale structures; however, further downstream, the wakes grow faster when the background is non turbulent.</description>

      <title>On Modeling Tear Breakup Dynamics with a Nematic Lipid Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main roles of the lipid layer (LL) of the tear film (TF) is to help prevent evaporation of the aqueous layer (AL). The LL thickness, composition, and structure all contribute to its barrier function. It is believed that the lipid layer is primarily nonpolar with a layer of polar lipids at the LL/AL interface. There is evidence that the nonpolar region of the LL may have liquid crystalline characteristics. We investigate the structure and function of the LL via a model of the tear film with two layers, using extensional flow of a nematic liquid crystal for the LL and shear-dominated flow of a Newtonian AL. Evaporation is taken into account, and is affected by the LL thickness, internal arrangement of its rod-like molecules, and external conditions. We conduct a detailed parameter study with a focus on the evaporative resistance parameter, the Marangoni number, and primary liquid crystal parameters including the Leslie viscosities and director angle. This new model responds similarly to previous Newtonian models in some respects; however, incorporating internal structure via the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules affects both evaporation and flow. As a result, we see new effects on TF dynamics and breakup.</description>

      <title>Reversal of particle Migration for viscoelastic solution at high solvent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imbalance of normal stress around a particle induces its transverse migration in pressure-driven viscoelastic flow, offering possibilities for particle manipulation in microfluidic devices. Theoretical predictions align with experimental evidence of particles migrating towards the center-line of the flow. However, these arguments have been challenged by both experimental and numerical investigations, revealing the potential for a reversal in the direction of migration for viscoelastic shear-thinning fluids. Yet, a significant property of viscoelastic liquids that remains largely unexplored is the ratio of solvent viscosity to the sum of solvent and polymer viscosities, denoted as $\beta$. We computed the lift coefficients of a freely flowing cylinder in a bi-dimensional Poiseuille flow with Oldroyd-B constitutive equations. A transition from a negative (center-line migration) to a positive (wall migration) lift coefficient was demonstrated with increasing $\beta$ values. Analogous to inertial lift, the changes in the sign of the lift coefficient were strongly correlated with abrupt (albeit small) variations in the rotation velocity of the particle. We established a scaling law for the lift coefficient that is proportional, as expected, to the Weissenberg number, but also to the difference in rotation velocity between the viscoelastic and Newtonian cases. If the particle rotates more rapidly than in the Newtonian case, it migrates towards the wall; conversely, if the particle rotates more slowly than in the Newtonian case, it migrates towards the center-line of the channel. Finally, experiments in microfluidic slits confirmed migration towards the wall for viscoelastic fluids with high viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Parametric and inverse analysis of flow inside an obstructed channel under the influence of magnetic field using physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, fluid flow inside of an obstructed channel under the influence of magnetic field has been analyzed using physics informed neural networks(PINNs). Governing equations have been utilized in low-order form and the solution has been obtained in dimensionless form. Geometric and physics-related dimensionless parameters have been used as input variables of the neural network in the learning process. The radius and longitudinal position of the obstruction have also been involved in the learning process and the problem has been solved parametrically. In the successive sections of the study, inverse problem has been a matter of interest, particularly in form of obtaining the Hartmann number using the proposed method. The results have indicated that the employed method determined the Hartmann number with great accuracy and entailed proper results. In this study a thorough exploration of effects of physical and geometric parameters on the magnetically influenced flow through a duct has been carried out. The accuracy of the results obtained from the solving method proposed have been compared to results generated by common methods used in computational fluid mechanics. The parametric solution of the problem can serve as a powerful tool in optimization problems. The method was also applicable to cases where the parameters were outside of defined range, indicating it's generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Influence of ammonia-water fog formation on ammonia dispersion from a liquid spill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia is expected to play an important role in the green transition, both as a hydrogen carrier and a zero-emission fuel. The use of refrigerated ammonia is attractive due to its relatively high volumetric energy density and increased safety compared to pressurized solutions. Ammonia is highly toxic, and with new applications and increased global demand come stricter requirements for safe handling. Cold gaseous ammonia following a spill of refrigerated ammonia will in contact with humid air cause fog formation. In an environment rich in ammonia, these droplets will due to ammonia's strong hygroscopicity consist of considerable amounts of liquid ammonia as well as water. Fog formation affects the ammonia-air density and thus influences the dispersion dynamics, with a potentially significant impact on hazardous zones. In this work, we present a CFD model including an ammonia-water fog formation model based on accurate thermodynamics. This includes modeling the vapor-liquid equilibrium and accounting for the exothermic mixing of ammonia and water. We apply this CFD model to relevant cases and demonstrate the significant impact of the fog. We analyze the effect of varying relative humidity, fog visibility, influence of wind, and pool evaporation rate. Finally, we model the experimental Red Squirrel test 1F.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis for bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-driven bubble dynamics is a major topic of current research in fluid dynamics, driven by innovative medical therapies, sonochemistry, material treatments, and geophysical exploration. First proposed in 1942, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis provides a simple means to close the equations that govern pressure-driven bubble dynamics as well as the resulting flow field and acoustic emissions in spherical symmetry. The models derived from the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can be solved using standard numerical integration methods at a fraction of the computational cost required for fully resolved simulations. Here, the theoretical foundation of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and contemporary models derived from it are gathered and reviewed, as well as generalized to account for spherically symmetric, cylindrically symmetric, and planar one-dimensional domains. In addition, the underpinning assumptions are clarified and new results that scrutinize the predictive capabilities of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis with respect to the complex acoustic impedance experienced by curved acoustic waves and the formation of shock waves are presented. Although the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is built upon simplifying assumptions and lacks some basic acoustic properties, models derived from it are able to provide accurate predictions under the specific conditions associated with pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions.</description>

      <title>Hindered settling of log-normally distributed particulate suspensions: theoretical models vs. Stokesian simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Settling velocity statistics for dilute, non-Brownian suspensions of polydisperse spheres having a log-normal size distribution are analysed by Stokesian Dynamics, as a function of the total volume fraction and width of the size distribution. Several hundred instantaneous configurations are averaged to obtain reliable statistics. Average velocities for each particle class are compared to the models proposed by Batchelor, Richardson &amp; Zaki, Davis &amp; Gecol, and Masliyah-Lockett-Bassoon (MLB). Batchelor's model is shown to give reasonably accurate predictions when the volume fraction is within 5%. Because of its complexity, this model is however hardly used in practice, so lower-order models are needed. We found that while the other hindered settling models can give reasonably accurate predictions of the velocity of the largest particles, all of them overestimate - in certain cases by a large margin - the velocity of the smaller particles. By computing the fluid-particle velocity slip for each particle class and using Batchelor's model, we explain why predicting the lower tail of the particle size distribution is challenging, and propose possible avenues for model improvement. The analysis of velocity fluctuations suggest quantitative similarities between velocity fluctuations in monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions.</description>

      <title>Onset of global instability in a premixed annular V-flame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate self-excited axisymmetric oscillations of a lean premixed methane--air V-flame in a laminar annular jet. The flame is anchored near the rim of the centrebody, forming an inverted cone, while the strongest vorticity is concentrated along the outer shear layer of the annular jet. Consequently, the reaction and vorticity dynamics are largely separated, except where they coalesce near the flame tip. The global eigenmodes corresponding to the linearised reacting flow equations around the steady base state are computed in an axisymmetric setting. We identify an arc branch of eigenmodes exhibiting strong oscillations at the flame tip. The associated eigenvalues are robust with respect to domain truncation and numerical discretisation, and they become destabilised as the Reynolds number increases. The frequency of the leading eigenmode is found to correspond to the Lagrangian disturbance advection time from the nozzle outlet to the flame tip. This linear result suggests a non-local feedback mechanism consistent with the scenario of `intrinsic thermoacoustic instability'. Nonlinear time-resolved simulation further reveals notable hysteresis phenomena in the subcritical regime prior to instability. Hence, even when the flame is linearly stable, perturbations of sufficient amplitude can trigger limit-cycle oscillations and higher-dimensional dynamics sustained by nonlinear feedback. Notably, linear analysis of the subcritical time-averaged limit-cycle state yields eigenvalues that do not match the nonlinear periodic oscillation frequencies, emphasising the essential role of nonlinear harmonic interactions in the system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Developed and quasi-developed macro-scale heat transfer in micro- and mini-channels with arrays of offset strip fins subject to a uniform heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine to what degree the heat transfer can be described as developed on a macro-scale level in typical micro- and mini-channels with offset strip fin arrays subject to a uniform heat flux, considering flow entrance and side-wall effects. Full-scale numerical heat transfer simulations are conducted to determine the extent of the developed macro-scale heat transfer region within the arrays. We find that the onset point of developed heat transfer increases linearly with the P\'eclet number and channel width. However, the thermal development lengths remain limited relative to the overall channel length. Therefore, the local macro-scale heat transfer coefficient can be modeled by developed Nusselt number correlations with discrepancies below 25% in both the developed and developing heat transfer regions. We observe that quasi-developed heat transfer prevails over nearly the entire entrance region of the channel and significantly contributes to the main heat transfer characteristics, particularly the eigenvalues and amplitudes of the dominant temperature modes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of channel side walls on the temperature field's periodicity and the macro-scale temperature profile, which we characterize through an effective heat transfer coefficient. Our comprehensive numerical data covers various fin height-to-length ratios up to 1, fin pitch-to-length ratios up to 0.5, and channel aspect ratios ranging from 1/5 to 1/17, encompassing Reynolds numbers from 28 to 1224. Two sets of Prandtl number and thermal conductivity ratio are investigated, corresponding to the combinations of copper/air, and copper/water.</description>

      <title>Vaporization dynamics of a super-heated water-in-oil droplet: modeling and numerical solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of vapor bubble growth following droplet vaporization in a superheated liquid involves research areas such as hydrodynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer, and thermodynamics. The interplay between these multiscale aspects is strongly dependent on the geometry, the thermodynamic response, and the local physical properties of the system. To understand the role of each aspect of this complex mechanism we model super-heated droplet vaporization by coupling the equation of motion for bubble growth with the thermodynamics of phase change and heat transfer through the convection-diffusion equation. The semi-analytical model is validated with the analytical description for vapor bubble growth dominated either by inertia (Rayleigh) or by thermal diffusion (Plesset-Zwick), depending on droplet radius and degree of superheat. The effect of a mismatch of the thermal properties between the host liquid and the droplet is shown to be relevant only for low superheating, above which an increase in thermal diffusivity leads to a reduction in the rate of vaporization. At medium to high superheating, the droplet vaporizes completely without relying on thermal diffusion. At the point of complete vaporization, the potential energy within the system drives the bubble overshoots, which vary based on the droplet size and degree of superheat.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Wake Interference Effects on Flapping Dynamics of Elastic Inverted Foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using high-fidelity simulations, we study the self-induced flapping dynamics of an inverted elastic foil when it is placed in tandem with a stationary circular cylinder. The effect of wake interference on the inverted foil's coupled dynamics is examined at a fixed Reynolds number ($Re$) as a function of non-dimensional bending rigidity ($K_{B}$) and the structure to fluid mass ratio ($m^{*}$). Our results show that there exists a critical $K_{B, Cr} = 0.25$, above which the downstream foil is synchronized with the unsteady wake, and the cylinder controls the flapping response and the wake vortex dynamics. During synchronization, two additional flapping modes namely, small and moderate amplitude flapping mode are observed as a function of decreasing $K_{B}$. Below $K_{B, Cr}$, the downstream foil undergoes self-induced large-amplitude flapping (LAF) similar to an isolated foil counterpart. When the dynamics of the downstream foil are analyzed for a range of $m^{*}$, we can characterize the response dynamics into two regions, namely low and high sensitivity. The high sensitivity region is observed when the dynamics are controlled by the cylinder oscillations, i.e., for foils with high stiffness. In this regime, the foil dynamics negatively correlate to $K_{B}$ and $m^{*}$. The low sensitivity region is observed when the downstream foil is no longer synchronized with the wake and undergoes an LAF response, with dynamics that are weakly correlated to $K_{B}$. A new non-dimensional parameter is proposed that combines the effect of the foil's inertia and elastic forces and can capture the foil's response when it is subjected to wake interference effects. The findings from this study aim to generalize our understanding of the self-induced flapping dynamics of inverted foils in an array configuration and have relevance to the development of inverted foil-based renewable energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>Flow rate-pressure drop relations for shear-thinning fluids in deformable configurations: theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an experimental framework to measure the flow rate--pressure drop relation for Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids in two common deformable configurations: (\textit{i}) a rectangular channel and (\textit{ii}) an axisymmetric tube. Using the Carreau model to describe the shear-dependent viscosity, we identify the key dimensionless rheological number, $Cu$, which characterizes shear thinning, and we show that our experiments lie within the power-law regime of shear rates. To rationalize the experimental data, we derive the flow rate-pressure drop relation taking into account the two-way-coupled fluid-structure interaction between the flow and its compliant confining boundaries. We thus identify the second key dimensionless number, $\alpha$, which characterizes the compliance of the conduit. We then compare the theoretical flow rate-pressure drop relation to our experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement between the two. We further contrast our results for shear-thinning and Newtonian fluids to highlight the influence of $Cu$ on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. Finally, we delineate four distinct physical regimes of flow and deformation by mapping our experimental flow rate-pressure drop data for Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids into a $Cu-\alpha$ plane.</description>

Abstract: Resolvent analysis is a powerful tool that can reveal the linear amplification mechanisms between the forcing inputs and the response outputs about a base flow. These mechanisms can be revealed in terms of a pair of forcing and response modes and the associated gains (amplification magnitude) in the order of energy contents at a given frequency. The linear relationship that ties the forcing and the response is represented through the resolvent operator (transfer function), which is constructed through spatially discretizing the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. One of the unique strengths of resolvent analysis is its ability to analyze statistically stationary turbulent flows. In light of the increasing interest in using resolvent analysis to study a variety of flows, we offer this guide in hopes of removing the hurdle for students and researchers to initiate the development of a resolvent analysis code and its applications to their problems of interest. To achieve this goal, we discuss various aspects of resolvent analysis and its role in identifying dominant flow structures about the base flow. The discussion in this paper revolves around the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the most general manner. We cover essential considerations ranging from selecting the base flow and appropriate energy norms to the intricacies of constructing the linear operator and performing eigenvalue and singular value decompositions. Throughout the paper, we offer details and know-how that may not be available to readers in a collective manner elsewhere. Towards the end of this paper, examples are offered to demonstrate the practical applicability of resolvent analysis, aiming to guide readers through its implementation and inspire further extensions. We invite readers to consider resolvent analysis as a companion for their research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Layer separation of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an unconditional $L^2$ upper bound for the boundary layer separation of Leray-Hopf solutions in a smooth bounded domain. By layer separation, we mean the discrepancy between a (turbulent) low-viscosity Leray-Hopf solution $u^\nu$ and a fixed (laminar) regular Euler solution $\bar u$ with similar initial conditions and body force. We show an asymptotic upper bound $C \|\bar u\|_{L^\infty}^3 T$ on the layer separation, anomalous dissipation, and the work done by friction. This extends the previous result when the Euler solution is a regular shear in a finite channel. The key estimate is to control the boundary vorticity in a way that does not degenerate in the vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that in MHD (unlike in hydrodynamics) linear stability does not guarantee nonlinear stability, even in this simple case. We show that the minimum-energy configurations attainable by metastable equilibria under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be determined by solving a combinatorial optimization problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by simulations of destabilized metastable equilibria where turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. For the case of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximization of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of stellar systems and collisionless plasmas and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Arterial Blood Flow Simulations through Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a computational approach leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the efficient computation of arterial blood flows, particularly focusing on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by using the domain decomposition technique. Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately. This study contributes to the integration of deep learning methodologies with fluid mechanics, paving the way for accurate and efficient high-fidelity simulations in biomedical applications, particularly in modeling arterial blood flow.</description>

      <title>A Test Problem for Flow Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The test problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved, and it requires evaluation of derivatives of the solution and pressure on the curved boundary. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior.</description>
