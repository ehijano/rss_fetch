      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional "unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement with the aforementioned predictions.</description>

      <title>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>Engineering and Revealing Dirac Strings in Spinor Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has been no systematic study of the singular vector potentials associated with the monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of freedom, and the artificial gauge, and show that there exists a mapping between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also leads to a new way of constructing spherical Landau levels, and monopole harmonics. Our observation provides insights into the behavior of quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>
