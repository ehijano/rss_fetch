      <title>The Distribution of Vaccine among Countries in the Case of a Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Only few companies were able to produce vaccine again COVID-19. Thus, one producer supplied it to many countries. The distribution was not effective. Some countries overstocked the vaccine while other countries were not able to buy enough. The purpose of the present paper is to provide with a frame such that one producer distributes the vaccine to a set of countries in a way that the shortage is minimized. Methodology: The consumption of the countries are approximated by regression functions taking into account the saturation of the process. The distribution of the vaccine is determined by MIP models of operations research. Findings: Effective distribution of vaccine can be obtained for even a large number of countries. Both the level of the shortage and the number of the consecutive shortage days in a country can be controlled. Practical implications: A group of countries can act as a single partner of a pharmaceutical company. They can get a steady supply. The company gets a well-organized delivery plan. Social implications: More people can be saved because of the steady supply of the vaccine. Originality: The paper develops a new concept for the fair distribution of vaccines between countries. This concept and the method derived from it can be applied in the event of future pandemics on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Physical and geographic analysis of the urban cooling potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of a number of urban cooling techniques has been thoroughly studied by the scientific community. However, decision-makers lack the tools to spatialize their deployment as part of their urban cooling and climate change adaptation strategies. Among other indicators, a spatial assessment of the cooling potential for a technique in a given area is lacking. To this end, we analyze the physical mechanisms on which these techniques are based and identify corresponding geographical indicators that influence their cooling performance. Solar irradiance, existing material properties and underground infrastructure stand out as essential indicators for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Aircrew rostering workload patterns and associated fatigue and sleepiness scores in short/medium haul flights under RBAC 117 rules in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationships between workload and fatigue or sleepiness are investigated through the analysis of rosters and responses to questionnaires from Brazilian aircrews, taken from Fadig\^ometro database. The approach includes temporal markers - coinciding with Samn-Perelli (SP) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) responses - where SAFTE-FAST model outcomes are calculated. The model results follow the increase of fatigue and sleepiness perceptions during the dawn (0h00 to 05h59), but underestimate the self-rated scores during the evening (18h00 to 23h59). On the other hand, the KSS scores fit the relative risk of pilot errors, representing a reasonable proxy for risk assessment. Linear relationships obtained between workload metrics, computed within 168-hours prior to the responses, and self-rated SP and KSS scores provide a consistent method to estimate accumulated fatigue and sleepiness. Considering 7149 rosters of 2023, the duty time ($DT$), the number of flight sectors ($N_{CREW}$) and the sum of flight sectors with sit periods longer than one hour ($N_{CREW}+N_{SIT}$) are associated with 70.1%/60.6% of the highest predicted scores of SP/KSS. Applying the mitigations $DT\leq44h$, $N_{CREW}\leq15$ and $N_{CREW}+N_{SIT}\leq19$ for every 168-hour interval yields a significant decrease in the higher values of SP/KSS with minimal impact on aircrew productivity.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Safety and Traffic Operations Around Near-Side Versus Far-Side Transit Stops: Emerging Observational Evidence from Utah</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research project's objective was to investigate the impacts of transit stop location (near-side versus far-side) on pedestrian safety and traffic operations. Three different video-based behavioral observation data collections at signalized intersections in Utah were utilized, studying: (1) transit vehicle stop events and transit rider crossing behaviors and vehicle conflicts; (2) pedestrian conflicts with right-turning vehicles (driver/pedestrian reactions, conflict severity); and (3) pedestrian crossing behaviors (crossing location, crossing behaviors). These outcomes were statistically compared for near-side versus far-side transit stop locations. Far-side transit stops appear better for general traffic operations. Although transit departure delays are more likely and impactful at far-side stops, actions can be taken to improve transit operations there. On the other hand, far-side transit stops appear to be worse for pedestrian safety, corroborating prior crash-based research findings. Specifically, conflicts at far-side stops were more severe, and drivers were less likely to slow or stop for pedestrians. Reconciling these differing findings likely requires improving pedestrian safety at some far-side transit stops, and prioritizing safety over operational efficiency at other near-side transit stops.</description>

      <title>Why Honor Heroes? Praise as a Social Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heroes are people who perform costly altruistic acts. Few people turn out to be heroes, but most people spontaneously honor heroes overtly by commenting, applauding, or enthusiastically celebrating their deeds. This behavior seems odd from an individual fitness optimization perspective. The best strategy should be to rely on others to invest time and effort in celebrations. To explain the universal propensity to pay tribute, we propose that public admiration is a way for admirers to signal that they are committed to the same values as the hero. We show that the emergence of heroic acts is an expected side-effect of this propensity.</description>

      <title>Estimation of marine fishing capacity of China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using PTP and DEA methods, the study of marine fishing capacity in China revealed that it's more accurate to consider the input index as total power rather than the number of ships. The analysis clarified that the main issue with marine fishing capacity in China is the excess total power of fishing ships. The study suggested reducing the number of ships by 35.2%, the gross tonnage by 29.8%, and the total power by 37.3% to align with the catch levels of 1999. It also proposed the idea of supplementing peak years. The PTP methodology was found to be suitable for longitudinal analysis over time, while the DEA approach is better for comparing fishing capacity across different regions at the same time. Additionally, the study indicated that practical fishing capacity tends to be underestimated, so actual reductions in capacity are usually larger than calculated values.</description>

      <title>Why Do Experts Favor Solar and Wind as Renewable Energies Despite their Intermittency?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humanity accelerates its shift to renewable energy generation, people who are not experts in renewable energy are learning about energy technologies and the energy market, which are complex. The answers to some questions will be obvious to expert practitioners but not to non-experts. One such question is Why solar and wind generation are expected to supply the bulk of future energy when they are intermittent. We learn here that once the baseline hurdles of scalability to utility scale and the underlying resources being widely available globally are satisfied, the forecasted cost of solar and wind is 2-4X lower than competing technologies, even those that are not as scalable and available. The market views intermittency as surmountable.</description>

      <title>Key motifs searching in complex dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key network motifs searching in complex networks is one of the crucial aspects of network analysis. There has been a series of insightful findings and valuable applications for various scenarios through the analysis of network structures. However, in dynamic systems, slight changes in the choice of dynamic equations and parameters can alter the significance of motifs. The known methods are insufficient to address this issue effectively. In this paper, we introduce a concept of perturbation energy based on the system's Jacobian matrix, and define motif centrality for dynamic systems by seamlessly integrating network topology with dynamic equations. Through simulations, we observe that the key motifs obtained by the proposed energy method present better effective and accurate than them by integrating network topology methods, without significantly increasing algorithm complexity. The finding of key motifs can be used to apply for system control, such as formulating containment policies for the spread of epidemics and protecting fragile ecosystems. Additionally, it makes substantial contribution to a deeper understanding of concepts in physics, such as signal propagation and system's stability.</description>

      <title>From Urban Clusters to Megaregions: Mapping Australia's Evolving Urban Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs percolation theory to investigate the hierarchical organisation of Australian urban centres through the connectivity of their road networks. The analysis demonstrates how discrete urban clusters have developed into integrated regional entities, delineating the pivotal distance thresholds that regulate these urban transitions. The study reveals the interconnections between disparate urban clusters, shaped by their functional differentiation and historical development. Furthermore, the study identifies a dichotomy of urban agglomeration forces and a persistent spatial disconnection between Australia's wider urban landscape. This highlights the interplay between urban densification and peripheral growth. It suggests the need for new thinking on potential integrated governance structures that bridge urban development with broader social and economic policies across regional and national scales. Additionally, the study emphasises the growing importance of national coordination in Australian urban development planning to ensure regional consistency, equity, and productivity.</description>

      <title>Uncovering key predictors of high-growth firms via explainable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting high-growth firms has attracted increasing interest from the technological forecasting and machine learning communities. Most existing studies primarily utilize financial data for these predictions. However, research suggests that a firm's research and development activities and its network position within technological ecosystems may also serve as valuable predictors. To unpack the relative importance of diverse features, this paper analyzes financial and patent data from 5,071 firms, extracting three categories of features: financial features, technological features of granted patents, and network-based features derived from firms' connections to their primary technologies. By utilizing ensemble learning algorithms, we demonstrate that incorporating financial features with either technological, network-based features, or both, leads to more accurate high-growth firm predictions compared to using financial features alone. To delve deeper into the matter, we evaluate the predictive power of each individual feature within their respective categories using explainable artificial intelligence methods. Among non-financial features, the maximum economic value of a firm's granted patents and the number of patents related to a firms' primary technologies stand out for their importance. Furthermore, firm size is positively associated with high-growth probability up to a certain threshold size, after which the association plateaus. Conversely, the maximum economic value of a firm's granted patents is positively linked to high-growth probability only after a threshold value is exceeded. These findings elucidate the complex predictive role of various features in forecasting high-growth firms and could inform technological resource allocation as well as investment decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the fields of natural and social sciences. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs), which utilize large language models in place of real subjects, are gaining increasing public attention. Far from aiming for comprehensiveness, this paper aims to offer readers an opportunity to understand how large language models are disrupting complex systems research and behavioral sciences. In particular, we evaluate recent advancements in various domains within complex systems, encompassing network science, evolutionary game theory, social dynamics, and epidemic propagation. Additionally, we propose possible directions for future research to further advance these fields.</description>

      <title>Bringing Leaders of Network Sub-Groups Closer Together Does Not Facilitate Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus formation is a complex process, particularly in networked groups. When individuals are incentivized to dig in and refuse to compromise, leaders may be essential to guiding the group to consensus. Specifically, the relative geodesic position of leaders (which we use as a proxy for ease of communication between leaders) could be important for reaching consensus. Additionally, groups searching for consensus can be confounded by noisy signals in which individuals are given false information about the actions of their fellow group members. We tested the effects of the geodesic distance between leaders (geodesic distance ranging from 1-4) and of noise (noise levels at 0%, 5%, and 10%) by recruiting participants (N=3,456) for a set of experiments (n=216 groups). We find that noise makes groups less likely to reach consensus, and the groups that do reach consensus take longer to find it. We find that leadership changes the behavior of both leaders and followers in important ways (for instance, being labeled a leader makes people more likely to 'go with the flow'). However, we find no evidence that the distance between leaders is a significant factor in the probability of reaching consensus. While other network properties of leaders undoubtedly impact consensus formation, the distance between leaders in network sub-groups appears not to matter.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-order Popularity and Similarity Mechanisms in Link Prediction by graphlet predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction has become a critical problem in network science and has thus attracted increasing research interest. Popularity and similarity are two primary mechanisms in the formation of real networks. However, the roles of popularity and similarity mechanisms in link prediction across various domain networks remain poorly understood. Accordingly, this study used orbit degrees of graphlets to construct multi-order popularity- and similarity-based network link predictors, demonstrating that traditional popularity- and similarity-based indices can be efficiently represented in terms of orbit degrees. Moreover, we designed a supervised learning model that fuses multiple orbit-degree-based features and validated its link prediction performance. We also evaluated the mean absolute Shapley additive explanations of each feature within this model across 550 real-world networks from six domains. We observed that the homophily mechanism, which is a similarity-based feature, dominated social networks, with its win rate being 91\%. Moreover, a different similarity-based feature was prominent in economic, technological, and information networks. Finally, no single feature dominated the biological and transportation networks. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and interpretability of link prediction, thus facilitating the analysis of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Long-term Dynamics of Complex Networks via Identifying Skeleton in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental for understanding, modeling, and controlling real-world complex systems. Though great efforts have been made to predict the future states of nodes on networks, the capability of capturing long-term dynamics remains largely limited. This is because they overlook the fact that long-term dynamics in complex network are predominantly governed by their inherent low-dimensional manifolds, i.e., skeletons. Therefore, we propose the Dynamics-Invariant Skeleton Neural Net}work (DiskNet), which identifies skeletons of complex networks based on the renormalization group structure in hyperbolic space to preserve both topological and dynamics properties. Specifically, we first condense complex networks with various dynamics into simple skeletons through physics-informed hyperbolic embeddings. Further, we design graph neural ordinary differential equations to capture the condensed dynamics on the skeletons. Finally, we recover the skeleton networks and dynamics to the original ones using a degree-based super-resolution module. Extensive experiments across three representative dynamics as well as five real-world and two synthetic networks demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed DiskNet, which outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10.18\% in terms of long-term prediction accuracy.

      <title>Temporal Interaction and its Role in the Evolution of Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of dynamic, time-varying interactions on cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.</description>

      <title>$(\omega_1, \omega_2)$-temporal random hyperbolic graphs</title>

Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on dynamical processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Each network is made of tube-like objects bound together at junction points, which we treat as nodes, with the connections between them considered as links. We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <title>Collective Memory, Consensus, and Learning Explained by Network Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. Intuitively, a group is more cohesive if people are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. This intuition is made precise by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the \textit{algebraic connectivity}. This measure is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>
