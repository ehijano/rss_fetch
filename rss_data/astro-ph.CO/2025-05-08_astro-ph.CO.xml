      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 2.5$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>nuGAN: Generative Adversarial Emulator for Cosmic Web with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of neutrino masses on the evolution of Universe is a crucial aspect of modern cosmology. Due to their large free streaming lengths, neutrinos significantly influence the formation of cosmic structures at non-linear scales. To maximize the information yield from current and future galaxy surveys, it is essential to generate precise theoretical predictions of structure formation. One approach to achieve this is by running large sets of cosmological numerical simulations, which is a computationally intensive process. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) model to emulate the Universe for a variety of neutrino masses. Our model called $\nu$GAN (for neutrino GAN) is able to generate 2D cosmic webs of the Universe for a number of neutrino masses ranging from 0.0 eV to 0.4 eV. The generated maps exhibit statistical independence, lack correlations with training data, and very closely resemble the distribution of matter in true maps. We assess the accuracy of our results both visually and through key statistics used in cosmology and computer vision analyses. Our results indicate that samples generated by $\nu$GAN are accurate within a 5% error on power spectrum between k=0.01 to k=0.5 h/Mpc. Although this accuracy covers the mildly non-linear scales, consistent with other works and observations, achieving higher accuracy at fully non-linear scales requires more sophisticated models, such as diffusion models. Nevertheless, our work opens up new avenues for building emulators to generate fast and massive neutrino simulations, potentially revolutionizing cosmological predictions and analyses. This work serves as a proof-of-concept, paving the way for future extensions with higher-resolution 3D data and advanced generative models.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of Stage-III cosmic shear surveys: A comprehensive study of shear diagnostic tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, weak lensing shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. These shear catalogs have undergone rigorous validation tests to ensure that the residual shear systematic effects in the catalogs are subdominant relative to the statistical uncertainties, such that the resulting cosmological constraints are unbiased. While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs -- the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails depending on whether the samples are weighted, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 185.3/13 for faint stars. We also find that DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 fail the $B$-mode test when estimated with the Hybrid-$E$/$B$ method, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 37.9/10 and 36.0/8 for the fourth and third autocorrelation bins. We assess the impacts on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination -- we find negligible effects in all cases. Finally, we propose strategies for performing these tests on future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>J-PAS and PFS surveys in the era of dark energy and neutrino mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>In search of an interaction in the dark sector through Gaussian Process and ANN approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$) or phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2]. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</description>

      <title>Extracting local velocity from cosmic dipole using simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our velocity with respect to the cosmic frame of rest leads to a dipole in the number count distribution of galaxies. The dipole depends on the source spectrum, which is usually assumed to be a power law, $S(\nu) \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ and on the flux dependence of the number density of sources. The latter is also generally assumed to be a power law, parametrised with exponent $x$. The velocity can be extracted from the observed dipole once the two parameters $x$ and $\alpha$ are known. The standard procedure uses the mean value of $\alpha$ across the entire sample, and the parameter $x$ is inferred by fitting the cumulative number count, $\frac{dN}{d\Omega}(&gt;S_*) \propto S_*^{-x}$, near the flux limit $S_*$ of the survey. Here, we introduce a simulation procedure to extract the velocity which directly uses the $\alpha$ values of each source rather than their mean and does not rely on the functional form of the cumulative number count near the flux limit. We apply this to the quasar sample in CatWISE2020 data and find that the final results differ from the standard procedure by approximately one sigma.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the GW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the sensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant parameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW detectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Improved Predictions on Higgs-Starobinsky Inflation and Reheating with ACT DR6 and Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of recent CMB observations for Higgs-Starobinsky inflationary models and their associated reheating dynamics, utilizing data from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. In addition to direct CMB constraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through limits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially relevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state $w_{\rm RH}\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of inflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the $2\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature is constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\rm RH} &gt; 0.41$. However, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\sigma$ C.L. once $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the Higgs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.</description>

      <title>Assessing the connection between galactic conformity and assembly-type bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies in the Universe show a conformity in the fraction of quenched galaxies out to large distances, being quite larger around quenched central galaxies than for star-forming ones. On the other hand, simulations have shown that the clustering of halos and the galaxies within them depends on secondary properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon termed assembly bias. Aims. Our aim is to study whether samples that show galactic conformity also show assembly bias and to see if the amplitude of these two effects is correlated. Methods. We use synthetic galaxies at $z = 0$ from the semi-analytical model SAG run on the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) cosmological simulation and measure both conformity and galaxy assembly bias for different samples of central galaxies at fixed host halo mass. We focus on central galaxies hosted by low-mass halos of 10$^{11.6}$ $\leq$ $M_{\rm h}$/$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{11.8}$ because it is a mass range where the assembly bias has been reported to be strong. The samples of central galaxies are separated according to their specific star formation rate and stellar age. Results. We find that the level of conformity shown by our different samples is correlated with the level of assembly bias measured for them. We also find that removing galaxies around massive halos diminishes the conformity signal and lowers the amount of assembly bias. Conclusions. The high correlation in the amplitude of conformity and assembly bias for different samples with and without removing galaxies near massive halos clearly indicates the strong relationship between both phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories at different scales: averaging the scalar sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the averaging of a scalar degree of freedom that couples universally to matter. It quantifies the approximation of smoothing the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. In the case of Yukawa theories, which enjoy a linear Klein--Gordon equation, the averaging commutes with the field equation as one might expect. While all small-scale distributions of matter lead to field distributions with the same mean, the latter can have different energy densities and pressures when the Compton wavelength of the field is smaller than the smoothing scale. In the non-linear case, such as chameleon theories, this study quantifies the error made by averaging the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. While field fluctuations can become arbitrarily large when the matter source is screened, the commutativity property of linear theories is recovered in the unscreened regime. Implications for cosmology -- and in particular the equation of state in extended quintessence models -- and for laboratory experiments in low density medium are discussed. This analysis, although based on a simplifying description, sheds light on the effects of the small-scale distribution of matter as well as on the care required to define their equation of state and their cosmological signature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in Horndeski gravity: a renormalized approach to effective gravitational coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a renormalized perturbation theory framework for nonlinear structure formation in a broad class of modified gravity models that exhibit Vainshtein screening, with a focus on a viable subclass of Horndeski theories. We extend earlier perturbative methods, originally applied to DGP model, to construct a self-consistent treatment that captures both the linear modifications to gravity at large scales and the nonlinear screening effects at small scales. In the framework, the response of the gravitational potential to matter density fluctuations is characterized by renormalized propagators, leading to the definition of a nonlinear (or renormalized) effective gravitational constant. The paper details several numerical strategies to compute this renormalized gravitational constant. Numerical examples illustrate how the effective gravitational constant evolves with scale and redshift. These results are key to accurately predicting cosmological observables such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum in modified gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>

Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame, revealing a breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling a non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial components of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and clipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill the equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that this defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum conservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and flat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the drawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero the local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its presence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as a central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.</description>

      <title>Testing Thermal-Relic Dark Matter with a Dark Photon Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of recent DAMIC-M results, we present the status of thermal-relic dark matter $\chi$ coupled to a kinetically-mixed dark photon $A^\prime$. In the predictive "direct annihilation" regime, $m_{A'} &gt; m_\chi$, the relic abundance depends on the kinetic mixing parameter, and there is a minimum value compatible with thermal freeze out. Using only electron and nuclear recoil direct detection results, we find that for complex scalar dark matter, the direct-annihilation regime is now excluded for nearly all values of $m_\chi$; the only exception is the resonant annihilation regime where $m_{A'}\approx 2 m_\chi$. Direct annihilation relic targets for other representative models, including Majorana and Pseudo-Dirac candidates, remain viable across a wide range of model parameters, but will be tested with a combination of dedicated accelerator searches in the near future. In the opposite "secluded annihilation" regime, where $m_\chi &gt; m_{A'}$, this scenario is excluded by cosmic microwave background measurements for all $m_\chi \lesssim 30$ GeV. Similar conclusions in both the direct and secluded regimes hold for all anomaly-free vector mediators that couple to the first generation of electrically-charged Standard Model particles.</description>

      <title>Recovering a phase transition signal in simulated LISA data with a modulated galactic foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from primordial first-order phase transitions are a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. They represent one of the best prospects for observing or constraining new physics with the LISA gravitational wave observatory. However, the large foreground population of galactic binaries in the same frequency range represents a challenge, and will hinder the recovery of a stochastic background. To test the recoverability of a stochastic gravitational wave background, we use the LISA Simulation Suite to generate data incorporating both a stochastic background and an annually modulated foreground modelling the galactic binary population, and the Bayesian analysis code Cobaya to attempt to recover the model parameters. By applying the Deviance Information Criterion to compare models with and without a stochastic background we place bounds on the detectability of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions. By further comparing models with and without the annual modulation, we show that exploiting the modulation improves the goodness-of-fit and gives a modest improvement to the bounds on detectable models.</description>

      <title>Inferring IGM parameters from the redshifted 21-cm Power Spectrum using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high redshift 21-cm signal promises to be a crucial probe of the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Understanding the connection between the observed 21-cm power spectrum and the physical quantities intricately associated with the IGM is crucial to fully understand the evolution of our Universe. In this study, we develop an emulator using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the 21-cm power spectrum from a given set of IGM properties, namely, the bubble size distribution and the volume averaged ionization fraction. This emulator is implemented within a standard Bayesian framework to constrain the IGM parameters from a given 21-cm power spectrum. We compare the performance of the Bayesian method to an alternate method using ANN to predict the IGM parameters from a given input power spectrum, and find that both methods yield similar levels of accuracy, while the ANN is significantly faster. We also use this ANN method of parameter estimation to predict the IGM parameters from a test set contaminated with noise levels expected from the SKA-LOW instrument after 1000 hours of observation. Finally, we train a separate ANN to predict the source parameters from the IGM parameters directly, at a redshift of $z=9.1$, demonstrating the possibility of a non-analytic inference of the source parameters from the IGM parameters for the first time. We achieve high accuracies, with R2-scores ranging between $0.898-0.978$ for the ANN emulator and between $0.966-0.986$ and $0.817-0.981$ for the predictions of IGM parameters from 21-cm power spectrum and source parameters from IGM parameters, respectively. The predictions of the IGM parameters from the Bayesian method incorporating the ANN emulator leads to tight constraints with error bars around $\pm{0.14}$ on the IGM parameters.</description>

      <title>On the virialization threshold for halo mass functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study by Euclid collaboration, the halo mass function (HMF) has been fitted with accuracy better than $1\%$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several parameters were introduced and fitted against N-body simulations, assuming the usual linearly extrapolated matter density contrast at the collapse time, $\delta_c$, as a basic threshold for halo formation. As a result, a new function that multiplies $\delta_c$ was introduced, producing an effective threshold that varies both with redshift and mass scale. We show that the redshift evolution of this effective threshold is similar to the one of the linear extrapolated matter density contrast at the virialization time, $\delta_{\rm v}$. Assuming the Euclid HMF as a fiducial model, we refit the Sheth-Tormen (ST) HMF using $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a threshold. This new fit improves the agreement between ST-HMF and the Euclid one with respect to Despali et al. (2016) fit, specially at high masses. Interestingly, the parameters $a$ and $p$ in this refit have values closer to the Press-Schechter limit of the ST-HMF, showing that the use of $\delta_{\rm v}$ can provide semi-analytical HMF less dependent on extra parameters. Moreover, we analyze the consistency of the ST-HMF fitted with $\delta_{\rm v}$ in smooth dark energy models with time-varying equation of state, finding an overall good agreement with the evolution of halo abundances expected from the linear evolution of perturbations and the Euclid HMF extrapolated to these scenarios. These findings suggest that the use $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a basic function to describe the threshold for halo formation can be a good guide when considering extrapolations for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, which are typically harder to study in simulations.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Dark Energy Models with $\Lambda$ as an Equilibrium Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter by assuming that it satisfies a law of motion described by an autonomous second-order differential equation, with the limit of the cosmological constant as an equilibrium point. We determine the asymptotic solutions of this equation and use them to construct two families of parametric dark energy models, employing both linear and logarithmic parametrization with respect to the scale factor. We perform observational constraints by using the Supernova, the Cosmic Chronometers and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations of DESI DR2. The constraint parameters are directly related with the initial value problem for the law of motion and its algebraic properties. The analysis shows that most of the models fit the observational data well with a preference to the models of the logarithmic parametrization. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of models as generalizations of the CPL model, for which the equilibrium point is a constant value rather than the cosmological constant. These models fit the data in a similar or better way to the CPL and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in tomographic Angular Density and Redshift Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes, namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z \neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF (ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time, configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for wider shell ($\sigma_z&gt;0.02$) configurations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Bounce Energy Scale in Bouncing Cosmologies with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we constrain the bounce energy scale $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ in a generic framework of bouncing cosmologies using the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav 15-yr, EPTA DR2, PPTA DR3, IPTA DR2). A full Bayesian fit of the analytic SGWB spectrum for this bounce scenario reveals, for the first time, two distinct posterior branches in $(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4},w_1)$: one near $w_1\approx0.3$ and one at $w_1\gg1$, where $w_1$ is the contraction phase equation of state. We find that the bouncing model attains larger Bayes factors against each of six conventional SGWB sources (SMBHBs, inflationary GWs, cosmic strings, domain walls, first order phase transitions, scalar induced GWs), demonstrating strong preference of current PTA data for the bounce hypothesis. Compared to the more generic dual inflation bounce scenario, the concrete bounce realization yields smaller Bayes factors, indicating that PTA measurements impose tighter constraints when the bounce scale is explicit. Moreover, the two posterior branches illuminate distinct theoretical frontiers. The right branch ($w_1\gg1$) violates the dominant energy condition (DEC), thereby providing direct empirical impetus for models with novel early Universe physics, e.g. ghost condensates, higher-derivative or modified gravity operators, and extra dimensional effects. Independently, both branches infer $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ above the Planck scale $M_\mathrm{pl}$, demonstrating that current PTAs already probe trans-Planckian regimes. Together, these findings offer a rare observational window into UV completions of cosmology. We further describe how normalizing flow based machine learning can accelerate such Bayesian analyses as PTA data volumes increase.</description>

Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement shows inconsistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation in $\Lambda$CDM. We used the Bayesian suspiciousness and goodness-of-fit tension metrics to quantify the significance of the tension. Both tension metrics consistently confirm a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between DESI BAO and CMB. We identified the key assumptions of $\Lambda$CDM underlying the tension between BAO and CMB. If the tension is physical, one or multiple of the assumptions might need to be broken by the potential new physics addressing the tension. In particular, the analysis shows that if dynamical dark energy is the only new physics behind the tension, phantom crossing is required to restore concordance between CMB and BAO.</description>

      <title>An interference-based method for the detection of strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strongly lensed gravitational wave (SLGW) is a promising transient phenomenon. However, the long-wave nature of gravitational waves poses a significant challenge in identification of its host galaxy. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method triggered by the wave optics effect of microlensing. The microlensing interference introduce frequency-dependent fluctuations in the waveform. Our method consists of three steps. First, we reconstruct the waveforms by using the template-independent and template-dependent methods. The mismatch of two reconstructions serves as an indicator of SLGWs. This step can identify approximately $10\%$ SLGWs. Second, we pair the SLGWs' multiple-images by employing the sky localization overlapping. Because we have pre-identified at least one image through microlensing, the false alarm probability for pairing SLGWs is significantly reduced. Third, we search the host galaxy by requiring the consistency of time-delays between galaxy-galaxy lensing and SLGW. By combing the stage-IV galaxy survey and the third-generation gravitational wave detectors, we expect to find, on average, 1 quadruple-image system per 3 years. The merit of this method can significantly facilitate the pursuit of time-delay cosmography, discovery of compact objects and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DMRadio-m$^3$ is an experiment that is designed to be sensitive to KSVZ and DFSZ QCD axion models in the 10--200\,MHz (41 neV$/c^2$ -- 0.83 $\mu$eV/$c^2$) range. The experiment uses a solenoidal dc magnetic field to convert an axion dark-matter signal to an ac electromagnetic response in a coaxial copper pickup. The current induced by this axion signal is measured by dc SQUIDs. In this work, we present the electromagnetic modeling of the response of the experiment to an axion signal over the full frequency range of DMRadio-m$^3$, which extends from the low-frequency, lumped-element limit to a regime where the axion Compton wavelength is only a factor of two larger than the detector size. With these results, we determine the live time and sensitivity of the experiment. The primary science goal of sensitivity to DFSZ axions across 30--200 MHz can be achieved with a $3\sigma$ live scan time of 2.9 years.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$.

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.</description>

      <title>Are compact groups of galaxies special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But only few studies compared CGs to regular groups. We study the global properties and internal correlations of a volume- and luminosity-complete subsample of 78 groups of four members (CG4s), within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups. We compare them to those of a similarly built subsample (including the 3-magnitude range of CG4s) of the Lim et al. regular groups. The latter are split into three control samples: one with the four brightest members (Control4Bs), one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s (especially those split among several regular groups) have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of Gravitational Waves Induced by Primordial Isocurvature Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial isocurvature perturbations, which can arise from various sources in the early Universe, have the potential to leave observable imprints on the gravitational-wave background and provide insights into the nature of primordial fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the gauge dependence of induced gravitational waves (IGWs) sourced by these isocurvature perturbations during radiation dominated era and the kination period in the early universe. We analyze the energy density spectra of IGWs in three different gauges: synchronous, Newtonian, and uniform curvature gauges. To facilitate this analysis, we derive analytical solutions for the perturbations that contribute to the IGW spectra and a general gauge transformation from Newtonian gauge to an arbitrary gauge. Our results reveal significant differences in the energy spectra across these gauges. We find that the energy density of IGWs during radiation domination increases with conformal time as $\eta^8$ and $\eta^4$ for synchronous and uniform curvature gauges, respectively, while it converges in the Newtonian gauge. These findings highlight the importance of gauge choice in calculating IGWs and have implications for the interpretation of future observations of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Cosmic (super)strings with a time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic (super)strings offer promising ways to test ideas about the early universe and physics at high energies. While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction for circular orbits in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we derive the dynamical friction force considering soliton density profiles for both non-interacting and strongly self-interacting ULDM. Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively. We constrain the parameter space for ULDM particle mass and self-coupling constant, which are consistent with other constraints from astronomical and cosmological observations.</description>
