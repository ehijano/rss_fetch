      <title>A Discrete Analog of Tutte's Barycentric Embeddings on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tutte's celebrated barycentric embedding theorem describes a natural way to build straight-line embeddings (crossing-free drawings) of a (3-connected) planar graph: map the vertices of the outer face to the vertices of a convex polygon, and ensure that each remaining vertex is in convex position, namely, a barycenter with positive coefficients of its neighbors. Actually computing an embedding then boils down to solving a system of linear equations. A particularly appealing feature of this method is the flexibility given by the choice of the barycentric weights. Generalizations of Tutte's theorem to surfaces of nonpositive curvature are known, but due to their inherently continuous nature, they do not lead to an algorithm.
  In this paper, we propose a purely discrete analog of Tutte's theorem for surfaces (with or without boundary) of nonpositive curvature, based on the recently introduced notion of reducing triangulations. We prove a Tutte theorem in this setting: every drawing homotopic to an embedding such that each vertex is harmonious (a discrete analog of being in convex position) is a weak embedding (arbitrarily close to an embedding). We also provide a polynomial-time algorithm to make an input drawing harmonious without increasing the length of any edge, in a similar way as a drawing can be put in convex position without increasing the edge lengths.</description>

      <title>Untangling Graphs on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a graph drawn on a surface (for example, the plane minus a finite set of obstacle points), possibly with crossings. We provide an algorithm to decide whether such a drawing can be untangled, namely, if one can slide the vertices and edges of the graph on the surface (avoiding the obstacles) to remove all crossings; in other words, whether the drawing is homotopic to an embedding. While the problem boils down to planarity testing when the surface is the sphere or the disk (or equivalently the plane without any obstacle), the other cases have never been studied before, except when the input graph is a cycle, in an abundant literature in topology and more recently by Despr\'e and Lazarus [SoCG 2017, J. ACM 2019].
  Our algorithm runs in O(m + poly(g+b) n log n) time, where g &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0 are the genus and the number of boundary components of the input orientable surface S, and n is the size of the input graph drawing, lying on some fixed graph of size m cellularly embedded on S.
  We use various techniques from two-dimensional computational topology and from the theory of hyperbolic surfaces. Most notably, we introduce reducing triangulations, a novel discrete analog of hyperbolic surfaces in the spirit of systems of quads by Lazarus and Rivaud [FOCS 2012] and Erickson and Whittlesey [SODA 2013], which have the additional benefit that reduced paths are unique and stable upon reversal; they are likely of independent interest. Tailored data structures are needed to achieve certain homotopy tests efficiently on these triangulations. As a key subroutine, we rely on an algorithm to test the weak simplicity of a graph drawn on a surface by Akitaya, Fulek, and T\'oth [SODA 2018, TALG 2019].</description>
