      <title>Attaining high accuracy for charge-transfer excitations in non-covalent complexes at second-order perturbation cost: the importance of state-specific self-consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermolecular charge-transfer (xCT) excited states important for various practical applications are challenging for many standard computational methods. It is highly desirable to have an affordable method that can treat xCT states accurately. In the present work, we extend our self-consistent perturbation methods, named one-body second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (OBMP2) and its spin-opposite scaling variant, for excited states without additional costs to the ground state. We then assessed their performance for the prediction of xCT excitation energies. Thanks to self-consistency, our methods yield small errors relative to high-level coupled cluster methods and outperform other same scaling ($N^5$) methods like CC2 and ADC(2). In particular, the spin-opposite scaling variant (O2BMP2), whose scaling can be reduced to $N^4$, can even reach the accuracy of CC3 ($N^7$) with errors less than 0.1 eV. This method is thus highly promising for treating xCT states in large compounds vital for applications.</description>

      <title>Pair Approximating the Action For Molecular Rotations in Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair Discrete Variable Representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed Helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pair-wise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Therefore, our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pair-wise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner-Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behaviour of the pair-DVR method near criticality. Density Matrix Renormalization Group results are used for benchmarking throughout.</description>

      <title>Configuration weights in coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of the weight of any given Slater determinant in the coupled-cluster state, namely as the expectation value of the projection operator onto that determinant. The definition can be applied to any coupled-cluster formulation, including conventional coupled-cluster theory, nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled-cluster theory, and extended coupled-cluster theory. Numerical experiments show that for single-reference systems the coupled-cluster weights are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full configuration-interaction wave function. Moreover, the well-known insensitivity of the total energy obtained from truncated coupled-cluster models to the choice of orbital basis is clearly exposed by weights computed in the $\hat{T}_1$-transformed determinant basis. We demonstrate that the inseparability of the conventional linear parameterization of the bra (left state) for systems composed of noninteracting subsystems may lead to ill-behaved (negative or greater than unity) weights, an issue that can only be fully remedied by switching to extended coupled-cluster theory. The latter is corroborated by results obtained with quadratic coupled-cluster theory, which is shown numerically to yield a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Numerically Stable Resonating Hartree-Fock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of excited states at low computational cost remains an open challenge for electronic structure (ES) methods. While much attention has been given to orthogonal ES methods, relatively little work has been done to develop nonorthogonal ES methods for excited states, particularly those involving nonorthogonal orbital optimization. We present here a numerically stable formulation of the Resonating Hartree-Fock (ResHF) method that uses the matrix adjugate to remove numerical instabilities in ResHF arising from nearly orthogonal orbitals, and we demonstrate improvements to ResHF wavefunction optimization as a result. We then benchmark the performance of ResHF against Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field in the avoided crossing of LiF, the torsional rotation of ethene, and the singlet-triplet energy gaps of a selection of small molecules. ResHF is a promising excited state method because it incorporates the orbital relaxation of state-specific methods, while retaining the correct state crossings of state-averaged approaches. Our open-source ResHF implementation, yucca, is available on GitLab.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Potentials for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainable production of many bulk chemicals relies on heterogeneous catalysis. The rational design or improvement of the required catalysts critically depends on insights into the underlying mechanisms at the atomic scale. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in applying advanced experimental techniques to complex catalytic reactions in operando, but in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding, additional information from computer simulations is indispensable in many cases. In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has become an important tool to explicitly address the atomistic level structure, dynamics, and reactivity of interfacial systems, but the high computational costs limit applications to systems consisting of at most a few hundred atoms for simulation times of up to tens of picoseconds. Rapid advances in the development of modern machine learning potentials (MLP) now offer a new approach to bridge this gap, enabling simulations of complex catalytic reactions with ab initio accuracy at a small fraction of the computational costs. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of applying MLPs to systems relevant for heterogeneous catalysis along with a discussion of the prospects for the use of MLPs in catalysis science in the years to come.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric computation of molecular excited states with extended sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of molecular electronic structure is an important application of quantum devices. Recently, it has been shown that quantum devices can be effectively combined with classical supercomputing centers in the context of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) algorithm. This allowed the largest electronic structure quantum simulation to date (77 qubits) and opened near-term devices to practical use cases in chemistry toward the hundred-qubit mark. However, the description of many important physical and chemical properties of those systems, such as photo-absorption/-emission, requires a treatment that goes beyond the ground state alone. In this work, we extend the SQD algorithm to determine low-lying molecular excited states. The extended-SQD method improves over the original SQD method in accuracy, at the cost of an additional computational step. It also improves over quantum subspace expansion based on single and double electronic excitations, a widespread approach to excited states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices, in both accuracy and efficiency. We employ the extended SQD method to compute the first singlet (S$_1$) and triplet (T$_1$) excited states of the nitrogen molecule with a correlation-consistent basis set, and the ground- and excited-state properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster.</description>

      <title>Transition Path and Interface Sampling of Stochastic Schr\"odinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rare transitions in Markovian open quantum systems driven with Gaussian noise, applying transition path and interface sampling methods to trajectories generated by stochastic Schr\"odinger dynamics. Interface and path sampling offer insights into rare event transition mechanisms while simultaneously establishing a quantitative measure of the associated rate constant. Here, we extend their domain to systems described by stochastic Schr\"odinger equations. As a specific example, we explore a model of quantum Brownian motion in a quartic double well, consisting of a particle coupled to a Caldeira-Leggett oscillator bath, where we note significant departures from the Arrhenius law at low temperatures due to the presence of an anti-Zeno effect.</description>

Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of many of these experiments relies on understanding how the spin of unpaired electrons exchanges energy with their environment, or lattice, and relaxes to equilibrium. In this work, we overcome the common use of effective spin Hamiltonians to describe spin-lattice relaxation in spin-1/2 and apply ab initio open quantum systems theory to their full molecular electronic wavefunction. Simulations for two Cr(V) coordination compounds under this framework show a dramatic improvement in accuracy and demonstrate that relaxation in spin-1/2 molecules is enabled by virtual transitions to molecular excited states with energy approaching 20,000 cm$^{-1}$. This work establishes a connection between the original theory of Van Vleck and modern electronic structure methods, ultimately exemplifying the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to spin-lattice relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational ab-initio methods in quantum chemistry stand out among other methods in providing direct access to the wave function. This allows in principle straightforward extraction of any other observable of interest, besides the energy, but in practice this extraction is often technically difficult and computationally impractical. Here, we consider the electron density as a central observable in quantum chemistry and introduce a novel method to obtain accurate densities from real-space many-electron wave functions by representing the density with a neural network that captures known asymptotic properties and is trained from the wave function by score matching and noise-contrastive estimation. We use variational quantum Monte Carlo with deep-learning ans\"atze (deep QMC) to obtain highly accurate wave functions free of basis set errors, and from them, using our novel method, correspondingly accurate electron densities, which we demonstrate by calculating dipole moments, nuclear forces, contact densities, and other density-based properties.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Energy Transfer Between Redox-Active Colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redox-based electrical conduction in nonconjugated polymers has been explored less than a decade, yet is already showing promise as a new concept for electrical energy transport. Here using monolayers and sub-monolayers of touching micron-sized redox active colloids (RAC) containing high densities of ethyl-viologen (EV) side groups, intercolloid redox-based electron transport was directly observed via fluorescence microscopy. This observation was enabled by the discovery that these RAC exhibit a highly non-linear electrofluorochromism which can be quantitatively coupled to the colloid redox state. By evaluating the quasi-Fickian nature of the charge transfer (CT) kinetics, the apparent CT diffusion coefficient DCT was extracted. Along with addressing more fundamental questions regarding energy transport in colloidal materials, this first real-time real-space imaging of energy transport within monolayers of redox-active colloids may provide insights into energy transfer in flow batteries, and enable design of new forms of conductive polymers for applications including organic electronics.</description>

      <title>Are large language models superhuman chemists?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained.
  However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists.
  We curated more than 2,700 question-answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions.
  These findings reveal LLMs' impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>
