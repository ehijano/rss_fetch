      <title>Active Prostate Phantom with Multiple Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major global health concern, requiring advancements in robotic surgery and diagnostics to improve patient outcomes. A phantom is a specially designed object that simulates human tissues or organs. It can be used for calibrating and testing a medical process, as well as for training and research purposes. Existing prostate phantoms fail to simulate dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a pneumatically actuated prostate phantom with multiple independently controlled chambers, allowing for precise volumetric adjustments to replicate asymmetric and symmetric benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The phantom is designed based on shape analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets, modeled with finite element method (FEM), and validated through 3D reconstruction. The simulation results showed strong agreement with physical measurements, achieving average errors of 3.47% in forward modeling and 1.41% in inverse modeling. These results demonstrate the phantom's potential as a platform for validating robotic-assisted systems and for further development toward realistic simulation-based medical training.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enabled virtual multiplexed immunostaining of label-free tissue for vascular invasion assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&amp;E virtual staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&amp;E) of the same tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Transcranial Photoacoustic Imaging for Human Intracranial Pressure Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), by combining high optical contrast with ultrasonic resolution, offers a promising noninvasive approach for dynamic monitoring of cerebral vasculature. However, transcranial PAI still faces significant challenges due to strong attenuation of both optical and acoustic signals by the skull. In this study, we propose a multi-wavelength photoacoustic tomography system and method for intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment, enabling visualization of cross-sectional structures of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) through the human temporal bone. By utilizing multi-wavelength excitation in the near-infrared-I (NIR-I) window, quantitative maps of blood oxygen saturation ($\mathbf{sO_2}$) are reconstructed, and the relationship between oxygenation dynamics and ICP variations is established. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully capture dynamic $\mathbf{sO_2}$ fluctuations in the MCA despite skull attenuation, revealing its characteristic responses to ICP changes. This work provides a high-precision, noninvasive imaging tool for early stroke diagnosis, cerebral vascular function assessment, and neurointerventional guidance, highlighting the clinical translational potential of PAI in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Turbo Spin Echo Imaging at 7T with Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions Method for Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and Proton Density Contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which was initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is adapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for obtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and Methods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters are acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have complimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan parameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the BOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast, homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are used individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps are utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors respectively.
  Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained with the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive field inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE acquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor.
  Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed from the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.</description>
