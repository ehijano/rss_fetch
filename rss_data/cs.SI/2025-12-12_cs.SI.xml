      <title>Enhancing Fake-News Detection with Node-Level Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news has posed serious threats to individuals and society, spurring intense research into automated detection methods. Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Framework for Studying Recommendation-Network Co-evolution in Social Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying how recommendation systems reshape social networks is difficult on live platforms: confounds abound, and controlled experiments risk user harm. We present an agent-based simulator where content production, tie formation, and a graph attention network (GAT) recommender co-evolve in a closed loop. We calibrate parameters using Mastodon data and validate out-of-sample against Bluesky (4--6\% error on structural metrics; 10--15\% on held-out temporal splits). Across 18 configurations at 100 agents, we find that \emph{activation timing} affects outcomes: introducing recommendations at $t=10$ vs.\ $t=40$ decreases transitivity by 10\% while engagement differs by $&lt;$8\%. Delaying activation increases content diversity by 9\% while reducing modularity by 4\%. Scaling experiments ($n$ up to 5,000) show the effect persists but attenuates. Jacobian analysis confirms local stability under bounded reactance parameters. We release configuration schemas and reproduction scripts.</description>

      <title>Understanding Toxic Interaction Across User and Video Clusters in Social Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social video platforms shape how people access information, while recommendation systems can narrow exposure and increase the risk of toxic interaction. Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics.</description>

      <title>The Circulate and Recapture Dynamic of Fan Mobility in Agency-Affiliated VTuber Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VTuber agencies -- multichannel networks (MCNs) that bundle Virtual YouTubers (VTubers) on YouTube -- curate portfolios of channels and coordinate programming, cross appearances, and branding in the live-streaming VTuber ecosystem. It remains unclear whether affiliation binds fans to a single channel or instead encourages movement within a portfolio that buffers exit, and how these micro level dynamics relate to meso level audience overlap. This study examines how affiliation shapes short horizon viewer trajectories and the organization of audience overlap networks by contrasting agency affiliated and independent VTubers. Using a large, multiyear, fan centered panel of VTuber live stream engagement on YouTube, we construct monthly audience overlap between creators with a similarity measure that is robust to audience size asymmetries. At the micro level, we track retention, changes in the primary creator watched (oshi), and inactivity; at the meso level, we compare structural properties of affiliation specific subgraphs and visualize viewer state transitions. The analysis identifies a pattern of loose mobility: fans tend to remain active while reallocating attention within the same affiliation type, with limited leakage across affiliation type. Network results indicate convergence in global overlap while local neighborhoods within affiliated subgraphs remain persistently denser. Flow diagrams reveal circulate and recapture dynamics that stabilize participation without relying on single channel lock in. We contribute a reusable measurement framework for VTuber live streaming that links micro level trajectories to meso level organization and informs research on creator labor, influencer marketing, and platform governance on video platforms. We do not claim causal effects; the observed regularities are consistent with proximity engineered by VTuber agencies and coordinated recapture.</description>

      <title>Balancing Turnover and Promotion Outcomes: Evidence on the Optimal Hybrid-Work Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid work policy, especially return-to-office requirements, remains a globally salient topic as workers, companies, and governments continue to debate and disagree. Despite extensive discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of remote and hybrid arrangements, the optimal number of remote days that jointly considers multiple organizational outcomes has not been empirically established. Focusing on two critical career outcomes -- turnover risk and promotion -- we examine how remote work frequency shapes employee trajectories using large-scale observational activity data from a company with over one million employees. We find that increased remote-work frequency is associated with an initial decrease and then an increase in turnover, while promotion likelihood initially rises and then declines. Accordingly, we identify approximately two remote days per week as an optimal balance -- maximizing promotion, a positive outcome for employees, while minimizing turnover, which is undesirable for organizations and may indicate negative employee experiences. These patterns vary across subgroups defined by gender, role type, and leadership status. Several notable results emerge. First, male employees derive greater promotion benefits from remote work than female employees. Second, support workers (non-core business roles) do not experience promotion gains, and the reduction in turnover at their optimal remote-work frequency is marginal compared with employees in core business roles. Third, organizational leaders face greater challenges in remote settings than individual contributors: their turnover risk increases substantially at higher remote frequencies, and their likelihood of promotion decreases as remote frequency rises. We further show that time-allocation patterns partly explain how remote-work frequency influences these career outcomes.</description>

      <title>Kicking Politics: How Football Fan Communities Became Arenas for Political Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how political campaigns engaged UK football fan communities on Twitter in the aftermath of the Brexit Referendum (2016-2017). Football fandom, with its strong collective identities and tribal behaviours, offers fertile ground for political influence. Combining social network and content analysis, we examine how political discourse became embedded in football conversations. We show that a wide range of actors -- including parties, media, activist groups, and pseudonymous influencers -- mobilised support, provoked reactions, and shaped opinion within these communities. Through case studies of hashtag hijacking, embedded activism, and political "megaphones", we illustrate how campaigns leveraged fan cultures to amplify political messages. Our findings highlight mechanisms of political influence in ostensibly non-political online spaces and point toward the development of a broader framework in future work.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Automation: How Bots Shaped Political Discourse in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where social media platforms are central to political communication, the activity of bots raises pressing concerns about amplification, manipulation, and misinformation. Drawing on more than 315 million tweets posted from August 2018 to June 2022, we examine behavioural patterns, sentiment dynamics, and the thematic focus of bot- versus human-generated content spanning the 2018 Brazilian presidential election and the lead-up to the 2022 contest. Our analysis shows that bots relied disproportionately on retweets and replies, with reply activity spiking after the 2018 election, suggesting tactics of conversational infiltration and amplification. Sentiment analysis indicates that bots maintained a narrower emotional tone, in contrast to humans, whose sentiment fluctuated more strongly with political events. Topic modelling further reveals bots' repetitive, Bolsonaro-centric messaging, while human users engaged with a broader range of candidates, civic concerns, and personal reflections. These findings underscore bots' role as amplifiers of narrow agendas and their potential to distort online political discourse.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.</description>

      <title>Topology Identification and Inference over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.</description>

      <title>Supporting Migration Policies with Forecasts: Illegal Border Crossings in Europe through a Mixed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.</description>

      <title>Quantifying displacement: a gentrification's consequence via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gentrification is the process by which wealthier individuals move into a previously lower-income neighbourhood. Among the effects of this multi-faceted phenomenon are rising living costs, cultural and social changes-where local traditions, businesses, and community networks are replaced or diluted by new, more affluent lifestyles-and population displacement, where long-term, lower-income residents are priced out by rising rents and property taxes. Despite its relevance, quantifying displacement presents difficulties stemming from lack of information on motives for relocation and from the fact that a long time-span must be analysed: displacement is a gradual process (leases end or conditions change at different times), impossible to capture in one data snapshot. We introduce a novel tool to overcome these difficulties. Using only publicly available address change data, we construct four cubical complexes which simultaneously incorporate geographical and temporal information of people moving, and then analyse them building on Topological Data Analysis tools. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this method through a 20-year case study of Madrid, Spain. The results reveal its ability to capture population displacement and to identify the specific neighbourhoods and years affected--patterns that cannot be inferred from raw address change data.</description>

      <title>How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</description>

      <title>Potential Landscapes Reveal Spatiotemporal Structure in Urban Mobility: Hodge Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis of Tokyo Before and During COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is vital to solving societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Recent advancements in data collection now enable the exploration of dynamic mobility patterns in human flow. However, the vast volume and complexity of mobility data make it difficult to interpret spatiotemporal patterns directly, necessitating effective information reduction. The core challenge is to balance data simplification with information preservation: methods must retain location-specific information about human flows from origins to destinations while reducing the data to a comprehensible level. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework: First, combinatorial Hodge theory is applied to the given origin--destination (OD) matrices with timestamps to construct a set of potential landscapes of human flow, preserving imbalanced trip information between locations. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) expresses the time series of potential landscapes as a linear combination of a few static spatial components, with their coefficients representing temporal variations. The framework systematically decouples the spatial and temporal components of the given data. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal large weight variations during a pandemic, characterized by an overall decline in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and its potential to inform urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <title>The relationship between offline partisan geographical segregation and online partisan segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media is often blamed for the creation of echo chambers. However, these claims fail to consider the prevalence of offline echo chambers resulting from high levels of partisan segregation in the United States. Our article empirically assesses these online versus offline dynamics by linking a novel dataset of voters' offline partisan segregation extracted from publicly available voter files for 180 million US voters with their online network segregation on Twitter. We investigate offline and online partisan segregation using measures of geographical and network isolation of every matched voter-twitter user to their co-partisans online and offline. Our results show that while social media users tend to form politically homogeneous online networks, these levels of partisan sorting are significantly lower than those found in offline settings. Notably, Democrats are more isolated than Republicans in both settings, and only older Republicans exhibit higher online than offline segregation. Our results contribute to the emerging literature on political communication and the homophily of online networks, providing novel evidence on partisan sorting both online and offline.</description>

Abstract: Incomplete node features are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, e.g., the attributes of web users may be partly private, which causes the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decline significantly. Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings.</description>
