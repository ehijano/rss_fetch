      <title>Nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of barium titanate nanocrystals determined via a polymer nanocomposite approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for high energy storage materials has garnered substantial attention towards lead-free ferroelectric nanocrystals (NCs), such as BaTiO3 (BTO), for next-generation multilayer ceramic capacitors. Notably, it remains challenging to accurately measure the dielectric constant and polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for BTO NCs. Herein, we report on nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of BTO NCs via a polymer nanocomposite approach. Specifically, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP)/BTO nanocomposite films of 3-10 {\mu}m thickness, containing 380 nm tetragonal-phased and 60 nm cubic-phased BTO NCs with uniform particle dispersion, were prepared. Theoretical deconvolution of the broad experimental P-E loops of the PVP/BTO NC composite films revealed three contributions, that is, the linear deformational polarization of the nanocomposites, the polarization of BTO NCs (Pp ), and the polarization from strong particle-particle interactions. Using different mixing rules and nonlinear dielectric analysis, the overall dielectric constants of BTO NCs were obtained, from which the internal field in the BTO NCs (Ep ) was estimated. Consequently, the Pp-Ep hysteresis loops were obtained for the BTO380 and BTO60 NCs. Interestingly, BTO380 exhibited square-shaped ferroelectric loops, whereas BTO60 displayed slim paraelectric loops. This work presents a robust and versatile route to extract the Pp-Ep loops of ferroelectric NCs from polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle energies and excitonic effects of {\alpha}-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening of charge-order-induced ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-order-induced ferroelectrics display important technological applications in spintronics devices due to the possibility of magnetoelectric coupling and fast electronic switching. However, the list of known charge-order-induced ferroelectrics remains limited, hindering the fundamental understanding of the phenomena and the optimization of materials for real applications. In this work, we develop a high-throughput workflow to screen for charge-order-induced ferroelectrics in The Materials Project database. We use the local symmetry and bond valence sum to determine 147 materials displaying a coexistence of charge order and ferroelectric polarization. Then, ab initio simulations are used to identify 21 charge-order-induced ferroelectric candidates in which the ferroelectric polarization originates from or is structurally coupled to the charge order. For the final 21 candidates, we use symmetry-adapted modes and first-principles calculations to determine the structural coupling term between charge order and polar distortions and compute electronic properties, respectively.</description>

      <title>Determining the complex second-order optical susceptibility in macroscale van der Waals heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the second-order susceptibility in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayers, including their hidden complex phases. To this end, we developed a heterodyne-detection scheme for second-harmonic generation and applied it to macroscale heterobilayer samples prepared using the gold-tape exfoliation method. The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity. The results here provide fundamental quantitative information necessary for the precise design of nanophotonic systems based on stacking engineering.</description>

      <title>Metallic NbS2 one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the experimental realization of metallic NbS2-based one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures applying a modified NaCl-assisted chemical vapor deposition approach. By employing a "remote salt" strategy, precise control over NaCl supply was achieved, enabling the growth of high-quality coaxial NbS2 nanotubes on single-walled carbon nanotube-boron nitride nanotube (SWCNT-BNNT) templates. With the remote salt strategy, the morphologies of as synthesized NbS2 could be controlled from 1D nanotubes to suspended 2D flakes. Structural characterization via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the formation of crystalline NbS2 nanotubes, revealing a distinct bi-layer preference compared to monolayer-dominated semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide analogs. Optical analyses using UV-vis-NIR and FTIR spectroscopy highlight the metallic nature of NbS2. With Raman analysis, oxidation studies demonstrate relative higher degradation rate of 1D NbS2 under ambient conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the stabilization mechanism of bi-layer NbS2 nanotubes, emphasizing interlayer charge transfer and Coulomb interactions. This work establishes a robust framework for synthesizing metallic 1D vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications in optoelectronics and nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films on GaAs (111) substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their topological, thermoelectric, and even ferroelectric properties. We report upon the growth and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films are found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. Remarkably, our 5 nm Bi film demonstrated resilience to ambient conditions without oxidation, with transport properties similar to those of bilayer Bi films grown by confinement heteroepitaxy in other studies. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties.</description>

      <title>$\Sigma$3(111) Grain Boundaries Accelerate Hydrogen Insertion into Palladium Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) are frequently implicated as key defect structures facilitating metal hydride formation, yet their specific role remains poorly understood due to their structural complexity. Here, we investigate hydrogen insertion in Pd nanostructures enriched with well-defined $\Sigma$3(111) GBs (Pd GB) synthesized via electrolysis-driven nanoparticle assembly. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that Pd GB exhibits dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to ligand-free and ligand-capped Pd nanoparticles with similar crystallite sizes. Strain mapping using environmental transmission electron microscopy shows that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along GB sites. Density functional theory calculations support these findings, showing that hydrogen insertion near $\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers. These results provide atomic-level insights into the role of GBs in hydride formation and suggest new design strategies for GB-engineered Pd-based functional materials. Keywords: Hydrogen Insertion; Tensile Strain; Grain Boundaries; Palladium Nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Incipient ionic conductors: Ion-constrained lattices achieving superionic-like thermal conductivity by extreme anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon liquid-like thermal conduction in the solid state enables superionic conductors to serve as efficient thermoelectric device candidates. While liquid-like motion of ions effectively suppresses thermal conductivity (\kappa), their high mobility concurrently triggers material degradation due to undesirable ion migration and consequent metal deposition, making it still a challenge to balancing low \kappa and high stability. Here, we report a superionic-like thermal transport alongside restricted long-range ion migration in CsCu_2I_3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and machine-learning potential-based simulations. We reveal that the Cu ions exhibit confined migration between CuI_4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductorsl. Consequently, a glass-like \kappa (~0.3 W m^{-1} K^{-1} at 300 K) following the relationship of \kappa ~ T^{0.17}, was achieved along the x-direction, where Cu ion migration is three oders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low \kappa and high stability, elucidate the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and pave an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Vacancy-Cluster Interactions and Solute Clustering Kinetics in Al-Mg-Zn Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During heat treatment of age-hardenable alloys, growing solute clusters can strongly trap excess vacancies, limiting their mobility and significantly influencing precipitation kinetics. However, quantitative understanding of vacancy-cluster interactions remains limited due to the inherently multi-time- and multi-length-scale nature of vacancy-mediated diffusion. In this work, we develop an integrated computational framework combining lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, an atomistic absorbing Markov chain model, and mesoscale cluster dynamics (CD) to investigate these interactions and predict their effects on long-time clustering in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. The Markov chain model yields vacancy escape times from solute clusters and identifies a two-stage behavior of the vacancy-cluster binding energy: a size-dependent regime for small clusters (fewer than $\sim$100 atoms), followed by a saturation stage governed by vacancy formation energy differences between the cluster and matrix. These binding energies are used to estimate residual mobile vacancy concentrations in the Al matrix after quenching, which serve as critical inputs to CD simulations to predict the long-time cluster evolution kinetics during natural aging. Our results quantitatively demonstrate that cooling rate substantially affects natural aging kinetics, offering predictive insights for tailoring heat treatments in engineering alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective thermal management at variable and extreme temperatures face limitations for the development of novel energy and aerospace applications. Plasmonic approaches, shown to be capable of tailoring black-body emission, could be effective if materials with high-temperature and tunable plasmonic-resonance were available. Here, we report a synergy between experimental and theoretical results proving that many high-entropy transition-metal carbides, consisting of four or more metals at equal molar ratio, have plasmonic resonance at room, high (&gt;1000C) and variable temperatures. We also found that these high-entropy carbides can be tuned and show considerable plasmonic thermal cycling stability. This paradigm-shift approach could prove quite advantageous as it facilitates the accelerated rational discovery and manufacturability of optically highly-optimized high-entropy carbides with ad-hoc properties.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Barium Hexaferrite Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining unique geometric and magnetic anisotropy in barium hexaferrites has the potential to enhance the performance of advanced technological applications, such as data storage, spintronics, and medicine. Here, we report the synthesis and deposition of barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets, followed by comprehensive structural and magnetic microscopies. The topographic, physical, and morphological properties of individual nanoplatelets, clusters, and aggregates are analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy, while magnetic properties are analysed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Relevant size distributions and nanoparticle configurations for magnetic interactions have been experimentally identified and numerically analyzed. For dense nanoparticle arrangements, direct exchange coupling dominates with parallel magnetisation configuration in overlapping particles. In contrast, separated particles exhibit anti-parallel coupling. Detailed micro-magnetic modelling elucidates the length scales over which these two interaction regimes are dominant, paving the way for macroscopic two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures with tuned magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>AFLOW4: heading toward disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AFLOW4 is the latest iteration of the AFLOW toolkit, specifically tailored to study high-entropy disordered materials. This upgrade includes innovative features like the Soliquidy module, based on the Euclidean transport cost between disordered and ordered material states. AFLOW4 can calculate dielectric functions to understand optical and electronic properties of disordered ceramics. The newly introduced human-readable data export feature ensures the uncomplicated incorporation of AFLOW4 in diverse automated workflows. Features relevant to high-entropy research, like prototype identification, partial occupation method, convex hull calculation, and enthalpy corrections based on local atomic environments, have been improved and exhibit substantial speed-up. Together, these enhancements represent a step forward for AFLOW as a valuable tool for research of high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>Room temperature magnetic vortices in the van der Waals magnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of confinement on the magnetic state of a 12 nm-thick Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We use quantitative scanning NV magnetometry to locally extract the magnetization in rectangular uniformly in-plane magnetized microstructures, showing no enhancement of the Curie temperature compared to magnetization measurements performed before patterning the film, in contrast to previous results obtained on thick Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flakes. Under the application of a weak out-of-plane magnetic field, we observe the stabilization of magnetic vortices at room temperature in micrometric squares. Finally, we highlight the effect of the size of the patterned micro-discs and micro-squares on the stabilization of the vortices using experiments and micromagnetic simulations. Our work thus proposes and demonstrates a way to stabilize non-collinear textures at room temperature in a van der Waals magnets using confinement, although we also show that this approach alone is not successful to enhance the Curie temperature of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ significantly above 300 K.</description>

      <title>Chirality-dependent terahertz topological resonance and inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the terahertz (THz) optical response of magnetic skyrmions governed by an inertial-modified Thiele equation. By incorporating the inertial mass term, we derive analytical expressions for the THz absorption spectrum of skyrmions, revealing a topological resonance phenomenon tunable via the skyrmion's topological charge $Q$, damping factor $\alpha$, and effective mass $m$. The resonance frequency $\omega_0 \propto Q/m$ emerges from the interplay between gyroscopic coupling and inertial mass, enabling precise control over skyrmion dynamics through circularly polarized THz fields. Our results demonstrate that the helical motion trajectories and velocity components of skyrmions depend on the chirality of light and the topological charge $Q$, with critical damping $\alpha_c$ marking the transition to overdamped regimes. Our findings establish an optical method for designing tunable THz devices, such as topological filters and detectors, by exploiting the interplay between magnetic skyrmion topology and the chirality of THz light coupling.</description>

      <title>Effect of alloying additions on the lattice ordering of Ti$_2$AlNb intermetallic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alloys based on the orthorhombic-Ti$_2$AlNb intermetallic phase (O-phase) are promising materials for high-temperature applications in jet engines, given that they can potentially replace Ni-based superalloys in some operating regions of the engines. However, the O-phase is prone to lattice disordering at high temperatures, primarily via anti-site defect formation across the Ti and Nb sites, which can reduce the material's creep resistance and high-temperature tensile properties, necessitating the need to identify strategies to mitigate the disorder. Here, we focus on identifying suitable alloying additions to suppress the disordering of the O-phase using density functional theory and nudged elastic band calculations. Specifically, we consider six different alloying additions, namely, V, Cr, Fe, Mo, Ta, and W, and examine their role in the thermodynamics of anti-site formation and the kinetics of atomic diffusion. Upon verifying the ground state structure and formation energy of Ti$_2$AlNb, we observe the proclivity of all alloying elements (except V) to occupy the Nb site in the O-phase structure. Subsequently, we find that none of the alloying additions can effectively suppress anti-site formation in Ti$_2$AlNb, highlighting the unfavourable thermodynamics. However, we find that Mo and W additions to Ti$_2$AlNb can kinetically suppress the disorder by reducing the diffusivities of Ti and Nb, by $\approx$4$\times$ and 8$\times$ compared to the pristine O-phase, respectively, at an operating temperature of 823 K. Thus, Mo and W additions represent a promising strategy to improve the creep resistance of Ti$_2$AlNb-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Vanadium-doped HfO$_2$, multiferroic uncompromised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio density-functional calculations show that orthorhombic Pca21 hafnia HfO2 mixed with vanadium at low concentration is a ferroelectric and ferromagnetic insulator. The multiorbital degeneracy of singly-occupied V states in the nominally 4+ ionic state is broken by magnetism, reduced symmetry, and local distortion, causing a single one-electron majority state per V atom to be occupied. A gap of order 1 eV thus survives at all V concentrations, and intrinsic polarization is preserved, at the level of two-thirds the hafnia value. Ferromagnetic magnetization is found to increase linearly with V content, with values of 30-40 emu/cm3 at concentrations near the end of the stability range.</description>

      <title>Numerical and data-driven modeling of spall failure in polycrystalline ductile materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.</description>

      <title>Implantation studies of low-energy positive muons in niobium thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we study the range of keV positive muons $\mu^+$ implanted in Nb$_2$O$_5$($x$ nm)/Nb($y$ nm)/SiO$_2$(300 nm)/Si [$x$ = 3.6 nm, 3.3 nm; $y$ = 42.0 nm, 60.1 nm] thin films using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR). At implantation energies 1.3 keV $\leq E \leq$ 23.3 keV, we compare the measured diamagnetic $\mu^+$ signal fraction $f_{\mathrm{dia.}}$ against predictions derived from implantation profile simulations using the TRIM.SP Monte Carlo code. Treating the implanted $\mu^+$ as light protons, we find that simulations making use of updated stopping cross section data are in good agreement with the LE-$\mu$SR measurements, in contrast to parameterizations found in earlier tabulations. Implications for other studies relying on accurate $\mu^+$ stopping information are discussed.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Ordering and Lattice Distortions in Entropy-Stabilized Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), driven by high configurational entropy, have gained phenomenological research interest due to their potential for tailoring structure property relationships. However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>Multicolor groups for molecules and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Just like we classify lions and tigers into the same panthera, but into different species, we can classify molecules and solids by their spatial and spin space symmetries. In magnetic molecules and solids, local moments of the atoms can be represented by different colors; we can therefore classify these materials by playing with colors. The advantage of the multicolor group scheme is that it unifies the classifications into a single framework through multicolor group theory, including the recently identified altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. In particular, non-magnetic compounds fall into 0-color groups, ferro/ferrimagnets fall into 1-color groups, antiferromagnets, as usual, fall into 2-color groups, and non-collinear magnets fall into the simple and complex multicolor groups. Moreover, confusions brought about by conventional magnetic-group classification can be resolved through this new framework.</description>

      <title>TopoMAS: Large Language Model Driven Topological Materials Multiagent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.</description>

      <title>Observation of Momentum-Band Topology in PT-Symmetric acoustic Floquet Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Oxidative Degradation of WSe2 Nanosheets and Its Influence on HER Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.</description>

      <title>Absence of higher than 6-fold coordination in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $&lt;R_{Ge...Ge}&gt;$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Effective behavior of heterogeneous media governed by strain gradient elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, and approximated locally by a fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). We also learn the overall behavior using a Fourier neural operator.</description>

      <title>Orbital mixing as key ingredient for magnetic order in a van der Waals ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights that can be readily generalized to many other low-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Growth and prediction of plastic strain in metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04489v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the interplay between wetting and chemo-mechanical fracture in lithium-ion battery cathode materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crack growth in lithium-ion battery electrodes is typically detrimental and undesirable. However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of cathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically active surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve overall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte wetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic battery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on $\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode materials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\alpha$-V2O5 offers clearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with grain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities on the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical (de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the developed multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay between wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces enhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting influences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance and directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to simulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current (dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture and improving overall capacity. This work bridges fundamental understanding of wetting-fracture coupling with practical implications for battery performance optimization via controlled fracture engineering.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-related short-range order in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels: first principles and cluster expansion study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion resistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical ordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is complex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these alloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin cluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of N on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a strong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and, at higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or N-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO structures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high concentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches its solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of kinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering and offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionic Conductivity along the Coherent $\Sigma$3 Grain Boundary in ThO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries (GBs) is critical for controlling ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics. GBs are typically thought to enhance ionic transport due to structural disorder and increased free volume. In this study, we report an unexpected anomaly: the $\Sigma 3(111)$ GB in thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$), despite its compact and coherent structure, exhibits significantly higher oxygen ionic conductivity compared to the more open GB ($\Sigma 19$ as an example). Using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential, we revealed that the high conductivity in the $\Sigma 3$ GB arises from a collective diffusion mechanism involving highly correlated atomic motion reminiscent of a superionic state. In contrast, the $\Sigma 19$ GB follows conventional pipe diffusion, consistent with its more open structure. This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport. These findings provide new guidance for designing GB-engineered oxides with targeted ionic transport properties for energy applications.</description>

      <title>The size effect on nucleation process during solidification of metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the mechanisms of crystal nucleation in metal melts, in dependence on the influence of their shape and volume. Investigations were conducted on both thin flat and bulk samples prepared of low-temperature Wood's metal alloy and transparent organic media (camphene and diphenylamine). The study revealed that in flat samples, the nucleation rate is primarily influenced by the activity of the mold wall surface, which is affected by melt overheating and subcooling, while in bulk samples, supercooling and nucleation are additionally influenced by factors such as impurity activity, temperature, and density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>DFT-Guided Operando Raman Characterization of Ni-Based Phases Relevant to Electrochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04755v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</description>

      <title>The occupation dependent DFT-1/2 method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a high demand in rectifying the band gap under-estimation problem in density functional theory (DFT), while keeping the computational load at the same level as local density approximation. DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 are useful attempts, as they correct the spurious electron self-interaction through the application of self-energy potentials, which pull down the valence band. Nevertheless, the self-energy potential inevitably disturbs the conduction band, and these two methods fail for semiconductors whose hole and electron are entangled in the same shell-like regions. In this work, we introduce the occupation-dependent DFT-1/2 method, where conduction band states are not subject to the additional self-energy potential disturbance. This methodology works for difficult cases such as $\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cu}_2\text{O}$ and two-dimensional semiconductors. Using a shell-like region for the self-energy potential, and allowing for downscaling of the atomic self-energy potential (with an $A$ &lt; 1 factor), the occupation-dependent shell DFT+$A$-1/2 method yields more accurate conduction band and valence band edge levels for monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$, compared with the computationally demanding hybrid functional approach.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Severe Plastic Deformation of Ceramics by High-Pressure Torsion: Review of Principles and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ceramics are typically brittle at ambient conditions due to their covalent or ionic bonding and limited dislocation activities. While plasticity, and occasionally superplasticity, can be achieved in ceramics at high temperatures through thermally activated phenomena, creep, and grain boundary sliding, their deformation at ambient temperature and pressure remains challenging. Processing under high pressure via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method offers new pathways for severe plastic deformation (SPD) of ceramics. This article reviews recent advances in HPT processing of ceramics, focusing primarily on traditional ceramics (e.g., oxides, carbides, nitrides, oxynitrides) and to a lesser extent advanced ceramics (e.g., silicon, carbon, perovskites, clathrates). Key structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed ceramics are discussed, including phase transformations and the generation of nanograins and defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The properties and applications of these deformed ceramics are summarized, including powder consolidation, photoluminescence, bandgap narrowing, photovoltaics, photocatalysis (dye degradation, plastic waste degradation, antibiotic degradation, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), electrocatalysis, thermoelectric performance, dielectric performance, and ion conductivity for Li-ion batteries. Additionally, the article highlights the role of HPT in synthesizing novel materials, such as high-entropy ceramics (particularly high-entropy oxides), black oxides, and high-pressure polymorphs, which hold promise for energy and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Torsional Behavior of Carbon-Doped Ferrous Nanowires: Atomic-Scale Insights from MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.</description>

      <title>Unlocking high coercivity at room temperature in phase modified MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Stress-induced Martensitic transformation in epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga thin films and its correlation to optical and magneto-optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical and magneto-optical properties of thin epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films, with thicknesses ranging from 8 to 160 nm, were investigated across the spectral range of 0.7-6.4 eV. The films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on MgO substrate with stress-mediating Cr buffer layer. Structural and magnetic characterization revealed an stress-induced martensitic transformation for the films thicker than 80 nm, while thinner films remained in austenite structure deformed by substrate constraint. Both X-type and Y-type twin domains were observed in martensitic samples. Magneto-optical polar Kerr effect spectra showed notable evolution with film thicknesses, demonstrating changes in electronic structure of Ni-Mn-Ga. A combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy allowed for the deduction of the spectral dependence of full permittivity tensor of investigated samples. Three magneto-optical transitions were fitted to the spectra of non-diagonal permittivity using semiclassical theory, showing strong correlations with in-plane coercivity. Observed correlations highlight the impact of substrate-induced strain on Ni-Mn-Ga films and provide insights into the electronic structure changes associated with the martensitic transformation.</description>

      <title>A Pyridyl-Benzimidazole Based Ruthenium(II) Complex as Optical Sensor: Targeted Cyanide Detection and Live Cell Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme toxicity of cyanide (\ce{CN^-}) ions in diverse environmental media has garnered significant attention toward the design of well-organized molecular probes for their selective and sensitive detection. In this context, we present a monometallic Ru(II) complex (Ru-1), based on the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole moiety, acting as a highly selective luminescent probe for \ce{CN^-} recognition in pure water. Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \ce{F^-}, \ce{AcO^-}, and \ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.</description>

      <title>Beyond LSDA and Thomas-Fermi: A Hartree-Fock Analysis of Spherical Nanoparticles in the Jellium Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive Hartree-Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of spherical gold nanoparticles modeled within the jellium approximation is carried out for all systems containing up to 132 delocalized electrons. Emphasis is placed on resolving the energy-level ordering, properly describing the electron density tail and associated charge spill-out, and assessing the accuracy of local exchange and kinetic energy potentials. The calculations are performed on a high-resolution real-space grid to ensure numerical precision. Significant discrepancies are observed between the exchange energy given by the Hartree-Fock approximation and the local spin density approximation (LSDA) in both the inner and outer regions of the nanoparticle. To address these differences, a refined expression of the one-electron exchange energy density as an explicit function of the charge density is proposed. Similarly, the failure of the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy model near the surface of the nanoparticle is resolved by introducing an improved expression for the one-electron kinetic energy density.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Study of the Surface Reconstructions of Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05026v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30{\deg} and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-assisted charge instability in ultrathin RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\'e-assisted electronic surface order.</description>

      <title>Looping metal-support interaction in heterogeneous catalysts during redox reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-support interfaces fundamentally govern the catalytic performance of heterogeneous systems through complex interactions. Here, utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, we uncovered a type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe3O4 catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. At the NiFe-Fe3O4 interfaces, lattice oxygens react with NiFe-activated H atoms, gradually sacrificing themselves and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Meanwhile, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of Fe3O4 support and react with oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe3O4 support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces. Our work provides previously unidentified mechanistic insight into metal-support interactions and underscores the transformative potential of operando methodologies for studying atomic-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Atomistic study of dislocation formation during Ge epitaxy on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate, from an atomistic point of view, the formation of dislocations during the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si. We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition rates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge deposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown film (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface morphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations originate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough Ge film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface, releasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface. Amorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops that propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the dislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding islands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the dislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.</description>

      <title>Variational first-principles approach to self-trapped polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of charge carriers in polar materials is governed by electron-phonon interactions, which affect their mobilities via phonon scattering and may localize carriers into self-induced deformation fields, forming self-trapped polarons. We present a first-principles study of self-trapped polaron formation in paradigmatic polar semiconductors and insulators using the variational polaron equations framework and self-consistent gradient optimization. Our method incorporates long-range corrections to the electron-phonon interaction, essential for finite-size systems. We demonstrate how the variational approach enables the identification of multiple polaronic states and supports the analysis of polarons with arbitrarily large spatial extent via energy filtering. The potential energy surfaces of the resulting polarons exhibit multiple local minima, reflecting distinct, symmetry-broken polaronic configurations in systems with degenerate band edges. Our findings align with previous theoretical studies and establish a robust foundation for future ab initio studies of polarons, especially those employing variational methods.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for the optimization of hafnia-based ferroelectrics through superlattice engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia-based ferroelectrics are revolutionizing the data storage industry and the field of ferroelectrics, with improved materials and devices being reported monthly. However, full understanding and control has not been reached yet and the ideal material still needs to be found. Here we report ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia superlattices made out of zirconium-substituted hafnia (Hf$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$) sublayers of varying stoichiometries alternating with pure ZrO$_2$ sublayers. It is observed that the ZrO$_2$ layers in these superlattices act as a booster for the total remnant polarization (P$_r$). By combining the benefits of the ZrO$_2$ layers and the added interfaces, which help prevent breakdown, we fabricate superlattices with a total 87.5% ZrO$_2$ content, exhibiting record polarizations with a 2P$_r$ value of 84 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ that can be cycled 10$^9$ times, while maintaining a 2P$_r$ &gt; 20 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Next to these attractive properties, substitution of HfO$_2$ by the much more abundant ZrO$_2$ offers a significant step towards the sustainable application of these devices.</description>

      <title>Doping Induced Magnetic and Electronic phase Transition in Ferrimagnetic Half-metallic Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of spintronic and semiconductor applications demands materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties. This study uses density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of the half-metallic compound Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ under uniaxial strain and in its Ge-substituted derivatives. Strain analysis shows that although the half-metallic band-gap collapses under strain beyond $-2\%$, the ferrimagnetic character remains stable. Ge substitution at six inequivalent Al-sites in Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ results in varying degrees of metallicity and magnetic properties. Substitution at Al$=(000)$ induces a metal-to-insulator transition with an indirect semiconducting gap of $0.14~ eV$. Bonding and hybridization analysis reveals that local Mn-Al interactions due to Ge substitution significantly modify the local electronic structure, causing both electronic and magnetic phase transitions. This work highlights the effectiveness of substitutional doping in tuning half-metallicity and magnetic properties in inorganic solids, enabling the design of materials for future technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.</description>

      <title>On the Underlying Mechanism of Light-Induced Patterning of N719-Stained Photoanodes for "Photovoltaic Photographs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, "photovoltaic photographs" were proposed as a creative application of photovoltaic technologies, relevant in fields such as architecture or the automotive industry. In this application an image is created by light-induced patterning of the photoactive layer, causing a local change in the appearance of the solar cell. In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and infrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used to investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the photoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar cells. We show that, for N719 photovoltaic photographs, TiO2 plays a crucial role and that the dye undergoes a multi-step chemical degradation, related to its isothiocyanate ligand. These insights are of importance for a better understanding of the photo-induced degradation of N719, a more substantiated control of the light-induced patterning process, and to design appropriate light-induced patterning techniques for other classes of solar cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Seebeck effect, nonlinear conversion of a temperature gradient into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. Based on a second-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient, $\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300 K, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\nabla T)^2$. We also observed that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length along the $\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law distinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect. We developed a phenomenological model for the nonlinear Seebeck effect incorporating the spin-current induced modulation of the Seebeck coefficient, which well reproduces the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Charge Density Wave and Fermi Surface Reconstruction in Pressurized BaFe2Al9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties associated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW materials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice modulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice strain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further explore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the electrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper insight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW transition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW) shifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the electrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition becomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity indicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under pressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the electrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing pressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi liquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi surface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa, marked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the existence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide valuable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the critical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic ground state.</description>

      <title>Quantized Topological States and Parity Anomaly in Intrinsic Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 offers an exceptional platform for exploring a wide range of topological phenomena. In this work, we overcome longstanding challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport. Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Antiferromagnetic Lifting of Spin-Valley Degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation and control of spin- and valley-polarization in antiferromagnets (AFMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their potential for enabling faster and more stable multifunctional spintronic and valleytronic memory and logic devices. However, the two primary categories of AFMs, altermagnets and TP-symmetric AFMs, either lack intrinsic valley-polarization or net spin-polarization. Here, we propose an effective approach for achieving spontaneous spin-valley polarization in TP-broken layered ferroelectric antiferromagnets (FE-AFMs). The FE-AFMs exhibit lifted spin degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone, along with uncompensated spin density of states. They combine the benefits of spin-polarization in altermagnets with valley-polarization in TP-symmetric AFMs. Furthermore, the FE-AFMs feature layer-dependent spin-polarization, rooted in their intrinsic ferroelectric property, allowing for the flexible control over spin-valley polarization by interlayer sliding. This tunability facilitates sign-reversible and size-tunable valley Hall and Nernst effects, along with other spin-valley-dependent transport properties. Our findings are demonstrated in a broad class of TP-broken bilayer antiferromagnets such as Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I), VX2 (X = S, Se), and VSi2X4 (X = N, P), underscoring the potential of FE-AFMs for advancing next-generation spin- and valley-based information technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Complex Absorbing Potential Green's Function Methods for Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.</description>

      <title>From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a Ce-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c-axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the equilibrium Kauzmann transition in a two-dimensional atomistic glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense liquids gradually transform into non-equilibrium amorphous solids as they pass through the experimental glass transition. Experimentally, ergodicity is lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More than seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments could run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an ergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions represent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously established in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and several idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding in finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical limitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative Kauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing a computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to access the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic glass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This enables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that provide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at a temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is towards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a hierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first demonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical mechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state. We anticipate that our study will serve as a foundation for future simulation work on larger systems, three-dimensional materials, and more complex glass-forming models to fully elucidate the nature of the glass state of matter.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction textures in twisted bilayer graphene from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moir\'e-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new topological phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character, which may explain why superconductivity appears with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.</description>

      <title>Geometric Modeling of a Line of Alternating Disclinations: Application to Grain Boundaries in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.</description>

      <title>Distributed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Large-Scale Electronic Structure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases. However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+ angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to 128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Half-Quantized Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Quantum Size-Dependent Optoelectrical Phenomena in Hot Carrier Quantum Well Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a twisted-Kagome HoAgGe spin ice using Reduced-Configuration-Space Search and Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.</description>

      <title>Spin-split magnon bands induce pure spin current in insulating altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electride-like $s$ States Coexisting with Correlated $d$ Electrons in NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of distinct bulk and edge nonequilibrium spin accumulation in ultrathin MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) topological materials such as MoTe$_2$ host efficient charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) mechanisms that can be harnessed for novel electronic and spintronic devices. However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic correlations in the Kagome metals $RT_3$B$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics. Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.</description>

      <title>The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots as Emerging Optical Sensing Platforms for $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ Detection: Recent Approaches and Perspectives</title>

Abstract: Over the preceding years, nickel (Ni) and its compounds have been increasingly employed in various aspects of human social life, metallurgical/industrial manufactures, healthcare, and chemical processes. Although Ni is considered an essential trace element in biological systems, excessive intake or metabolic deficiency of $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ions may cause detrimental health effects to living organisms. Therefore, a facile and accurate detection of $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$, especially in environmental and biological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method, assaying $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic) sensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of excellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including metal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer distinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic sensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and challenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to selectively detect the $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ion. Emphasis has also been placed on comparing the sensing performance of various nanosensors, along with exploring future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid state in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-like frustrated magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K) between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations, offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.</description>

Abstract: Electronic bridge mechanisms driving the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in the vacuum-ultraviolet-transparent crystals $^{229}$Th:LiCAF (LiCaAlF$_6$) and $^{229}$Th:LiSAF (LiSrAlF$_6$) are investigated theoretically. Due to doping-induced symmetry breaking within the host crystal, electronic defect states emerge around the thorium nucleus and can facilitate nuclear (de)excitation via laser-assisted electronic bridge mechanisms. We investigate spontaneous and laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for different charge compensation mechanisms. While the calculated spontaneous electronic bridge rates are very small, laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for nuclear (de)excitation turn out to be significantly more efficient than both spontaneous nuclear decay and direct laser excitation, offering promising prospects for the future clock operation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Automate Parameter Extraction and Model Fitting of Two-Dimensional Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor &gt;40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.</description>

      <title>Defect-induced displacement of topological surface state in quantum magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface, closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments. Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism. The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic force microscopy versus scanning quantum-vortex microscopy: Probing pinning landscape in granular niobium films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features.
  In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</description>

      <title>Clay metaBrick-based motif to enhance thermal and acoustic insulation</title>

Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials have gained popularity as promising materials for enhancing noise reduction. Here, we explore the use of metamaterials, based on Helmholtz resonators (HRs), to enhance the performance of standard clay hollow brick. By incorporating HRs in the upper and lower hollows, we transform the standard brick into metaBrick, which is essentially designed based on metamaterial principles. We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \si{Hz} and an $8$\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials. These findings indicate that metaBrick is a promising building material, offering improved sound and thermal insulation.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure and Collective Oxygen Transport in the High-Temperature Phase of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crystalline materials, atomic motion is typically confined to vibrations within a fixed lattice, with substantial movement generally associated with defect migration. Here, we report an extraordinary collective ionic transport pathway in the high-temperature tetragonal phase of tantalum pentoxide (H-Ta$_2$O$_5$), whose crystal structure has remained unresolved until now. Our density functional theory calculations unequivocally determine the tetragonal structure to possess a four-fold screw-symmetric configuration derived from the known orthorhombic phase. The proposed structure aligns excellently with experimental lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy observations, resolving longstanding ambiguities regarding the atomic arrangement of H-Ta$_2$O$_5$. Remarkably, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal an unexpected ionic transport mechanism: coordinated, floating-like motion of specific oxygen atoms occurring at temperatures as low as 500 K. This collective oxygen motion beyond simple vibrations occurs within the stoichiometric lattice. The calculated energy barrier is exceptionally low (~0.2 eV), an order of magnitude below typical crystalline diffusion barriers. This drastic barrier reduction arises from flexible lattice coordination around screw-rotation planes, providing extensive positional flexibility and effectively dissipating local charge imbalances near oxygen pathways. Our findings elucidate the intriguing phenomena of intrinsic and anisotropic oxygen conductivity in H-Ta$_2$O$_5$ and offer valuable insights for designing novel crystalline materials with enhanced ionic mobility.</description>

      <title>Strongly Magnetically Tuned Coupling Strength and Nonlinearity in CrSBr Exciton-Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors CrSBr offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, for the exciton-polaritons formed by lower-energy excitons (XL = 1.37 eV), the coupling strength and nonlinear optical response are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate robust strong coupling between higher-energy excitons (XH = 1.8 eV) and photons that persists up to room temperature, along with giant magnetic-field tunability. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, we observe significantly enhanced polariton nonlinearity in the intermediate magnetic phase, which exhibits a distinct mode-number dependence and originates from magnon-assisted long-range attractive interactions and coupling strength reduction. These results advance the development of on-demand polariton platforms for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>The morphology and interface structure of titanium on graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma$5[001] tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma$5 tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon, as validated through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the atoms in the split kite phase demonstrate distinct collective diffusion dynamics. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and stochastic dynamics. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behaviors and solving complex computational problems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of volatile resistive switching devices and neuronal oscillators based on three representative materials with coincident electronic and structural phase transitions, at different levels of technological readiness: the well-studied correlated oxide VO2, the charge-density-wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progresses from the perspective of materials development and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning foundation models of materials interatomic potentials with frozen transfer learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of functionalized magnetite surfaces with oxidation states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms, scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. Charge neutrality is ensured by the oxidation of Fe ions. The MC approach allows magnetite to adapt to its environment at interfaces without requiring interface-specific rescaling of force-field parameters. This enables a simple, versatile method. By comparing adsorption sites, layer distances, and bond lengths with results from electronic structure calculations and experiments, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution and, consequently, binding site preference depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method ensures seamless compatibility with popular biomolecular force fields providing transferability and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.</description>

      <title>Electrons and phonons in pentacene, insights from comparison between experiment and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive computational study of the vibrational properties and electron-phonon couplings in the three known polymorphs of pentacene. Vibrational patterns and electron-phonon interactions were calculated at several q-points of the Brillouin zone, allowing for a detailed mapping of the phonon landscape and the associated coupling mechanisms relevant to charge transport. Using a pool of post-processing tools, we analyze the different phonon dispersions. Thus, we shed light on how low-frequency phonons modulate the transport differently in the polymorphs via their distinct electron-phonon coupling (EPC) signatures in reciprocal space. In fact, we show that distinct phonons dominate in high-temperature and thin-film polymorphs with respect to the high mobility low-temperature polymorph, and that these lead to different decoherence/localization trends. We describe the microscopic origin of the mobility in bulk polymorph, demonstrating that polymorphism not only modulates the transfer integral but also the phonon pattern. For the first time we show that different EPC patterns lead to very different mobility values even in similar structures. Also, we explain how phonon confinement is responsible for the increased mobility observed in 2D phase. Finally, we address the problem of possible coexistence of multiple polymorphs within a single specimen, frequently encountered in organic crystals due to their subtle energy landscape and processing conditions. In this context, we consider the implications of polymorph intergrowth, structural defects and disorder.</description>

      <title>BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals, with a PL quantum yield of $\sim$0.005\%. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and nontrivial electron-phonon interactions contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Design of Interstitial Oxygen Conductors</title>

Abstract: Highly efficient oxygen active materials that react with, absorb, and transport oxygen is essential for fuel cells, electrolyzers and related applications. While vacancy mediated oxygen ion conductors have long been the focus of research, they are limited by high migration barriers at intermediate temperatures, which hinder their practical applications. In contrast, interstitial oxygen conductors exhibit significantly lower migration barriers enabling faster ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. This review systematically examines both well established and recently identified families of interstitial oxygen ion conductors, focusing on how their unique structural motifs such as corner sharing polyhedral frameworks, isolated polyhedral, and cage like architectures, facilitate low migration barriers through interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion mechanisms. A central discussion of this review focuses on the evolution of design strategies, from targeted donor doping, element screening, and physical intuition descriptor material discovery, which leverage computational tools to explore vast chemical spaces in search of new interstitial conductors. The success of these strategies demonstrates that a significant, largely unexplored space remains for discovering high performing interstitial oxygen conductors. Crucial features enabling high performance interstitial oxygen diffusion include the availability of electrons for oxygen reduction and sufficient structural flexibility with accessible volume for interstitial accommodation. This review concludes with a forward looking perspective, proposing a knowledge driven methodology that integrates current understanding with data centric approaches to identify promising interstitial oxygen conductors outside traditional search paradigms.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced power-law scaling in martensites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of TWIP and TRIP effects in $\beta$-Ti alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformations in bcc-$\beta$, hcp-$\alpha$, and the $\omega$ phases of Ti alloys are studied using Density Functional Theory for pure Ti and Ti alloyed with Al, Si, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Nb, Mo, and Sn. The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of neutron irradiation on Caesium Lead Bromide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structure and carrier-scattering property of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.</description>

      <title>Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of FeNi and FeCo along the Bain path</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.</description>

      <title>About the Strain-Coupled Molecular Dynamics in the Ferroelastic Phase Transition of TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce N\'eel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</description>

Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated N\'eel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</description>

      <title>Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $\alpha$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500{\deg}C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Visualization of defect-induced interband proximity effect at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature $T_C$, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to interband scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multiband superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by interband scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying crystallographic defects in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune interband coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters from two well separated gaps to one merged gap around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multiband superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice entanglement in $\mathbf{CoPS}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</description>
