      <title>PRIMRose: Insights into the Per-Residue Energy Metrics of Proteins with Double InDel Mutations using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein structure is essential for advancements in computational biology and bioinformatics. We introduce PRIMRose, a novel approach that predicts energy values for each residue given a mutated protein sequence. Unlike previous models that assess global energy shifts, our method analyzes the localized energetic impact of double amino acid insertions or deletions (InDels) at the individual residue level, enabling residue-specific insights into structural and functional disruption. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict the energy changes of each residue in a protein mutation. We train our model on datasets constructed from nine proteins, grouped into three categories: one set with exhaustive double InDel mutations, another with approximately 145k randomly sampled double InDel mutations, and a third with approximately 80k randomly sampled double InDel mutations. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across a range of energy metrics as calculated by the Rosetta molecular modeling suite and reveals localized patterns that influence model performance, such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure context. This per-residue analysis offers new insights into the mutational tolerance of specific regions within proteins and provides higher interpretable and biologically meaningful predictions of InDels' effects.</description>

      <title>On fine-tuning Boltz-2 for protein-protein affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-protein binding affinity is vital for understanding molecular interactions and designing therapeutics. We adapt Boltz-2, a state-of-the-art structure-based protein-ligand affinity predictor, for protein-protein affinity regression and evaluate it on two datasets, TCR3d and PPB-affinity. Despite high structural accuracy, Boltz-2-PPI underperforms relative to sequence-based alternatives in both small- and larger-scale data regimes. Combining embeddings from Boltz-2-PPI with sequence-based embeddings yields complementary improvements, particularly for weaker sequence models, suggesting different signals are learned by sequence- and structure-based models. Our results echo known biases associated with training with structural data and suggest that current structure-based representations are not primed for performant affinity prediction.</description>

      <title>Mapping Still Matters: Coarse-Graining with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07692v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.</description>

      <title>Look the Other Way: Designing 'Positive' Molecules with Negative Data via Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., `positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' - without accessing any positively labeled data - and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 33 design experiments with distinct molecular entities (small molecules, proteins), model architectures, and scales, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules in general. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable complex design properties, such as good docking scores to a protein. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the de facto transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.</description>
