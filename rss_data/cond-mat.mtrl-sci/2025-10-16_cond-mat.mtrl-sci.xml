      <title>Emergent spin Hall quantization and high-order van Hove singularities in square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are versatile platforms for exploring exotic quantum phases, especially when combined with high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that enhance electron correlations. However, perfect spin Hall quantization is often hindered by spin mixing from strong spin-orbit coupling, and the emergence of such VHSs is highly sensitive to material-specific electronic structures. Here, we predict a class of seven-layered square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo/W, A = Si/Ge, Z = Pnictogen) isomers that host a robust, large-gap QSH phase with nearly quantized spin Hall conductivity and intrinsic high-order VHSs. Topological and symmetry analyses reveal that compounds with Z = P, As, and Sb are $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nontrivial with spin Chern number $C_s = 1$ and support $S_z$-polarized edge states, while those with Z = N are trivial insulators. The QSH phase features an $S_z$-conserving spin Hamiltonian consistent with an emergent spin $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quasi-symmetry, yielding spin Hall conductivity $\sim 2e^2/h$. Notably, MA$_2$(As, Sb)$_4$ compounds exhibit quasi-flat bands near the Fermi level in the inverted regime, with WSi$_2$Sb$_4$ additionally hosting four high-order VHSs at generic momentum points. These results position square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials as robust QSH insulators for realizing quantized spin Hall conductivity and correlated topological phases, including fractionalized states and possibly non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Photostriction-Driven Phase Transition in Layered Chiral NbOX$_2$ Crystals: Electrical-Field-Controlled Enantiomer Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals offer an unique platform for controlling structural handedness through external stimuli. However, the ability to select between structural enantiomers remains challenging, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we demonstrate a two-step pathway for enantiomer selectivity in layered chiral NbOX$_2$ (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals based on photostriction-driven phase transitions. Ab-initio simulations reveal that optical excitation is capable of inducing a structural phase transition in NbOX$_2$ from the monoclinic ($C2$) ground state to the higher-symmetry ($C2/m$) structure. In the resulting transient high-symmetry state, an applied electric field breaks the residual inversion-symmetry degeneracy, selectively stabilizing one enantiomeric final state configuration over the other. Our results establish a combined optical-electrical control scheme for chiral materials, enabling reversible and non-contact enantiomer selection with potential applications in ultrafast switching, optoelectronics, and chiral information storage.</description>

      <title>Emergent domain topology in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent topological phenomena in multiferroic materials arise from the intricate coupling between structural, electric, and magnetic order parameters. Hexagonal manganites provide a paradigmatic platform for such studies. These compounds exhibit a strongly coupled distortive-improper ferroelectric order, arising from trimerizing lattice distortions, and a 120{\deg} noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure. While their two-dimensional domain topology has been extensively studied, the full three-dimensional multiferroic domain architecture has remained largely unexplored, mainly due to the experimental challenges of probing bulk structures beyond surfaces. Here, we employ a Landau free-energy framework combined with large-scale phase-field simulations to reveal the intricate three-dimensional multiferroic domain network of hexagonal manganites. We demonstrate that the coupling between the structural and antiferromagnetic order parameters gives rise to a rich variety of three-dimensional topological features. In particular, these features give rise to an attraction between different types of domain walls. Moreover, we identify bifurcations of vortex-like lines at domain-wall intersections, a phenomenon that can exist only in three dimensions and fundamentally alters the topology of the domain network. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for understanding three-dimensional domain interactions in multiferroics and highlight the essential role of dimensionality in coupling improper ferroelectricity, magnetism, and topology in hexagonal manganites.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

      <title>First-Principles Exploration of Pentagonal TiN$_8$ and MoN$_8$ Monolayers as New Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for robust, intrinsically magnetic topological materials exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and the application of revolutionary electronics. However, progress has been hampered by the limited number of candidate materials, which often suffer from poor stability and complex synthesis. Here, we introduce a new paradigm by exploring the emergent magnetism and nontrivial band topology in the largely overlooked family of two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal MN$_8$ monolayers. Employing first-principles calculations, we reveal that these systems host out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground states, a key feature that unlocks nontrivial topological properties driven by the localized $d$-orbitals of the embedded transition metals. Remarkably, we identify TiN$_8$ as a QAH insulator characterized by a Chern number of $C=-1$. Even more strikingly, MoN$_8$ is predicted to be a rare high-Chern-number QAH insulator, boasting a Chern number of $C=2$. Our findings establish the penta-MN$_8$ family as a fertile and versatile platform for realizing exotic topological quantum states. This work not only significantly expands the material landscape for magnetic topological insulators but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for designing next-generation spintronic and quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Energetic Origins of Competing Deformation Modes in Metastable Titanium Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable alloys, such as $\beta$-phase titanium (Ti) alloys with a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties through the interplay of multiple deformation mechanisms -- diffusionless phase transformations, deformation twinning, and conventional dislocation slip. However, understanding how these mechanisms compete or cooperate across a wide range of metastable alloys and loading conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the nucleation behavior of competing deformation modes in metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys as a function of temperature, composition, and loading conditions. We reveal that twinning pathways emerge through reversible transformations between the $\beta$ phase and the orthorhombic $\alpha"$ phase, in agreement with crystallographic theories. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that the dominant deformation mechanisms and preferred twinning-plane orientations are governed by two key energetic parameters: the free energy barrier for homogeneous $\beta \leftrightarrow \alpha"$ transformations and the misfit strain energy along specific phase boundaries. These energetic quantities vary systematically with thermodynamic and mechanical conditions, thereby rationalizing the deformation mode transitions observed in both simulations and experiments. These energetic metrics offer a physically grounded and computationally tractable basis for designing next-generation metastable alloys.</description>

      <title>Melting phase relation of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 determined by machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica (SiO2) is fundamental to both industrial technology and planetary science, yet the phase relations of its high-pressure polymorphs remain poorly constrained. Here, we develop two machine learning potentials (MLPs) for SiO2 that faithfully represent the SCAN and PBEsol exchange-correlation functionals over a wide temperature (1000-10000 K) and pressure (100-400 GPa) range using deep neural networks. With large-scale two-phase simulations powered by these potentials, we determine the melting curves of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 and infer the solid-solid phase boundary between these two phases. The SCAN functional, which captures intermediate-range van der Waals interactions, reproduces structural and thermodynamic properties with high fidelity, predicting melting temperatures 6-10 % higher and a seifertite to pyrite-type transition pressure 22 % higher than the PBEsol. The strongly negative Clapeyron slope (-6.1 MPa/K) of this transition suggests that mantle convection could be highly layered in super-Earth exoplanets, potentially affecting their long-term thermal evolution and habitability.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Electrical Properties of (Cr,Mo,Ta,V,W)C High-Entropy Carbide Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis and characterization, along with the resulting properties, of fully dense \((\mathrm{Cr, Mo, Ta, V, W})\mathrm{C}\) high-entropy carbide ceramics were studied. The ceramics were synthesized from metal oxide and carbon powders by carbothermal reduction, followed by spark plasma sintering at various temperatures for densification. Increasing the densification temperature resulted in grain growth and an increase in the lattice parameter. Thermal diffusivity increased linearly with testing temperature, resulting in thermal conductivity values ranging from approximately \(7~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}\) at room temperature to \(12~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}\) at \(200~^\circ\mathrm{C}\). Measured heat capacity values matched theoretical estimates made using the Neumann--Kopp rule. Room-temperature electrical resistivity decreased from \(137\) to \(120~\mu\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}\) as the excess carbon decreased from \(5.4\) to \(0.1~\mathrm{vol\%}\), suggesting an enhanced electronic contribution to thermal conductivity as excess carbon decreased. All specimens exhibited a Vickers hardness of approximately \(29~\mathrm{GPa}\) under a \(0.49~\mathrm{N}\) load. These results underscore the tunability of this high-entropy carbide system.</description>

      <title>The nature of polar distortions in ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar distortion, the collective off-center displacements of atoms, is a fingerprint of a ferroelectric that governs its properties and functionalities. Since the 1970s, the concepts of proper, improper and triggered ferroelectrics have been established to shed light on a diversity of polar distortion mechanisms. Such concepts assign a single nature to polar distortion and are helpful to interpret how polar distortions occur in conventional ferroelectrics such as barium titanate. However, applying these concepts to complex ferroelectrics (e.g., polar orthorhombic hafnia) is notoriously challenging and can yield highly controversial arguments. Here we resolve this issue by developing a tailor-made graph theory for clarifying the nature of polar distortions in complex ferroelectrics, which emphasizes that polar distortions in such ferroelectrics usually exhibit multiple natures among proper, improper and triggered characteristics. We demonstrate the robustness of our theory by working with perovsktie superlattices and polar orthorhombic hafnia (i.e., two representative cases). We successfully identify the mixed proper-improper nature in perovsktite superlattices and reconcile the controversy on polar orthorhombic hafnia by confirming its mixed trigger-improper nature. Our work will definitely lead to a revisitation of concepts in ferroelectric physics and provide opportunities for discovering novel ferroelectrics and related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Material Property Prediction with Deep Learning and Single-Descriptor electronic Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its high scalability and computational efficiency, machine learning methods have been increasingly integrated into various scientific research domains, including ab initio-based materials design. It has been demonstrated that, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict material properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the most significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of machine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is typically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation is rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple degrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and electrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum states of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules out the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full description of these critical quantities. In this paper, we develop a universal machine learning framework based solely on a physically grounded and theoretically rigorous descriptor -- electronic charge density. Our framework not only enables accurate prediction of eight different material properties (with R$^2$ values up to 0.94), but also demonstrates outstanding multi-task learning capability, as prediction accuracy improves when more target properties are incorporated into a single training process, thereby indicating excellent transferability. These results represent a significant step toward realizing the long-standing goal of a universal machine learning framework for the unified prediction of all material properties.</description>

      <title>Colossal Cryogenic Electro-Optic Response Through Metastability in Strained BaTiO$_{3}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for thin film electro-optic (EO) materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear EO coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to ~200 pm V$^{-1}$ in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior EO properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low-temperature EO response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low-symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive EO response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain-tuned BaTiO$_{3}$ thin film that exhibits a linear EO coefficient of 2516 +/- 100 pm V$^{-1}$ at 5 K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the EO coefficient increases by 100x during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order EO responses also emerge. These results represent a new framework for designing materials with property enhancements by stabilizing highly tunable metastable phases with strain.

      <title>Surface Properties of Ga-Cu Based Liquid-Metal Alloys: Impact of Cu Dilution Topography and Reaction Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, a promising material system for supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS). The impact of Cu dilution in the (liquid) Ga matrix is in-detail investigated by X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations. With decreasing Cu content, microscopic and macroscopic Ga-Cu model samples exhibit a shift of the Cu 2p core level line to higher binding energies (Eb) as well as a correspondingly shifted and narrowed d-band with respect to pure Cu, which we ascribe to site isolation. To study the property evolution of Ga-Cu at SCALMS reaction conditions, i.e., where Cu is present in liquid Ga, additional XPS measurements were performed between 100 and 500 oC. The observed Cu 2p shift to lower Eb is tentatively ascribed to changes in the local environment with increasing temperature, i.e. bond elongation, which is corroborated by ML-FF simulations. The increased Cu surface content at low temperatures is attributed to the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy images. In an attempt to generalize the findings for filled d-band transition metals (TMs) in liquid Ga also Ga-Ag and Ga-Au model systems were investigated. The observed insights may be another step of paving the way for an insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Isothermal Annealing Effects on $\beta$-Relaxations and Crystallization Behaviors in Amorphous GeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A secondary $\beta$-relaxation process is often the dominant source of atomic dynamics below $T_\mathrm{g}$ in many glass forming systems. Recent studies reported the presence of $\beta$-relaxations in amorphous phase-change materials (PCMs) and showed that suppressing the $\beta$-relaxation via annealing in Ge$_{15}$Sb$_{85}$ can effectively slow down its crystallization kinetics. Yet, when Sb is replaced by Te, similar annealing protocol has little effect on the Te-rich alloy Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Here, we investigate amorphous GeTe that is a Sb-free PCM, but with faster crystallization kinetics than Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Using powder mechanical dynamic spectroscopy, we observe a clear reduction of the excess-wing in the loss modulus upon isothermal annealing, indicating a suppression of its $\beta$-relaxation. Ultrafast calorimetric analysis and time-resolved optical reflectivity measurements show that, whereas as-deposited GeTe exhibit stochastic crystallization behaviors, annealed samples crystallize more slowly with reduced stochasticity. Synchrotron X-ray scattering experiments reveal reinforced Peierls-like distortions in the amorphous structure after annealing, and demonstrate that, even if annealing introduces nucleation sites, it nonetheless slows down crystallization kinetics. These finding suggests that, in annealed GeTe, crystallization is limited by crystal growth rate, which is retarded through the suppression of $\beta$-relaxation.</description>

      <title>Tuning the non-linear interactions of hybrid interlayer excitons in bilayer MoS2 via electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid interlayer excitons in bilayer MoS2 are a promising platform for nonlinear optics due to their intrinsic dipolar character, which combines in-plane and out-ofplane dipole moments. In this work, we directly probe the nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions of hybrid interlayer excitons. By applying an external out-of-plane electric field, we polarize the excitons to enhance their mutual dipolar interactions, thereby deliberately favoring these repulsive contributions over competing attractive manybody corrections. We furthermore establish a fully microscopic theoretical description of these effects to explain the core experimental results. The tuning results in a significantly larger blueshift compared to the zero-field case and perspectively opens an avenue to even switch between repulsive and attractive interaction potentials. Our findings establish that strong nonlinearities can be tuned via an external electric field, providing a new degree of control over exciton interactions beyond density tuning alone.</description>

      <title>Angular Emission Properties of Strained Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides have shown that uniaxial strain changes both the photoluminescence emission energy and intensity. The changes are attributed to the band-structure evolution under tensile strain where both the bandgap decreases and a direct-to-indirect transition occurs. This was shown for relatively high strains, whereas this is not the case at low strain values $&lt;1\%$ in which in this work, we observe the erratic dependency of the photoluminescence intensity at low strain values as a function of strain. We find that the dominant physical property is the dependence of the optical-dipole emission on the curvature of the substrate. We validate the behavior of the photoluminescence intensity with experimental angular emission spectroscopy (k-space imaging). These findings are supported by Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, in agreement with the experimental data. Our findings present the importance of choosing the right substrate for flexible devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Integration of imprint-free and low coercivity ferroelectric BaTiO3 thin films on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-crystalline ferroelectric oxides integrated on Si hold great promise for energy-efficient memory and logic technologies. Exploiting epitaxial strain engineering in these materials is, however, severely hampered on Si, where the large structural mismatch often results in an inferior interfacial quality and causes a degradation of the ferroelectric switching characteristics. In this work, we present the growth of single-crystalline BaTiO3 thin films on Si, exhibiting imprint-free switching, low coercivity, high remanent polarization, and no fatigue for over $10^{10}$ switching cycles. We accomplish this via the insertion of a SrSn1-xTixO3 layer on SrTiO3-buffered Si. This layer serves as a pseudo substrate that alleviates the thermal strain that the Si substrates imposes on the BaTiO3 layer, while simultaneously providing moderate compressive strain that stabilizes a pure out-of-plane polarization. Thus, our work paves the way toward the fabrication of Si-compatible, low-power-consuming ferroelectric devices for non-volatile memory applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Insights into Defect Induced Modulation in Electronic Properties of 2D Nitride Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nitride materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$), and beryllonitrene (BeN$_4$) have emerged as promising candidates for next generation electronic, optoelectronic, and energy applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. This study presents a systematic investigation of the effects of vacancy defect, specifically the role of nitrogen and constituent atom vacancies on the electronic properties of these materials. Our findings reveal that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies significantly alters the electronic characteristics of these materials. In h-BN, the presence of a nitrogen monovacancy significantly lowers the work function from 5.97 eV to 3.45 eV, one of the lowest values reported for any 2D material. Additionally, this defect reduces the band gap from 4.6 eV to 0.64 eV, driving the material toward half-metallic behavior. This is accompanied by the emergence of flat bands near the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron-electron interactions. In g-C$_3$N$_4$, nitrogen vacancies lead to a decrease in work function and band gap, with double nitrogen vacancies rendering the material nearly metallic. In BeN$_4$, nitrogen vacancies result in minimal charge redistribution and a slight increase in work function, highlighting the material's unique electronic behavior. These results underscore the potential of vacancy engineering in tuning the electronic properties of 2D nitride materials, offering avenues for the design of materials with tailored work functions and band gaps for applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Corrosion Mechanism of Boro-Alumino-Phospho-Silicate Glass: Advanced Insights from Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrosion mechanism of minerals and glass is a critical study domain in geology and materials science, vital for comprehending material durability under various environmental conditions. Despite decades of extensive study, a core aspect of these mechanisms - specifically, the formation of amorphous alteration layers upon exposure to aqueous environments - remains controversial. In this study, the corrosion behavior of a boro-alumino-phospho-silicate glass (BAPS) was investigated using advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and SEM techniques. The results reveal a uniform nanoscale phase separation into Al-P-rich and Al-Si-rich domains. During corrosion, the Al-P-rich domain undergoes gelation, whereas the Al-Si-rich domain remains vitreous, forming a gel layer comprised of both phases. Although SEM images show a sharp gel/glass interface - suggestive of a dissolution-precipitation mechanism - the phase coexistence within the gel layer provides definitive evidence against such a mechanism. Instead, we propose an in situ transformation mechanism governed by chemical reactions, involving: (i) preferential hydrolysis of Al-P-rich domain leading to porous gel regions; (ii) retention of Al-Si glass domains within the gel layer, with water infiltrating inter-network spaces; and (iii) selective leaching of phosphorus over aluminum, leading to reorganization of the gel network.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast exciton polaron dynamics in 2D Ruddlesden Popper lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper (2D) RP hybrid perovskites exhibit substantially higher chemical and structural stability than their three dimensional (3D) counterparts, positioning them as promising candidates for next generation optoelectronics. While quasiparticle dynamics in 3D perovskites are well studied, their 2D analogues remain comparatively underexplored. Here we systematically investigate the branching, dynamics, and interactions of free excitons (FEs) and exciton polarons EPs in monolayer 2D RP perovskites using visible range femtosecond transient absorption TA spectroscopy. We prepared monolayer 2D RP perovskite thin films with varied organic spacers and distinct fabrication routes for comparative analysis. We find that the EP binding energy is 50 65 meV in (BA)2PbI4 and 37 39 meV in (PEA)2PbI4, consistent with spacer layer dependent coupling as corroborated by FTIR. We reveal a dynamic equilibrium between FEs and EPs that persists for tens of picoseconds. Notably, the TA signatures differ by fabrication route films from the newly developed process show weaker Auger annihilation and a reduced hot phonon bottleneck than those from the conventional route trends consistent with fewer traps and impurities in the former. Coupled rate equation modeling reproduces the transients and quantifies the processes of hot carrier relaxation, exciton exciton annihilation, exciton phonon coupling, and FE EP interconversion. These results demonstrate that the chemical synthetic process (fabrication route) and spacer choice significantly influence EP stability and population balance, offering practical levers for engineering ultrafast photophysics in 2D perovskites and guiding the design of advanced optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Moir\'e Reconstruction and Memorization in Two-Dimensional Materials without Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a twist between layers exhibit a moir\'e interference pattern with larger periodicity than any of the constituent layer unit cells. In these systems, a wealth of exotic phases appear that result from moir\'e-dependent many-body electron correlation effects or non-trivial band topology. One problem with using twist to generate moir\'e interference has been the difficulty in creating high-quality, uniform, and repeatable samples due to fabrication through mechanical stacking with viscoelastic stamps. Here we show, a new method to generate moir\'e interference through the controlled application of layer-by-layer strain (heterostrain) on non-twisted 2D materials, where moir\'e interference results from strain-induced lattice mismatch without twisting or stacking. Heterostrain generation is achieved by depositing stressed thin films onto 2D materials to apply large strains to the top layers while leaving layers further down less strained. We achieve deterministic control of moir\'e periodicity and symmetry in non-twisted 2D multilayers and bilayers, with 97% yield, through varying stressor film force (film thickness X film stress) and geometry. Moir\'e reconstruction effects are memorized after the removal of the stressor layers. Control over the strain degree-of-freedom opens the door to a completely unexplored set of unrealized tunable moir\'e geometric symmetries, which may now be achieved in a high-yield and user-skill independent process taking only hours. This technique solves a long-standing throughput bottleneck in new moir\'e quantum materials discovery and opens the door to industrially-compatible manufacturing for 2D moir\'e-based electronic or optical devices.</description>

      <title>Scalable and deterministic construction of moir\'e superlattice in 2D materials using stressor films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice in two-dimensional (2D) materials provides a powerful platform to engineer emergent electronic states, yet the construction of moir\'e superlattices remains lab-scale, involving much trial and error and with little control. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a heterostrain-induced moir\'e superlattice in transition metal dichalcogenides using a scalable process that deterministically induces strain to 2D materials. By applying patterned thin-film stressors and probing the resulting structures with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly resolve the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produce the moir\'e superlattice. We find that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain give rise to distinct moir\'e patterns, including stripes and distorted hexagonal patterns. With this approach, we create in-plane polar distortions and thus in-plane polarization at the domain boundaries of the moir\'e superlattice in MoS$_2$. The deterministic and scalable construction of moir\'e patterns using a well-established scalable process opens opportunities to design new moir\'e geometries in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Resonant diffraction and photoemission inconsistent with altermagnetism in epitaxial RuO$_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitement about the magnetic and electronic properties of RuO$_2$ is growing, fueled by reports of antiferromagnetism, strain-induced superconductivity, and its recent classification as a member of a newly proposed magnetic class, altermagnets, with RuO$_2$ widely regarded as the paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ remains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of magnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic scattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on the (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states. Leveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally forbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of colinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering signal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge scattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic band splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly, anisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The combination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Structure and magnetism of MnGe thin films grown with a non-magnetic CrSi template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a novel method to grow B20 MnGe thin films which employs an ultrathin CrSi template layer on Si(111). This layer is expected to be non-magnetic, in contrast to MnSi and FeGe buffer layers that have been used previously, allowing an investigation of the intrinsic properties the MnGe in the ultrathin film limit without the influence of a neighboring magnetic layer. Single-phase MnGe(111) films were grown with thicknesses between 2 and 40 nm, which exhibited low interfacial roughnesses on the order of 0.6 nm. The films crystallized in a B20 structure with a small rhombohedral distortion. Magnetometry measurements in out-of-plane fields are consistent with a conical state. However, an unexpected remanent moment develops below 35 K, concomitant with features in the field dependence of the transport data. This provides indirect evidence for the presence of a low-temperature phase which has been identified by others as either a triple-Q topological spin-hedgehog lattice, or a multi-domain single-Q conical state.</description>

      <title>Scalable covalently functionalized black phosphorus hybrids for broadspectrum virucidal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the onset of viral outbreaks, broad-spectrum antiviral materials are crucial before specific therapeutics become available. We report scalable, biodegradable black phosphorus (BP) hybrids that provide mutation-resilient virucidal protection. BP sheets, produced via an optimized mechanochemical process, are covalently functionalized with 2-azido-4,6-dichloro- 1,3,5-triazine to form P=N bonds. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide with intrinsic antiviral activity, and hydrophobic chains are then incorporated to achieve irreversible viral deactivation. The material exhibits strong antiviral inhibition and complete virucidal activity against multiple viruses, including recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. It maintains high biocompatibility, remains effective against viral mutations, and is shelf stable for at least five month. The combination of biodegradability, scalable synthesis, and synergistic antiviral and virucidal mechanisms establishes BP-conjugates as a new class of highly efficient antivirals. They offer a broad spectrum antiviral solutions that could bridge the gap between antiviral medicines and general antiseptics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</description>

      <title>Exotic Surface Stripe Orders in Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0 stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system.</description>

      <title>Time is length in self-similar logarithmic aging of physically cross-linked semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical aging in polymers is a fundamental yet poorly understood phenomenon, as diverse macromolecular systems exhibit remarkably similar slow dynamics. Through molecular dynamics simulations of physically crosslinked networks composed of semiflexible polymers, we identify a previously unexplored class of self-similar aging. The network undergoes ultra-slow coarsening characterized by a logarithmically growing mesh size, $L(t)\sim \ln t$, which governs the spatial organization, cohesive and bending energies, and the aging dynamics of the system. This single time-dependent length scale defines an internal clock, giving rise to spatio- temporal self-similarity of both structure and dynamics - offering a perspective on aging in soft and disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry and strong second harmonic generation with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transitions Beyond the Nanoscale in Pressurized Silica Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth's interior. While pressure-induced changes in the short-range structure - particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry - have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to $P \approx 100$~GPa. Using a novel many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for $P \lesssim 10$~GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher $P$s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The $P$-dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Spin-Selective Second-Order Topological Insulators Enabling Cornertronics in 2D Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs) opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</description>

      <title>GO-Diff: Data-free and amortized global structure optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GO-Diff, a diffusion-based method for global structure optimization that learns to directly sample low-energy atomic configurations without requiring prior data or explicit relaxation. GO-Diff is trained from scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from scratch.</description>

      <title>Magnetically controllable nonlinear valley Hall effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley Hall effect is fundamental to valleytronics and provides a promising avenue for advancing information technology. While conventional valley Hall effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition driven by competing charge-order fluctuations in 1T'-TaTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, characterized by a discontinuous change in the order parameter, are intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \frac{1}{4}+\delta, \frac{1}{2})$ in the 1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta trimer bonding states at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO} =(0, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden incommensurability of the $\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding. Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at $\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a field-induced Lifshitz transition in the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetal CeAlSi crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal space group $I4_1md$ and exhibits ferromagnetic order below 8 K, thereby breaking both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This unique combination of properties establishes CeAlSi as a model system for studying the interplay between non-trivial topological states and strong electron correlations. In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an important role.</description>

      <title>A continuous invariant-based asymmetry of a crystal quantifies its deviation from higher symmetry Z'=1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many crystals are highly symmetric only at some approximation because of experimental noise. In the past, deviations from symmetry in a periodic crystal were quantified by the number Z', which discretely counts geometrically non-equivalent formula units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetric form in physically meaningful Angstroms. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction landscapes show that many simulated crystals can be filtered out as non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high values of the CIA, which is much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be almost symmetric due to low values of the CIA.</description>

Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_3$ (LAO), an archetypal quantum material for its electronic and structural properties. Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description>

      <title>Transition from antiferromagnets to altermagnets: Symmetry-Breaking Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the similarity of the real-space configurations for the opposite spin sublattices in both antiferromagnets (AFM) and altermagnets (AM), the relationship between them should be profound. In this work, we demonstrate that AFM and AM can be connected with spin groups and their subgroups. Consequently, the breaking of the combined inversion or translation operation with time-reversal symmetry (PT or tT) in AFM will induce transition from AFM to AM. We systematically list all collinear spin point groups and space groups that can realize the transition for the three types of AFMs: PT-type, tT-type and PT-tT-type. Moreover, we propose that Floquet engineering using circularly polarized light and surface cutting engineering are effective approaches to break PT and tT symmetries of AFM, respectively, achieving the transition. Interestingly, the features and magnitude of altermagnetic spin splitting can be tuned by adjusting various parameters of Floquet engineering. Our work not only establishes a theoretical framework for the transition from AFM to AM, but also provides practical approaches utilizing the achievements in AFM for a hundred years to obtain AM, significantly expanding the scope of altermagnetic materials for both theoretical studies and future practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</description>

Abstract: The QS$GW$ method is used to study the electronic band structure, optical dielectric function, and exchange interactions in chalcopyrite, $I\bar{4}2d$, structure MnGeP$_2$. The material is found to be an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with the lowest direct gap of 2.44 eV at the $\Gamma$ point and an indirect gap of 1.87 eV. The material is an altermagnet, with the two magnetic atoms of opposite spin related by a two-fold rotation operation perpendicular to the main 4-fold rotation inversion axis. The spin splittings along a low symmetry line like $PN$ are sizable, while at k-points on the diagonal mirror planes or on the twofold symmetry axes, the spin splitting is zero. The exchange interactions are calculated using a linear response approach. The antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction between nearest neighbors in the primitive unit cell is dominating and found to be slightly decreasing upon carrier doping. The transverse spin susceptibilities, which provide interatomic site exchange interactions after averaging over the muffin-tin spheres, are calculated from the $GW$ band structure and wave functions. From these exchange interactions, the spin wave spectra are obtained along the high symmetry lines and the N\'{e}el temperature is calculated using the mean-field and Tyablikov (RPA) estimations. The dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are calculated, including excitonic effects, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The exchange interactions around Mn$_{\rm Ge}$ defect sites are also studied. While we find it can generate ferromagnetic interactions with neighboring spins, we did not find evidence of producing an overall ferromagnetic phase. If Mn antisites are introduced by exchanging Mn with a nearby Ge, the interactions stay largely antiferromagnetic. Adding Mn antisites leads to a metallic band structure.</description>

      <title>A Wigner Matrix Based Convolution Algorithm For Matrix Elements in the LCAO Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method uses a small basis set in exchange for expensive matrix element calculations. The most efficient approximation for the matrix element calculations is the two-center approximation (2CA) in tight binding (TB). In the 2CA, a variety of matrix elements are neglected with only "two-center integrals" (2CI) remaining. The 2CI are calculated efficiently by rotating to symmetrical coordinates where the integral is parameterized. This makes TB fast in exchange for diminished transferability. An ideal electronic structure method has both the efficiency of TB and the transferability of ab-initio methods. In this work, I expand the full crystal potential into multipoles where the resulting matrix elements are transformed into the form of 2CI between high angular momentum functions. The usual Slater-Koster formulae for TB are limited to $l\leq3$; to enable efficient evaluation of the full crystal potential 2CI, I derive a Wigner matrix based convolution algorithm (WMCA) that works for arbitrary angular momentum. Given a suitable method for generating a local ab-initio Kohn-Sham potential, the algorithm for calculating matrix elements is applicable to fully ab-initio LCAO methods (this is the subject of forthcoming work). In this paper, I apply the WMCA to silicon using a model crystal potential.</description>

      <title>Self-attention enabled quantum path analysis of high-harmonic generation in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Iron Oxyhalides: Real Chern topology and Valley-Spin-Lattice coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of Crystallization versus Vitrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between crystallization and vitrification in glass-forming materials manifests as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams, which quantify the time scales for crystallization as a function of temperature. We develop a coarse-grained lattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this competition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures, crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact crystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an analytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model. Both the model and theory can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy systems including bulk metallic glass alloys, organic molecules, and colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Review on spin-wave RF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores the development of spin-wave technology, highlighting magnonics as a promising route for radio frequency (RF) communication systems. The rollout of 5G and the upcoming 6G networks intensifies the demand for devices that can operate at higher frequencies while remaining scalable, compact, and energy-efficient - requirements that spin waves are well suited to meet. The first two sections revisit the fundamentals of magnonics, trace major milestones in spin-wave research, and summarize recent advances in materials and device design. The third section reviews RF applications studied over the past 50 years, with emphasis on key passive components, such as filters, limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, and directional couplers. The final section discusses both the advantages and the open challenges of spin-wave devices, including insertion losses, linearity, and power handling, together with the strategies to address them. By linking fundamental insights with technological needs, this review outlines a path toward practical RF platforms. Spin-wave-based devices, with their scalability, versatility, and potential for low-power operation, hold strong promise for future wireless communication, particularly in the 5G and 6G era.</description>

      <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear anomalous Hall transport in two-dimensional CrPS$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.</description>

      <title>Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In: A First-Principles Insight into Indium-Based Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and nontrivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature \( T_c \approx 14\ \mathrm{K} \) at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, \( T_c \) increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>
