      <title>Channel Coding for Gaussian Channels with Multifaceted Power Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by refined asymptotic results based on the normal approximation, we study how higher-order coding performance depends on the mean power $\Gamma$ as well as on finer statistics of the input power. We introduce a multifaceted power model in which the expectation of an arbitrary number of arbitrary functions of the normalized average power is constrained. The framework generalizes existing models, recovering the standard maximal and expected power constraints and the recent mean and variance constraint as special cases. Under certain growth and continuity assumptions on the functions, our main theorem gives an exact characterization of the minimum average error probability for Gaussian channels as a function of the first- and second-order coding rates. The converse proof reduces the code design problem to minimization over a compact (under the Prokhorov metric) set of probability distributions, characterizes the extreme points of this set and invokes the Bauer's maximization principle.</description>

      <title>Beyond the "G" Frontier: A Time Traveler's Century-Long Vision for Wireless Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article travels one century into the future--from 2025 to 2125--through the analytical lens of the Information--Curvature Efficiency Law (ICEL). It contends that wireless evolution will not proceed through incremental generations such as 6G or 7G, but through a curvature-managed integration of electromagnetics, biology, thermodynamics, and cognition. The resulting infrastructure will constitute a global ecology of self-aware information flow, where geometry and communication converge to sustain both technological and biological life.</description>

      <title>Hyper-VIB: A Hypernetwork-Enhanced Information Bottleneck Approach for Task-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Hyper-VIB, a hypernetwork-enhanced information bottleneck (IB) approach designed to enable efficient task-oriented communications in 6G collaborative intelligent systems. Leveraging IB theory, our approach enables an optimal end-to-end joint training of device and network models, in terms of the maximal task execution accuracy as well as the minimal communication overhead, through optimizing the trade-off hyperparameter. To address computational intractability in high-dimensional IB optimization, a tractable variational upper-bound approximation is derived. Unlike conventional grid or random search methods that require multiple training rounds with substantial computational costs, Hyper-VIB introduces a hypernetwork that generates approximately optimal DNN parameters for different values of the hyperparameter within a single training phase. Theoretical analysis in the linear case validates the hypernetwork design. Experimental results demonstrate our Hyper-VIB's superior accuracy and training efficiency over conventional VIB approaches in both classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounds in the Shuffle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shuffle model enhances privacy by anonymizing users' reports through random permutation. This paper presents the first systematic study of the single-message shuffle model from an information-theoretic perspective. We analyze two regimes: the shuffle-only setting, where each user directly submits its message ($Y_i=X_i$), and the shuffle-DP setting, where each user first applies a local $\varepsilon_0$-differentially private mechanism before shuffling ($Y_i=\mathcal{R}(X_i)$). Let $\boldsymbol{Z} = (Y_{\sigma(i)})_i$ denote the shuffled sequence produced by a uniformly random permutation $\sigma$, and let $K = \sigma^{-1}(1)$ represent the position of user 1's message after shuffling.
  For the shuffle-only setting, we focus on a tractable yet expressive \emph{basic configuration}, where the target user's message follows $Y_1 \sim P$ and the remaining users' messages are i.i.d.\ samples from $Q$, i.e., $Y_2,\dots,Y_n \sim Q$. We derive asymptotic expressions for the mutual information quantities $I(Y_1;\boldsymbol{Z})$ and $I(K;\boldsymbol{Z})$ as $n \to \infty$, and demonstrate how this analytical framework naturally extends to settings with heterogeneous user distributions.
  For the shuffle-DP setting, we establish information-theoretic upper bounds on total information leakage. When each user applies an $\varepsilon_0$-DP mechanism, the overall leakage satisfies $I(K; \boldsymbol{Z}) \le 2\varepsilon_0$ and $I(X_1; \boldsymbol{Z}\mid (X_i)_{i=2}^n) \le (e^{\varepsilon_0}-1)/(2n) + O(n^{-3/2})$. These results bridge shuffle differential privacy and mutual-information-based privacy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Repetition Codes and Their Application to HARQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of communication channels implies that any coding scheme has a non-zero probability of failing to correct errors, making retransmission mechanisms essential. To ensure message reliability and integrity, a dual-layer redundancy framework is typically employed: error correction codes mitigate noise-induced impairments at the physical layer, while cyclic redundancy checks verify message integrity after decoding. Retransmission is initiated if verification fails. This operational model can be categorized into two types of repeated communication models: Type-I systems repeatedly transmit identical codewords, whereas Type-II systems transmit distinct coded representations of the same message. The core challenge lies in maximizing the probability of correct message decoding within a limited number of transmission rounds through verification-based feedback mechanisms.
  In this paper, we consider a scenario where the same error-correcting code is used for repeated transmissions, and we specifically propose two classes of generalized repetition codes (GRCs), corresponding to the two repeated communication models. In contrast to classical theory, we regard GRCs as error-correcting codes under multiple metrics--that is, GRCs possess multiple minimum distances. This design enables GRCs to perform multi-round error correction under different metrics, achieving stronger error-correction capabilities than classical error-correcting codes. However, the special structure of GRCs makes their construction more challenging, as it requires simultaneously optimizing multiple minimum distances. To address this, we separately investigate the bounds and constructions for Type-I and Type-II GRCs, and obtain numerous optimal Type-I and Type-II GRCs.</description>

      <title>The Rate-Distortion-Perception Trade-Off with Algorithmic Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realism constraints (or constraints on perceptual quality) have received considerable recent attention within the context of lossy compression, particularly of images. Theoretical studies of lossy compression indicate that high-rate common randomness between the compressor and the decompressor is a valuable resource for achieving realism. On the other hand, the utility of significant amounts of common randomness has not been noted in practice. We offer an explanation for this discrepancy by considering a realism constraint that requires satisfying a universal critic that inspects realizations of individual compressed reconstructions, or batches thereof. We characterize the optimal rate-distortion trade-off under such a realism constraint, and show that it is asymptotically achievable without any common randomness, unless the batch size is impractically large.</description>

      <title>Communication-Pipelined Split Federated Learning for Foundation Model Fine-Tuning in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying foundation models (FMs) on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) promises broad ``low-altitude economy'' applications. Split federated learning (SFL)-based fine-tuning leverages distributed data while keeping raw data local and reduces client-side burden by partitioning the model between client and server. However, the per-round training latency is dominated by stragglers. Training paradigms featuring parallel gradient transmission (GT) allocate dedicated portions of downlink communication resources to each client. They may leave resources idle and suffer from prolonged GT latency, especially in UAV networks, where the communication latency typically far exceeds the computation latency. To address this, we propose a sequential GT paradigm, where the server dedicates all downlink resources for the current GT. We further propose communication-pipelined SFL (CPSFL), characterized by downlink GT priority scheduling and intra-round asynchronous training. We investigate CPSFL-based LoRA fine-tuning of FMs in UAV networks and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of per-round training latency and worst-case client energy consumption by optimizing the split point selection (SPS) and the computing and communication resource allocation (CCRA) (the uplink bandwidth allocation and the server computing frequency allocation). To solve this problem, we develop an attention-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where the base station agent decides the split point and the CCRA in each round by leveraging previous round information, including UAV trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based CPSFL scheme outperforms the parallel GT benchmarks, the ablation variants, the fixed CCRA scheme, while approaching the best fixed-SPS scheme.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled UAV Communications and Sensing: Opportunities, Challenges, and Key Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in the emerging low-altitude economy. However, they face significant challenges in achieving reliable network coverage during transit operations. This paper provides an in-depth investigation into the characteristics and challenges of communication networks tailored for UAVs. First, we outline typical operational scenarios, traffic patterns, and a dual-layer heterogeneous network topology. This topology is essential for enabling three-dimensional continuous coverage and ensuring seamless network coexistence between UAVs and other network entities. Moreover, the paper delves into the channel characteristics and specific challenges faced by UAV Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) networks. It highlights the limitations of traditional Active Phased Array Antenna (APAA)-based networks, particularly regarding cost, complexity, and site deployment constraints. We then introduce Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks as a promising solution for enhancing UAV signal coverage. The key technical features of RIS are discussed, including design principles, antenna tilt configurations, new beam types, and beam tracking mechanisms. In addition, we examine the impact of highfrequency bands and their absorption peaks on signal attenuation. The paper further explores network architecture designs aimed at improving UAV signal coverage, facilitating network coexistence, and supporting RIS-enhanced UAV sensing. Field trial results evaluating the effectiveness of RIS in improving UAV coverage are presented. Finally, we outline future technological trends and highlight potential advancements to further optimize UAV communication systems. We also emphasize the importance of engineering implementation and standardization efforts in RIS-based UAV-ISAC networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery can be framed as a thermodynamic process in which an agent invests physical work to acquire information about an environment under a finite work budget. Using established results about the thermodynamics of computing, we derive finite-budget bounds on information gain over rounds of sequential Bayesian learning. We also propose a metric of information-work efficiency, and compare unpartitioned and federated learning strategies under matched work budgets. The presented results offer guidance in the form of bounds and an information efficiency metric for efforts in scientific automation at large.</description>

      <title>Position Optimization for Two-layer Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology for improving the performance of wireless communication systems by providing new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization. However, existing works on MA systems have mostly considered element-wise single-layer MA (SL-MA) arrays, where all the MAs move within the given movable region, hence inevitably incurring high control complexity and hardware cost in practice. To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new two-layer MA array (TL-MA), where the positions of MAs are jointly determined by the large-scale movement of multiple subarrays and the small-scale fine-tuning of per-subarray MAs. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the TL-MA-aided communication system by jointly optimizing the subarray-positions, per-subarray (relative) MA positions, and receive beamforming. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which alternately optimizes the positions of subarrays and per-subarray MAs, given the optimal receive beamforming. Numerical results verify that the proposed TL-MA significantly reduces the sum-displacement of MA motors (i.e., the total moving distances of all motors) of element-wise SL-MA, while achieving comparable rate performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Learn Generic Multi-Index Models Near Information-Theoretic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Routing Problems via Quantum Graph Attention Network Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a fundamental NP-hard task in intelligent transportation systems with broad applications in logistics and distribution. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy GenAI over 6G: Integrated Applications and Security Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into 6G networks promises substantial performance gains while simultaneously exposing novel security vulnerabilities rooted in multimodal data processing and autonomous reasoning. This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept. Finally, we summarize open challenges and future research directions toward building trustworthy, quantum-resilient, and adaptive GenAI-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>RLS Framework with Segmentation of the Forgetting Profile and Low Rank Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report describes a new regularization approach based on segmentation of the forgetting profile in sliding window least squares estimation. Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed. New algorithms significantly improve the approximation accuracy of low resolution daily temperature measurements obtained at the Stockholm Old Astronomical Observatory, thereby enhancing the reliability of temperature predictions.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Route to Isoperimetric Inequalities via Heat Flow and Entropy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic approach to isoperimetric inequalities based on entropy dissipation under heat flow. By viewing diffusion as a noisy information channel, we measure how mutual information about set membership decays over time. This decay rate is shown to be determined by the boundary measure of the set, leading to a new proof of the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality with its sharp constant. The method extends to Riemannian manifolds satisfying curvature-dimension conditions, yielding Levy-Gromov and Gaussian isoperimetric results within a single analytic principle. Quantitative and stability bounds follow from refined entropy inequalities linking information loss to geometric rigidity. The approach connects geometric analysis and information theory, revealing how entropy dissipation encodes the geometry of diffusion and boundary.</description>

      <title>Collision Resolution in RFID Systems Using Antenna Arrays and Mix Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an efficient mix source separation algorithm for collision resolution in radio frequency identification (RFID) systems equipped with an antenna array at the reader. We first introduce an approach that exploits the zero constant modulus (ZCM) criterion to separate colliding tags through gradient descent, without using pilot symbols. We show that the ZCM characteristic, considered alone, in the design of the objective function can lead to significant ambiguities in the determination of the beamformers used in the recovery of tag messages. To address this limitation, we propose a more sophisticated approach, relying on a hybrid objective function, incorporating a new ambiguity-raising criterion in addition to the ZCM criterion.</description>

      <title>Randomized Power Transmission with Optimized Level Selection Probabilities in Uncoordinated Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider uncoordinated random uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a set of predetermined power levels. We propose to optimize the probabilities of selection of power levels in order to minimize performance metrics as block error probability (BLEP) or bit error probability (BEP). When the multiuser detection algorithm at the BS treats at most two colliding users' packets, our optimization problem is a quadratic programming problem. For more colliding users' packets, we solve the problem iteratively. Our solution is original because it applies to any multiuser detection algorithm and any set of power levels.</description>

      <title>Cartan meets Cram\'er-Rao</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a jet bundle and Cartan geometric foundation for the curvature-aware refinements of the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) introduced in our earlier work. We show that the extrinsic corrections to variance bounds, previously derived from the second fundamental form of the square root embedding $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$ for model density $f(\cdot;\theta)$ with scalar parameter $\theta$, admit an intrinsic formulation within the Cartan prolongation framework. Starting from the canonical contact forms and total derivative on the finite jet bundle $J^m(\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R})$, we construct the Cartan distribution and the associated Ehresmann connection, whose non-integrability and torsion encode the geometric source of curvature corrections in statistical estimation. In the statistical jet bundle $E=\mathbb{R}\times L^2(\mu)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy. The resulting framework links variance bounds, curvature, and estimator efficiency through the geometry of Cartan distributions, offering a new differential equation and connection-theoretic interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.</description>

      <title>Randomized Scheduling for Periodic Multi-Source Systems with PAoI Violation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation guarantee in a periodic multi-source status update system. The system is served by a shared base station, which requires scheduling. Our main contribution is a randomized scheduling framework that targets heterogeneous PAoI requirements. To that end, we derive numerically trackable upper bounds on the PAoI violation probability in two traffic regimes (long and short period) by leveraging the multivariate noncentral hypergeometric Wallenius distribution and the geometric distribution, respectively. Guided by these bounds, we design two low-complexity randomized scheduling schemes that meet diverse PAoI violation probability targets without the traffic assumption. Simulations validate the bounds and demonstrate feasible operation across a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <title>Entropic additive energy and entropy inequalities for sums and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a growing number of studies that, over the past 15 years, have established entropy inequalities via ideas and tools from additive combinatorics, in this work we obtain a number of new bounds for the differential entropy of sums, products, and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. Partly motivated by recent work by Goh on the discrete entropic version of the notion of "additive energy", we introduce the additive energy of pairs of continuous random variables and prove various versions of the statement that "the additive energy is large if and only if the entropy of the sum is small", along with a version of the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem for differential entropy. Then, motivated in part by recent work by M\'ath\'e and O'Regan, we establish a series of new differential entropy inequalities for products and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. In particular, we prove a new, general, ring Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa entropy inequality. We briefly return to the case of discrete entropy and provide a characterization of discrete random variables with "large doubling", analogous to Tao's Freiman-type inverse sumset theory for the case of small doubling. Finally, we consider the natural entropic analog of the Erd\"os-Szemer\'edi sum-product phenomenon for integer-valued random variables. We show that, if it does hold, then the range of parameters for which it does would necessarily be significantly more restricted than its anticipated combinatorial counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as a $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</description>

      <title>The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices -- representing an unknown signal -- from their associated Gram matrices. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, for a prior of sufficiently low dimension, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch -- an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.</description>

      <title>ZENN: A Thermodynamics-Inspired Computational Framework for Heterogeneous Data-Driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in classification problems - have long been essential tools for representing the information uncertainty and physical disorder in data and for developing artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. To address this, we introduce a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN), extending zentropy theory into the data science domain via intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. ZENN simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. ZENN demonstrates superior generalization by introducing a learnable temperature variable that models latent multi-source heterogeneity, allowing it to surpass state-of-the-art models on CIFAR-10/100, BBCNews, and AGNews. As a practical application in materials science, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe$_3$Pt using data generated from density functional theory (DFT) and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature-pressure space. Overall, this work presents a zentropy-grounded framework for data-driven machine learning, positioning ZENN as a versatile and robust approach for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>
