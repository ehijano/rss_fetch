      <title>Recovering Exact Vibrational Energies Within a Phase Space Electronic Structure Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a push to go beyond Born-Oppenheimer theory and build electronic states from a phase space perspective, i.e. parameterize electronic states by both nuclear position(R) and nuclear momentum(P). Previous empirical studies have demonstrated that such approaches can yield improved single-surface observables, including vibrational energies, electronic momenta, and vibrational circular dichroism spectra. That being said, unlike the case of BO theory, there is no unique phase space electronic Hamiltonian, nor any theory for using phase space eigenvectors (as opposed to BO eigenvectors) so as to recover exact quantum vibrational eigenvalues. As such, one might consider such phase space approaches ad hoc. To that end, here we show how to formally extract exact quantum energies from a coupled nuclear-electronic Hamiltonian using perturbation theory on top of a phase space electronic framework. Thus, while we cannot isolate an "optimal" phase space electronic Hamiltonian, this work does justify a phase space electronic structure approach by offering a rigorous framework for correcting the zeroth order phase space electronic states.</description>

      <title>Compact magnetic field cycling system with the range from nT to 9.4 T exemplified with 13C relaxation dispersion and SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact magnetic field cycling system for high-resolution NMR spectrometers. The system enables the transfer of the sample from B0 field of 9.4 T to about nT and all fields in between within 1 second. Utilizing a flexible gear rod made the shuttling system more compact, reducing the height to about the height required for filling liquid helium - hence, it can be installed in average-size NMR laboratories (the height of NMR with MFC is only 3.32 m). The system utility is exemplified by measuring T1 relaxation dispersion of the most common liquid state hyperpolarization tracer - [1-13C]pyruvate - and magnetic field dependences of signal amplification by reversible exchange enabling alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH) hyperpolarization of [15N]pyridine. Using the system, we uncovered the exact relaxation of the pyruvate for a common preclinical dDNP sample composition and gave quantitative estimates for the retained polarization after sample transfer. We modified the observation protocol of SABRE-SHEATH polarization, which, with the high reproducibility of the MFC, provided us with a method to measure the chemical exchange rates of hyperpolarized compounds.</description>

      <title>Density dependent embedding potentials for piecewise exact densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frozen Density Embedding Theory (FDET) [Wesolowski {\it Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 77}, 012504 (2008)] provides the interpretation of the eigenvalue equations for an embedded $N'$-electron wavefunction, in which the embedding operator is multiplicative, as the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the constrained minimisation of the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional. The constraint is given by a non-negative function integrating to an integer $N-N'&gt;0$ with $N$ being the total number of electrons in the whole system ($\min_{\rho\rightarrow\forall_{\mathbf{r}}\big(\rho({\mathbf r})\ge \rho_2({\mathbf r}\big)} E^{HK}_v[\rho]=E^{HK}_v[\rho_1^{FDET}+\rho_2]\ge E^{HK}[\rho_v^{o}]=E^o_v$). The exact FDET eigenvalue equations are analysed for $\rho_2$ such that it is equal to the exact ground-state density $\rho_v^{o}({\mathbf r})$ in some measurable volume. It is shown that, the stationary ($\rho_1^{FDET}$) obtained from the FDET eigenvalue equations - if it exists - differs from $\rho_1^o=\rho_v^{o}-\rho_2$ leading to the sharp inequality $E^{HK}[\rho_1^{FDET}+\rho_2]&gt; E^o_v$ for such densities $\rho_2$.
  The result is discussed in the context of subsystem DFT, pseudopotential theory, and exact density-dependent embedding potentials.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Core-Valence-Separated Molecular Mean-Field Exact-Two-Component Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Theory: Applications to L-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L-edge X-ray absorption spectra for first-row transition metal complexes are obtained from relativistic equation-of-motion singles and doubles coupled-cluster (EOM-CCSD) calculations that make use of the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme, with scalar and spin--orbit relativistic effects modeled within the molecular mean-field exact two-component (X2C) framework. By incorporating relativistic effects variationally at the Dirac--Coulomb--Breit (DCB) reference level, this method delivers accurate predictions of L-edge features, including energy shifts, intensity ratios, and fine-structure splittings, across a range of molecular systems. Benchmarking against perturbative spin--orbit treatments and relativistic TDDFT highlights the superior performance and robustness of the CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD approach, including the reliability of basis set recontraction schemes. While limitations remain in describing high-density spectral regions, our results establish CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD as a powerful and broadly applicable tool for relativistic core-excitation spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Developing a Neural Network Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of La-Si-P Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While molecular dynamics (MD) is a very useful computational method for atomistic simulations, modeling the interatomic interactions for reliable MD simulations of real materials has been a long-standing challenge. In 2007, Behler and Perrinello first proposed and demonstrated an artificial neural network machine learning (ANN-ML) scheme, opening a new paradigm for developing accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulation studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of materials. In this paper, we show that an accurate and transferable ANN-ML interatomic potential can be developed for MD simulations of La-Si-P system. The crucial role of training data in the ML potential development is discussed. The developed ANN-ML potential accurately describes not only the energy versus volume curves for all the known elemental, binary, and ternary crystalline structures in La-Si-P system, but also the structures of La-Si-P liquids with various compositions. Using the developed ANN-ML potential, the melting temperatures of several crystalline phases in La-Si-P system are predicted by the coexistence of solid-liquid phases from MD simulations. While the ANN-ML model systematically underestimates the melting temperatures of these phases, the overall trend agrees with experiment. The developed ANN-ML potential is also applied to study the nucleation and growth of LaP as a function of different relative concentrations of Si and P in the La-Si-P liquid, and the obtained results are consistent with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sulfur speciation in magmatic-hydrothermal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative knowledge of sulfur speciation in the fluid phase is key to understanding sulfur degassing from magmas and its transfer along with metals by fluids across the lithosphere. Farsang and Zajacz (1) recently reported new sulfur speciation data using Raman spectroscopy measurements on aqueous H$_2$SO$_4$-NaCl(-KCl) solutions trapped as synthetic fluid inclusions in quartz at 875$^\circ$C and 2 kbar under variable redox conditions. They interpreted the data by dominant SO$_{2(aq)}$ and HS$^-$, along with subordinate H$_2$S$_{(aq)}$, whereas the di-and trisulfur radical ions, $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ and $[S_2^\bullet]^-$, reported in aqueous fluids both in nature and experiment to at least 700 $^\circ$C and 15 kbar (2-5) , were undetectable in Raman nonresonant spectra 1 . On the basis of thermochemical calculations that returned negligible HS$^-$ and large $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ concentrations at their experimental conditions, the authors claimed that the published $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ and HS$^-$ thermodynamic data were incorrect and that the major species controlling both sulfur and gold transport in hydrothermal-magmatic fluids is the HS$^-$ anion. Here I demonstrate that their conclusions stem from the use of inconsistent thermodynamic data and incorrect Raman spectra assignments. Thus, ref. 1 provides no grounds for questioning the validity of the thermodynamic properties of HS$^-$ and $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ or of their metal complexes in the fluids of the Earth's crust.</description>

      <title>Full ab initio atomistic approach for morphology prediction of hetero-integrated crystals: A confrontation with experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material. This method uses both reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, as determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands over the whole range of accessible chemical potentials. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si, are found to be in good agreements with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Such method provides a tool for optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional and smart materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Quantum Chemistry for Accurate Negative Singlet-Triplet Gap Predictions: A Case for Double-Hybrid DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules that have been suggested to violate the Hund's rule, having a first excited singlet state (S$_1$) energetically below the triplet state (T$_1$), are rare. Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ($&gt;100$ meV) despite very low standard deviations ($\approx10$ meV). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ligand strain energy, the energy difference between the bound and unbound conformations of a ligand, is an important component of structure-based small molecule drug design. A large majority of observed ligands in protein-small molecule co-crystal structures bind in low-strain conformations, making strain energy a useful filter for structure-based drug design. In this work we present a tool for calculating ligand strain with a high accuracy. StrainRelief uses a MACE Neural Network Potential (NNP), trained on a large database of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to estimate ligand strain of neutral molecules with quantum accuracy. We show that this tool estimates strain energy differences relative to DFT to within 1.4 kcal/mol, more accurately than alternative NNPs. These results highlight the utility of NNPs in drug discovery, and provide a useful tool for drug discovery teams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multireference systems are usually challenging to investigate using ab initio methods as they require an accurate description of static electron correlation. The urgency of developing similar approaches is even more pressing when molecules strongly interact with light in quantum-electrodynamics (QED) environments. In fact, in this context, multireference effects might be induced or reduced by the presence of the field. In this work, we extend the Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) approach to polaritonic systems. The method is tested on benchmark multireference problems and applied to investigate field-induced effects on the electronic structure of well-known multiconfigurational processes. Strengths and limitations of the method have been thoroughly analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We predict an anomalous thermally activated superradiance in molecular aggregates within polaritonic environments. In contrast to free space, the collective emission is enhanced when either the exciton-phonon coupling or the temperature increases. This counterintuitive phenomenon is captured by a microscopic theory that combines macroscopic quantum electrodynamics with a modified polaron quantum master equation approach, revealing a nontrivial interplay among excitons, phonons, and polaritons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that neural networks can be optimized to represent minimum energy paths as continuous functions, offering a flexible alternative to discrete path-search methods like Nudged Elastic Band (NEB). Our approach parameterizes reaction paths with a network trained on a loss function that discards tangential energy gradients and enables instant estimation of the transition state. We first validate the method on two-dimensional potentials and then demonstrate its advantages over NEB on challenging atomistic systems where (i) poor initial guesses yield unphysical paths, (ii) multiple competing paths exist, or (iii) the reaction follows a complex multi-step mechanism. Results highlight the versatility of the method: for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions. Finally, in a low-dimensional setting, we demonstrate that a single neural network can learn from existing paths and generalize to unseen systems, showing promise for a universal reaction path representation.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Variational Quantum Eigensolver Applied to Chemistry</title>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics has introduced a new theoretical framework for the study of molecules, enabling the prediction of properties and dynamics through the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation applied to these systems. However, solving this equation is computationally expensive, which has led to the development of various mathematical frameworks and computational methods designed to balance the available resources with the desired level of accuracy. In particular, quantum computers have emerged as a promising technology with the potential to address these problems more efficiently in the coming decades, whether through reductions in memory, time, and energy consumption, $\textit{i. e.}$, reductions in computational complexity or by enhancing precision. This research field is known as Quantum Simulation. Given the current technological limitations of quantum computers, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), stand out as a feasible approach to demonstrating advantages over classical methods in the near term. This feasibility arises from their lower demand for quantum gates and the reduced depth of the circuits required for their implementation. In this work, we present the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules, provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, and explore the integration of these fields by employing the VQE in molecular simulations. Finally, we discuss the spatial and temporal complexity associated with the algorithm, highlighting its implications and challenges.</description>
