      <title>Heracles: A HfO$\mathrm{_2}$ Ferroelectric Capacitor Compact Model for Efficient Circuit Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-based compact model for circuit simulations in a SPICE environment for HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps). The model has been calibrated based on experimental data obtained from HfO2-based FeCaps. A thermal model with an accurate description of the device parasitics is included to derive precise device characteristics based on first principles. The model incorporates statistical data that enables Monte Carlo analysis based on realistic distributions, thereby making it particularly well-suited for design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). Furthermore, the model is demonstrated in circuit simulations using an integrated circuit with current programming, wherein partial switching of the ferroelectric polarization is observed. Finally, the model was benchmarked in an array simulation, reaching convergence in 1.8 s with an array size of 100 kb.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>MIMO MAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Capacity Region and Large System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart wireless environments enabled by multiple distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have recently attracted significant research interest as a wireless connectivity paradigm for sixth Generation (6G) networks. In this paper, using random matrix theory methods, we calculate the mean of the sum Mutual Information (MI) for the correlated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Multiple Access Channel (MAC) in the presence of multiple RISs, in the large-antenna number limit. We thus obtain the capacity region boundaries, after optimizing over the tunable RISs' phase configurations. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form expression for the variance of the sum-MI metric, which together with the mean provides a tight Gaussian approximation for the outage probability. The derived results become relevant in the presence of fast-fading, when channel estimation is extremely challenging. Our numerical investigations showcased that, when the angle-spread in the neighborhood of each RIS is small, which is expected for higher carrier frequencies, the communication link strongly improves from optimizing the ergodic MI of the multiple RISs.We also found that, increasing the number of transmitting users in such MIMO-MAC-RIS systems results to rapidly diminishing sum-MI gains, hence, providing limits on the number of users that can be efficiently served by a given RIS.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Quantization in Brain-Computer Interfaces based on Event-Related Potential Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a technique used to optimize and reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of machine learning models. It has been used primarily for neural networks. For Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that are fully portable and usable in various situations, it is necessary to provide approaches that are lightweight for storage and computation. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of post-training quantization on state-of-the-art approaches in brain-computer interfaces and assess their impact on accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve drops from 0.861 to 0.825 with PTQ when applied on both spatial filters and the classifier, while reducing the size of the model by about $\times$ 15. The results support the conclusion that PTQ can substantially reduce the memory footprint of the models while keeping roughly the same level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>ReCon: Reconfiguring Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has shown theoretical promise of speedup in several machine learning tasks, including generative tasks using generative adversarial networks (GANs). While quantum computers have been implemented with different types of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have been demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit (quantum bit) positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties of this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and real-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art technique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.</description>

      <title>To Be or Not to Be (in the EU): Measurement of Discrepancies Presented in Cookie Paywalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cookie paywalls allow visitors to access the content of a website only after making a choice between paying a fee (paying option) or accepting tracking (cookie option). The practice has been studied in previous research in regard to its prevalence and legal standing, but the effects of the clients' device and geographic location remain unexplored. To address these questions, this study explores the effects of three factors: 1) the clients' browser, 2) the device type (desktop or mobile), and 3) the geographic location on the presence and behavior of cookie paywalls and the handling of users' data.
  Using an automatic crawler on our dataset composed of 804 websites that present a cookie paywall, we observed that the presence of a cookie paywall was most affected by the geographic location of the user. We further showed that both the behavior of a cookie paywall and the processing of user data are impacted by all three factors, but no patterns of significance could be found. Finally, an additional type of paywall was discovered to be used on approximately 11% of the studied websites, coined the "double paywall", which consists of a cookie paywall complemented by another paywall once tracking is accepted.</description>
