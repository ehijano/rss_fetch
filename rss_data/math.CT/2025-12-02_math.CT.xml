      <title>High schoolers excel at Oxford quantum course using pictorial mathematics</title>

Abstract: We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding.
  This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology.
  We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade.
  These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inference for Bayesian Networks and Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.
  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-derivators for formal $\infty$-category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derivators, introduced independently by Grothendieck and Heller in the 1980s, provide a categorical framework for studying homotopy theory. They are based on the idea that, while the homotopy 1-category of a single model category or $(\infty, 1)$-category retains only limited information, the structured collection of homotopy 1-categories of diagram categories often suffices for many homotopical purposes. In this paper, we introduce a set of axioms for a 2-dimensional analog of derivators: a refinement of the homotopy 2-category of an enriched model category or $(\infty, 2)$-category into a coherent system of homotopy 2-categories of higher categories of diagrams. We show that these axioms are satisfied in a variety of models, including standard ones related to $(\infty, 1)$-category theory. Moreover, we prove that the axioms are preserved under a certain shift operation.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory provides a unified language for organizing composable operations in many disciplines. In disciplines where unitarity is fundamental -- such as functional analysis, quantum field theory, and quantum logic -- this language must also capture adjoints, leading to the notion of dagger categories. Higher category theory, which extends this framework to encode operations between operations, has recently become indispensable in both theoretical physics and pure mathematics. Finding a higher categorical analogue of a dagger category is therefore key to the foundations of quantum field theory.
  In this work, we present a coherent definition of \emph{dagger $(\infty,n)$-category} in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define (fully-local) \emph{reflection-positive topological quantum field theories} to be higher dagger functors out of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$.</description>

      <title>The internal languages of univalent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, $\sum$-types, and $\prod$-types. This theorem expresses that the internal language of locally Cartesian closed categories is extensional Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums and products. In this paper, we study the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend it to various classes of toposes, among which are $\prod$-pretoposes, elementary toposes, and elementary toposes with a universe. The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Rocq and the UniMath library.</description>

Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane trace isomorphism between the third 2-abelian cohomology group and quadratic forms. Our approach yields explicit constructions and we characterize when quadratic forms can be expressed as traces of bilinear forms for arbitrary coefficient groups.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Transformations of Physical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that the existence of sequential and parallel composition supermaps in higher order theories of transformations can be formalised using enriched category theory. Encouraged by relevant examples such as unitary supermaps and layers within higher order causal categories (HOCCs), we treat the modelling of higher order physical theories with enriched monoidal categories in analogy with the modelling of physical theories with monoidal categories. We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.</description>

      <title>On the structure of \'etale fibrations of $L_\infty$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an \'etale fibration between $L_\infty$-bundles admits local sections composed of several elementary morphisms of particularly simple and accessible type. As applications, we establish an inverse function theorem for $L_\infty$-bundles and provide an elementary proof that every weak equivalence of $L_\infty$-bundles induces a quasi-isomorphism of the differential graded algebras of global functions. Furthermore, we apply this inverse function theorem to show that the homotopy category of $L_\infty$-bundles admits a simple description in terms of homotopy classes of morphisms, when $L_\infty$-bundles are restricted to their germs around their classical loci.</description>
