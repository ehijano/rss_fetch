      <title>Foundation Models for Discovery and Exploration in Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400 structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction, stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery, design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Using Artificial Intelligence to Understand Intrinsic Kinetics of Heterogeneous Catalytic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing heterogeneous catalysis research by accelerating simulations and materials discovery. A key frontier is integrating AI with multiscale models and multimodal experiments to address the "many-to-one" challenge of linking intrinsic kinetics to observables. Advances in machine-learned force fields, microkinetics, and reactor modeling enable rapid exploration of chemical spaces, while operando and transient data provide unprecedented insight. Yet, inconsistent data quality and model complexity limit mechanistic discovery. Generative and agentic AI can automate model generation, quantify uncertainty, and couple theory with experiment, realizing "self-driving models" that produce interpretable, reproducible, and transferable understanding of catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Spectroscopic Properties of Solvated Nile Red with Automated Workflows for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) offer a powerful combination of abilities for accelerating theoretical spectroscopy calculations utilising both ensemble sampling and trajectory post-processing for inclusion of vibronic effects, which can be very challenging for traditional ab initio MD approaches. We demonstrate a workflow that enables efficient generation of MLIPs for the solvatochromic dye nile red system, in a variety of solvents. We use iterative active learning techniques to make this process as efficient as possible in terms of number and size of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we compare the efficacy of various methodologies: generating distinct MLIPs for each adiabatic state, using one ground state MLIP in combination with delta-ML of excitation energies, and using a three-headed multiheaded ML model. To evaluate the validity of the resulting models, we compare predicted absorption and emission spectra to experimental spectra. We found that the incorporation of larger solvent systems into training data, and the use of delta models to predict the excitation energies, enables the accurate and affordable prediction of UV-Vis spectra with accuracy equivalent to the ground truth method, which is time-dependent DFT in this case.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Decoherence Time Formulas for Surface Hopping Simulation of High-Dimensional Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 7680), we utilized the exact quantum dynamics results as references and proposed a general machine learning method to obtain the optimal decoherence time formula for surface hopping simulation. Here, we extend this strategy from one-dimensional systems to the much more intricate scenarios with multiple nuclear dimensions. Different from the one-dimensional situation, an effective nuclear kinetic energy is defined by extracting the component of nuclear momenta along the non-adiabatic coupling vector. Combined with the energy difference between adiabatic states, high-order descriptor space can be generated by binary operations. Then the optimal decoherence time formula can be obtained by machine learning procedures based on the full quantum dynamics reference data. Although we only use the final channel populations in 24 scattering samples as training data for machine learning, the obtained optimal decoherence time formula can well reproduce the time evolution of the reduced and spatial distribution of population. As benchmarked in a large number of 56840 one- and two-dimensional samples, the optimal decoherence time formula shows exceptionally high and uniform performance when compared with all other available formulas.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Catalytic Descriptor of Single-Atom Catalysts in Nitrate Reduction Reaction: An Interpretable Machine-Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the catalytic descriptor that accurately characterizes the structure-activity relationships of typical catalysts for various important heterogeneous catalytic reactions is pivotal for designing high-efficient catalytic systems. Here, an interpretable machine learning technique was employed to identify the key determinants governing the nitrate reduction reaction ($\rm NO_3RR$) performance across 286 single-atom catalysts (SACs) with the active sites anchored on double-vacancy $\rm BC_3$ monolayers. Through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis with reliable predictive accuracy, we quantitatively demonstrated that, favorable $\rm NO_3RR$ activity stems from a delicate balance among three critical factors: low $\rm N_V$, moderate $\rm D_N$, and specific doping patterns. Building upon these insights, we established a descriptor ($\psi$) that integrates the intrinsic catalytic properties and the intermediate O-N-H angle ($\theta$), effectively capturing the underlying structure-activity relationship. Guided by this, we further identified 16 promising catalysts with predicted low limiting potential ($U_{\rm L}$). Importantly, these catalysts are composed of cost-effective non-precious metal elements and are predicted to surpass most reported catalysts, with the best-performing Ti-V-1N1 is predicted to have an ultra-low $U_{\rm L}$ of $-0.10$ V.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Unveiling chiral electron-photon correlation effects in circularly polarized optical devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling with circularly polarized vacuum fluctuations offers a viable route to manipulate molecular chirality. While experiments are advancing toward the realization of chiral cavities, a mean-field theoretical framework for describing electron-photon interaction in this platform has been missing. Here, we present a mean-field theory that can be systematically improved to capture the chiral correlation effects responsible for the enantioselective power of chiral light. We use strong coupling M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory for accessing the excitation manifold of electrons and chiral virtual photons. We apply the developed methods to selected chiral systems and show that the mean-field theory captures cavity frequency dispersion, but fails to describe the chiral discrimination arising from coupled electron-photon excitations.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Static and Dynamic Polarizability of BaOH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the static and dynamic polarizability of the barium monohydroxide ($^{138}$BaOH) molecule, using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. By thoroughly investigating the dependence of the calculated polarizabilities on computational parameters (basis set size, treatment of relativity, level of treatment of electron correlation, and vibrational corrections), a procedure to determine uncertainties is constructed and applied. The dipole moment of BaOH is also calculated and compared to experiment, confirming the accuracy of the predicted polarizabilities. The static and dynamic ($\lambda=1064\;\text{nm}$) polarizability was calculated for both the ground state and the (010) vibrational bending mode, the latter state being particularly interesting for a wide range of quantum experiments. The ground state static polarizabilities were calculated to be 200.8(24) a.u. and 297(5) a.u. for the parallel and perpendicular components respectively.</description>

      <title>Manning-type potential induced by kink scatterings with phonons in molecular chains with hyperbolic double-well substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rescaled Manning potential is obtained in the analysis of scatterings of small- amplitude excitations with a kink defect. The generic model is a nonlinear Klein- Gordon Hamiltonian describing a one-dimensional chain of identical molecules, sub- jected to an hyperbolic single-particle substrate potential. To account for isotope effects that are likely to affect characteristic equilibrium parameters of the molec- ular chain, including the lattice spacing (i.e. the characteristic intermolecuar dis- tance) and/or the barrier height, the hyperbolic substrate potential is endowed with a real parameter whose variation makes it suitable for the description of molecu- lar excitations in a broad range of systems with inversion symmetry. These include hydrogen-bonded molecular crystals, {\alpha}-helix proteins, long polymer chains and two- state quantum-tunneling systems in general. Double-well models with deformable profiles are relevant in physical contexts where the equilibrium configurations are sensitive to atomic or molecular substitutions, dilution, solvation and so on.</description>

      <title>How Accurate Are DFT Forces? Unexpectedly Large Uncertainties in Molecular Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training of general-purpose machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) relies on large datasets with properties usually computed with density functional theory (DFT). A pre-requisite for accurate MLIPs is that the DFT data are well converged to minimize numerical errors. A possible symptom of errors in DFT force components is nonzero net force. Here, we consider net forces in datasets including SPICE, Transition1x, ANI-1x, ANI-1xbb, AIMNet2, QCML, and OMol25. Several of these datasets suffer from significant nonzero DFT net forces. We also quantify individual force component errors by comparison to recomputed forces using more reliable DFT settings at the same level of theory, and we find significant discrepancies in force components averaging from 1.7 meV/{\AA} in the SPICE dataset to 33.2 meV/{\AA} in the ANI-1x dataset. These findings underscore the importance of well converged DFT data as increasingly accurate MLIP architectures become available.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical simulation study on the thermal performance of building envelope structures incorporating the solid-solid phase change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is an experimental and numerical study of the thermal performance of building envelope structures incorporating a solid-solid phase change material (S-S PCM), consisting in a cross-linked polyurethane designated as PUX-1500-20. This S-S PCM is capable of storing and releasing thermal energy via phase transitions within the human comfort temperature range, facilitating the temporal and spatial transfer of solar energy for optimizing energy efficiency. The primary aim of this work is to integrate the S-S PCM into hollow bricks used in building envelopes and to evaluate their thermal inertia through both experimental testing and numerical simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the integration of the PCM effectively delays and decreases the indoor temperature peak. The simulation results also show that the incorporation of the S-S PCM into hollow bricks gives rise to a phase shift of 7 hours and a decrement factor of 0.38. In comparison with the thermal behavior of the building envelopes (hollow brick) without PCMs, our results provide convincing evidence of the important thermal inertia of these structures incorporating the PCMs, revealing their significant potential in reducing energy consumption of building.</description>

      <title>Simulating high-accuracy nuclear motion Hamiltonians in discrete variable representation using Walsh-Hadamard QROM with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method integrates exact curvilinear kinetic energy operators and general-form potential energy surfaces expressed in a hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. The Hamiltonian is encoded as a unitary quantum circuit using a quantum read-only memory construction based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform, enabling high-accuracy quantum phase estimation of rovibrational energy levels. Our technique provides asymptotic reductions in both logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity that are exponential in the number of atoms and at least polynomial in the total Hilbert-space size, relative to existing block-encoding techniques based on linear combinations of unitaries. Compared with classical variational methods, it offers exponential memory savings and polynomial reductions in time complexity. The quantum volume required for computing the rovibrational spectrum of water can be reduced by up to $10^{5}$ times compared with other quantum methods, increasing to at least $10^{6}$ for a 30-dimensional (12-atom) model system. For this case with a six-body coupled potential, estimating spectroscopic-accuracy energy levels would require about three months on a $1~\mathrm{MHz}$ fault-tolerant quantum processor with fewer than 300 logical qubits, versus over 30,000 years on the fastest current classical supercomputer. These estimates are approximate and subject to technological uncertainties, and realizing the asymptotic advantage will require substantial quantum resources and continued algorithmic progress.</description>

      <title>Observation of counterion binding in the inner Helmholtz layer at the ionic surfactant-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding specific ion adsorption within the inner Helmholtz layer remains central to electrochemistry yet experimentally elusive. Here we directly quantify counterion adsorption and extract the associated thermodynamic parameters within the inner Helmholtz layer using phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS). Using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a model ionic surfactant, we determine the Na+ and DS- surface densities by simultaneously analyzing interfacial free OH response and the diffuse-layer SF signal, from which the adsorption thermodynamic parameters are derived. We then construct an adsorption phase diagram that maps the evolution of Na+ and DS- species in the compact layer as functions of bulk NaCl and SDS concentrations, revealing a continuous increase in surface ion pairing. The DS-: Na+ pairing ratio gradually decreases with increasing NaCl and approaches 2.8 at the supersaturation state prior to surface nucleation. These results establish PS-SFVS as a quantitative probe of ion-headgroup correlations in charged interfaces and reveal the thermodynamic mechanism underlying counterion-mediated interfacial ordering, with broad implications for electrolyte design, biomembrane stability, and soft-matter assembly.</description>

      <title>Collisional Excitation in Space: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Carbon Capture using AI: Design of permeable membrane and estimation of parameters for Carbon Capture using linear regression and membrane-based equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13373</link>

Abstract: This study focuses on membrane-based systems for CO$_2$ separation, addressing the urgent need for efficient carbon capture solutions to mitigate climate change. Linear regression models, based on membrane equations, were utilized to estimate key parameters, including porosity ($\epsilon$) of 0.4805, Kozeny constant (K) of 2.9084, specific surface area ($\sigma$) of 105.3272 m$^2$/m$^3$, mean pressure (Pm) of 6.2166 MPa, viscosity ($\mu$) of 0.1997 Ns/m$^2$, and gas flux (Jg) of 3.2559 kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. These parameters were derived from the analysis of synthetic datasets using linear regression. The study also provides insights into the performance of the membrane, with a flow rate (Q) of 9.8778 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ m$^3$/s, an injection pressure (P$_1$) of 2.8219 MPa, and an exit pressure (P$_2$) of 2.5762 MPa. The permeability value of 0.045 for CO$_2$ indicates the potential for efficient separation. Optimizing membrane properties to selectively block CO$_2$ while allowing other gases to pass is crucial for improving carbon capture efficiency. By integrating these technologies into industrial processes, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved, fostering a circular carbon economy and contributing to global climate goals. This study also explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can aid in designing membranes for carbon capture, addressing the global climate change challenge and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations.</description>

      <title>LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO performs competitively on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising 23 objective functions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on its low-budget version PMO-1K.</description>

      <title>Committors without Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>
