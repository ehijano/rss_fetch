      <title>Beyond the Mean: Testing Consumer Rationality through Higher Moments of Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a setting where an analyst has access to purely aggregate information about the consumption choices of a heterogenous population of individuals. We show that observing the statistical moments of market demand allows the analyst to test aggregate data for rationality. Interestingly, just the mean and variance of demand carry observable restrictions. This is in stark contrast to impossibility result of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem, which shows that aggregate demand carries no observable restrictions at all. We leverage our approach to deliver a characterization of rationality in terms of moments for the common two-good case. We illustrate the usefulness of moment-based restrictions through two applications: (i) improving the precision of demand and welfare estimates; and (ii) testing for the existence of a welfare-relevant representative consumer.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Sybil Attack Resistant Voting Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voting mechanisms are widely accepted and used methods for decentralized decision-making. Ensuring the acceptance of the voting mechanism's outcome is a crucial characteristic of robust voting systems. Consider this scenario: A group of individuals wants to choose an option from a set of alternatives without requiring an identification or proof-of-personhood system. Moreover, they want to implement utilitarianism as their selection criteria. In such a case, players could submit votes multiple times using dummy accounts, commonly known as a Sybil attack (SA), which presents a challenge for decentralized organizations. Is there a voting mechanism that always prevents players from benefiting by casting votes multiple times (SA-proof) while also selecting the alternative that maximizes the added valuations of all players (efficient)? One-person-one-vote is neither SA-proof nor efficient. Coin voting is SA-proof but not efficient. Quadratic voting is efficient but not SA-proof. This study uses Bayesian mechanism design to propose a solution. The mechanism's structure is as follows: Players make wealth deposits to indicate the strength of their preference for each alternative. Each player then receives an amount based on their deposit and the voting outcome. The proposed mechanism relies on two main concepts: 1) Transfers are influenced by the outcome in a way that each player's optimal action depends only on individual preferences and the number of alternatives; 2) A player who votes through multiple accounts slightly reduces the expected utility of all players more than the individual benefit gained. This study demonstrates that if players are risk-neutral and each player has private information about their preferences and beliefs, then the mechanism is SA-proof and efficient. This research provides new insights into the design of more robust decentralized decision-making mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Patience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by formulating and characterizing a dominance criterion for prize sequences: $x$ dominates $y$ if any impatient agent prefers $x$ to $y$. With this in hand, we define a notion of comparative patience. Alice is more patient than Bob if Alice's normalized discounted utility gain by going from any $y$ to any dominating $x$ is less than Bob's discounted utility gain from such an improvement. We provide a full characterization of this relation in terms of the agents' discount rules.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate auction mechanisms for AI-generated content, focusing on applications like ad creative generation. In our model, agents' preferences over stochastically generated content are encoded as large language models (LLMs). We propose an auction format that operates on a token-by-token basis, and allows LLM agents to influence content creation through single dimensional bids. We formulate two desirable incentive properties and prove their equivalence to a monotonicity condition on output aggregation. This equivalence enables a second-price rule design, even absent explicit agent valuation functions. Our design is supported by demonstrations on a publicly available LLM.</description>

      <title>Contractual Reinforcement Learning: Pulling Arms with Invisible Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The agency problem emerges in today's large scale machine learning tasks, where the learners are unable to direct content creation or enforce data collection. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for aligning economic interests of different stakeholders in the online learning problems through contract design. The problem, termed \emph{contractual reinforcement learning}, naturally arises from the classic model of Markov decision processes, where a learning principal seeks to optimally influence the agent's action policy for their common interests through a set of payment rules contingent on the realization of next state. For the planning problem, we design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal contracts against the far-sighted agent. For the learning problem, we introduce a generic design of no-regret learning algorithms to untangle the challenges from robust design of contracts to the balance of exploration and exploitation, reducing the complexity analysis to the construction of efficient search algorithms. For several natural classes of problems, we design tailored search algorithms that provably achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We also present an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for the general problem that improves the existing analysis in online contract design with mild technical assumptions.</description>
