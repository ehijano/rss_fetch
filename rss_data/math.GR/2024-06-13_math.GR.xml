      <title>A novel approach to graph distinction through GENEOs and permutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) was initially developed in Topological Data Analysis for the geometric approximation of data observers, including their invariances and symmetries. This paper departs from that line of research and explores the use of GENEOs for distinguishing $r$-regular graphs up to isomorphisms. In doing so, we aim to test the capabilities and flexibility of these operators. Our experiments show that GENEOs offer a good compromise between efficiency and computational cost in comparing $r$-regular graphs, while their actions on data are easily interpretable. This supports the idea that GENEOs could be a general-purpose approach to discriminative problems in Machine Learning when some structural information about data and observers is explicitly given.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  As applications, we show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable, and in which the problem of solving quadratic equations is also undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>

      <title>The Attractor-Cycle Notation for Finite Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1138</link>
      <description>arXiv:1306.1138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new notation for finite transformations. This attractor-cycle notation extends the orbit-cycle notation for permutations and builds upon existing transformation notations. How the basins of attraction of a finite transformation flow into permuted orbit cycles is visible from the notation. It gives insight into the structure of transformations and reduces the length of expressions without increasing the number of types of symbols.</description>

      <title>On the geometry and bounded cohomology of racks and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a natural family of metrics on connected components of a rack. The metrics are closely related to certain bi-invariant metrics on the group of inner automorphisms of the rack. We also introduce a bounded cohomology of racks and quandles, relate them to the above metrics and prove a certain vanishing result for racks and quandles with amenable group of inner automorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the Modular Isomorphism Problem for 2-generated groups with cyclic derived subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the analysis of the Modular Isomorphism Problem for $2$-generated $p$-groups with cyclic derived subgroup, $p&gt;2$, started in [D. Garc\'ia-Lucas, \'A. del R\'io, and M. Stanojkovski. On group invariants determined by modular group algebras: even versus odd characteristic. Algebr. Represent. Theory. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10468-022-10182-x, 2022]. We show that if $G$ belongs to this class of groups, then the isomorphism type of the quotients $G/(G')^{p^3}$ and $G/\gamma_3(G)^p$ are determined by its modular group algebra. In fact, we obtain a more general but technical result, expressed in terms of the classification \cite{OsnelDiegoAngel}. We also show that for groups in this class of order at most $p^{11}$, the Modular Isomorphism Problem has positive answer. Finally, we describe some families of groups of order $p^{12}$ whose group algebras over the field with $p$ elements cannot be distinguished with the techniques available to us.</description>

      <title>A classification of $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-braces using bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ be a finite field of odd characteristic $p$. In this paper we give a classification, up to isomorphism, of the associative commutative $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-algebras, starting from the connection with their bi-brace structure. Such classification is the generalization in odd characteristic of the result proved by Civino at al. in characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>On Finite Presentability of Subsemigroups of the Monogenic Free Inverse Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monogenic free inverse semigroup $FI_1$ is not finitely presented as a semigroup due to the classic result by Schein (1975). We extend this result and prove that a finitely generated subsemigroup of $FI_1$ is finitely presented if and only if it contains only finitely many idempotents. As a consequence, we derive that an inverse subsemigroup of $FI_1$ is finitely presented as a semigroup if and only if it is a finite semilattice.</description>

      <title>On spherical Deligne complexes of type $D_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be the Artin complex of the Artin group of type $D_n$. This complex is also called the spherical Deligne complex of type $D_n$. We show certain types of 6-cycles in the 1-skeleton of $\Delta$ either have a center, which is a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the 6-cycle, or a quasi-center, which is a vertex adjacent to three of the alternating vertices of the 6-cycle. This will be a key ingredient in proving $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for several classes of Artin groups in a companion article.
  As a consequence, we also deduce that certain 2-dimensional relative Artin complex inside the $D_n$-type Artin complex, endowed with the induced Moussong metric, is CAT$(1)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Families of Association Schemes on Triples from Two-Transitive Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Association schemes on triples (ASTs) are ternary analogues of classical association schemes. Analogous to Schurian association schemes, ASTs arise from the actions of two-transitive groups. In this paper, we obtain the sizes and third valencies of the ASTs obtained from the two-transitive permutation groups by determining the orbits of the groups' two-point stabilizers. Specifically, we obtain these parameters for the ASTs obtained from the actions of $S_n$ and $A_n$, $PGU(3,q)$, $PSU(3,q)$, and $Sp(2k,2)$, $Sz(2^{2k+1})$ and $Ree(3^{2k+1})$, some subgroups of $A\Gamma L(k,n)$, some subgroups of $P\Gamma L(k,n)$, and the sporadic two-transitive groups. Further, we obtain the intersection numbers for the ASTs obtained from these subgroups of $P\Gamma L(k,n)$ and $A \Gamma L(k,n)$, and the sporadic two-transitive groups. In particular, the ASTs from these projective and sporadic groups are commutative.</description>
