      <title>The Existential Theory of the Reals as a Complexity Class: A Compendium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the complexity class $\exists \mathbb{R}$, which captures the complexity of deciding the existential theory of the reals. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has roots in two different traditions, one based on the Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation, and the other following work by Mn\"{e}v and Shor on the universality of realization spaces of oriented matroids. Over the years the number of problems for which $\exists \mathbb{R}$ rather than NP has turned out to be the proper way of measuring their complexity has grown, particularly in the fields of computational geometry, graph drawing, game theory, and some areas in logic and algebra. $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has also started appearing in the context of machine learning, Markov decision processes, and probabilistic reasoning.
  We have aimed at collecting a comprehensive compendium of problems complete and hard for $\exists \mathbb{R}$, as well as a long list of open problems. The compendium is presented in the third part of our survey; a tour through the compendium and the areas it touches on makes up the second part. The first part introduces the reader to the existential theory of the reals as a complexity class, discussing its history, motivation and prospects as well as some technical aspects.</description>

      <title>Shellability is hard even for balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to show that shellability is NP-hard for triangulated d-balls (this also gives hardness for triangulated d-manifolds/d-pseudomanifolds with boundary) as soon as d is at least 3. This extends our earlier work with Goaoc, Pat\'akov\'a and Wagner on hardness of shellability of 2-complexes and answers some questions implicitly raised by Danaraj and Klee in 1978 and explicitly mentioned by Santamar\'ia-Galvis and Woodroofe. Together with the main goal, we also prove that collapsibility is NP-hard for 3-complexes embeddable in the 3-space, extending an earlier work of the second author and answering an open question mentioned by Cohen, Fasy, Miller, Nayyeri, Peng and Walkington; and that shellability is NP-hard for 2-complexes embeddable in the 3-space, answering another question of Santamar\'ia-Galvis and Woodroofe (in a slightly stronger form than what is given by the main result).</description>

      <title>Certified simultaneous isotopic approximation of curves via subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm based on subdivision for computing an isotopic approximation to any number of curves in the plane. Our algorithm is based on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter. The main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify and isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of our output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves is to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the details of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the number of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case bounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.</description>
