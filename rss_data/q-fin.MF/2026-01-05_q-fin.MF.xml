      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion on the circle and a stochastic correlation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop diffusion models for time-varying correlation using stochastic processes defined on the unit circle. Specifically, we study Brownian motion on the circle and the von Mises diffusion, and propose their use as continuous-time models for correlation dynamics. The von Mises process, introduced by Kent (1975) as a characterization of the von Mises distribution in circular statistics, does not have a known closed-form transition density, which has limited its use in likelihood-based inference. We derive an accurate analytical approximation to the transition density of the von Mises diffusion, enabling practical likelihood-based estimation. We study inference for discretely observed circular diffusions, establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators, and propose a stochastic correlation model for financial applications. The methodology is illustrated through simulation studies and empirical applications to equity-foreign exchange market data.</description>
