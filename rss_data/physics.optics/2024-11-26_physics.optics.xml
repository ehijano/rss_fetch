      <title>Silicon-Enhanced Nanocavity: From Narrow Band Color Reflector to Broadband Near-Infrared Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength-scale light absorbers and reflectors have gained significant attention for their potential in photonic applications. These structures often utilize a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) architecture, similar to a Fabry-Perot nanocavity, using noble metals and dielectric or semiconductor spacers for narrow-band light absorption. In reflection mode, they function as band-stop filters, blocking specific wavelengths and reflecting others through Fabry-Perot resonance. Efficient color reflection requires asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavities, where metals with differing reflectivities and extinction coefficients enable substantial reflection for non-resonant wavelengths and near-perfect absorption at resonant ones. Unlike narrowband techniques, broadband absorption does not rely on a single resonance phenomenon. Recent developments show that integrating an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity with an anti-reflection coating achieves near-unity absorption across a broad wavelength range. This study introduces an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity with a dielectric-semiconductor-dielectric spacer, enabling near-unity color reflection. By incorporating silicon, the reflected color can be tuned with just a 5 nm thickness variation, while achieving broadband absorption over 70% in the 800-1600 nm range. The addition of an anti-reflection coating extends broadband absorption to near unity with minimal impact on reflected color. The planar, nanopattern-free design holds promise for display technologies with better color fidelity and applications in thermal photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Fully integrated hybrid multimode-multiwavelength photonic processor with picosecond latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed signal processing is essential for maximizing data throughput in emerging communication applications, like multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and radio-frequency (RF) interference cancellation. However, as these technologies scale, they increase hardware complexity, computing power demands, and create significant digital signal processing (DSP) challenges. While transistor miniaturization has improved digital electronic processors, they still face physical bottlenecks, limiting computational throughput and increasing DSP latency. Photonic processors present a promising alternative, offering large bandwidth, low loss, parallel processing, and low latency. Yet, scalability in photonic processors remains limited by system integration, device size, and on-chip multiplexing challenges. Here, we introduce a scalable on-chip hybrid multiplexed photonic processor, combining mode-division multiplexing (MDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). This marks the first implementation of a monolithically integrated MDM-WDM-compatible processor, featuring mode multiplexers, multimode microring resonators, and multimode balanced photodetectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time unscrambling of 5 Gb/s non-return-to-zero optical MIMO signals and RF phase-shift keying signal unjamming. Our system's 30 ps processing latency makes it ideal for real-time MIMO and RF applications. Our analysis reveals that hybrid MDM-WDM multiplexing improves the number of operations per second by 4.1 times over spatially multiplexed WDM configurations, positioning it as a strong candidate for next-generation large-scale photonic processors.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>On-chip 7 GHz acousto-optic modulators for visible wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chip-integrated acousto-optic phase modulator tailored for visible optical wavelengths has been developed. Utilizing the lithium niobate on sapphire platform, the modulator employs a 7 GHz surface acoustic wave, excited by an interdigital transducer and aligned perpendicular to the waveguide. This design achieves efficient phase modulation of visible light within a compact device length of merely 200 microns, while holds the advantages of easy fabrication and high stability due to simple unsuspended structure. Remarkably, in this high-frequency acoustic regime, the acoustic wavelength becomes comparable to the optical wavelength, resulting in a notable single-sideband modulation behavior. This observation underscores the phase delay effects in the acousto-optics interactions, and opens up new aspects for realizing functional visible photonic devices and its integration with atom- and ion-based quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic modulation based on an AlScN microring resonator for microwave-to-optical conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic-optic (AO) modulation is critical for microwave and optical signal processing, computing and networking. Challenges remain to integrate AO devices on-chip using fabrication process compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This work presents the demonstration of an AO modulator exploiting a microring resonator (MRR) based on thin-film aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) photonic platform. Leveraging the high piezoelectric properties of AlScN, an MRR is employed with interdigital transducer (IDT) inside to couple microwave signals into acoustic resonant modes, enabling efficient by-directional optical modulation in the MRR. The fabricated MRR exhibits an optical loaded quality factor (Q) of 1.8*e4 at the optical L-band for the TE00 mode. A low effective half-wave voltage Vpi of 1.21 V is achieved, corresponding to a VpiL of 0.0242 Vcm, along with an optomechanical single-photon coupling strength g0 of 0.43 kHz between the 2.11 GHz acoustic mode and the TE00 optical mode. The device shows potential for applications in microwave photonics.</description>

      <title>Modeling of optical scattering from topographic surface measurements of high-quality mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit computational methods to obtain an angular profile of optical scattering from a smooth surface, given a two-dimensional map of topographic height errors of the surface. Quick derivations of some traditional equations and relevant references are organized to shorten the search time. A practical data-processing flow of the methods is discussed. As a case study of this flow, the core mirrors of the KAGRA interferometer are examined, and we obtain a representative scattering profile that is easily applicable to ray-tracing simulations.</description>

      <title>Enabling low threshold laser through an asymmetric tetramer metasurface harnessing polarization-independent quasi-BICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically demonstrate a novel strategy to achieve dual-band symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) based on a nanodisk tetramer metasurface for lasing generation. The method involves breaking the in-plane symmetry along the diagonal of the metasurface unit cell by introducing air holes in the tetramers. Through our simulations, we show that this flexible approach enables the support of dual-band BICs in the telecom-band range, with these modes evolving into quasi-BICs with remarkably high quality factors by breaking the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, the ultracompact device exhibits the unique characteristic of being polarization-independent across all viewing angles. Finally, the optically pumped gain medium provides sufficient optical gain to compensate the quasi-BIC mode losses, enabling two mode lasing with ultra-low pump threshold and very narrow optical linewidth in the telecom-band range. Our adaptable device paves the way for polarization-insensitive metasurfaces with multiple lasing resonances. This innovation holds the potential to transform areas like low-threshold lasing and biosensing by delivering improved performance and broader capabilities.</description>

      <title>High-Performances AlGaN-based DUV-LED via Under-Level Multiple Quantum Well Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low internal and external quantum efficiencies in high Aluminium content AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) occurred due to strong polarization effects, spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, at the interface between two materials. It also leads to a low carrier confinement and Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE), contributing to the efficiency droop of the DUV-LED. This work demonstrates an under-level MQW configuration implemented in a DUV-LED with a 257 nm emission wavelength. Three DUV-LED structures, above-, same- and under-level MQW were investigated, covering important optoelectronics properties such as energy band diagram, carrier concentrations, radiative recombination rates and electric field distribution. It is found that the quantum efficiencies, luminescence intensity and light output power of the under-level configuration has been enhanced by nine-, ten- and five-folds, relative to the above-level MQW configuration.</description>

      <title>Tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like effect due to coupling of dual-band bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between dual-band or multi-band quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) is of great interest for their rich physics and promising applications. Here, we report tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like (EIT-like) phenomenon due to coupling between dual-band collective electric dipolar and magnetic quadrupolar q-BICs, which are supported by an all-dielectric metasurface composed of periodic tilted silicon quadrumers. We show that this collective EIT-like phenomenon with strong slow light effect can be realized by varying the nanodisk diameter or the tilt angle, and that the transparency window wavelength, the quality factor, and the group index can all be tuned by changing the nanodisk size. We further find that as the nanodisk size decreases, the slow light effect becomes stronger, and higher sensitivity can be obtained for the refractive index sensing. Interestingly, the sensitivity first increases exponentially and then reaches a plateau as the nanodisk size decreases, or equivalently as the group index increases. We therefore expect this work will advance the understanding of the collective EIT-like effect due to coupling between q-BICs, and the findings will have potential applications in slow-light enhanced biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal optical metasurface based on spinning cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical systems breaking Lorentz reciprocity have attracted broad attention due to their intriguing physics and applications. Nonreciprocal metasurfaces can enable one-way light transmission and reflection with essential applications in optical communication. Conventional nonreciprocal metasurfaces rely on using magneto-optic or nonlinear materials to induce nonreciprocal optical properties. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal metasurfaces based on the relativistic effect of a moving medium. The metasurface is composed of periodic spinning dielectric cylinders located above a dielectric substrate. The spinning motion breaks the time-reversal symmetry and induces bi-anisotropic Tellegen-type response of the meta-atoms. We show that the metasurface can realize both asymmetric and nonreciprocal manipulations of the incident plane wave. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the Sagnac effect associated with the chiral multipole modes of the coupled spinning cylinders. By introducing dielectric pillars to modulate the phase profile, the metasurface can enable nonreciprocal wavefront manipulations. Our work offers a new mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal light manipulation in free space. The proposed metasurface can serve as a platform to explore the interesting physics of nonreciprocal optics, non-Hermitian optics, and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Photonic Temporal Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Colour Centres in Nanodiamonds as Standard Candle References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative and reproducible optical characterization of single quantum emitters is crucial for quantum photonic materials research, yet controlling for experimental conditions remains challenging due to a lack of an established reference standard. We propose nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) color centers as reliable, stable and robust sources of single-photon emission. We select 4 potential reference emitter candidates from a study of thousands of NV$^{-}$ centers. Candidates were remeasured at a second laboratory, correlating optical pump power and NV$^{-}$ center emission intensity at saturation in addition to corresponding $g^{(2)}(0)$ values. A reference nanodiamond is demonstrated to control for experimental conditions, with reproducible and reliable single-photon emission, as a model for a new single-photon emitter reference standard.</description>

      <title>Coherent Ising Machine Based on Polarization Symmetry Breaking in a Driven Kerr Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-multiplexed networks of degenerate optical parametric oscillators have demonstrated remarkable success in simulating coupled Ising spins, thus providing a promising route to solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. In these systems $\unicode{x2014}$ referred to as coherent Ising machines $\unicode{x2014}$ the spins are encoded in the phases of the oscillators, and spin states are measured at the system output using phase-sensitive techniques. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a conceptually new optical Ising machine based upon spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking within a coherently-driven optical fibre Kerr nonlinear resonator. In our scheme, the spin states are encoded using polarization, which allows the state of the network to be robustly read out using straightforward intensity measurements. Furthermore, by operating within a recently-discovered regime where the interplay between nonlinearity and topology fundamentally safeguards the system's symmetry, we ensure that our spins evolve without unwanted biases. This enables continuous Ising machine trials at optical data rates for up to an hour without resetting or manual adjustments. With an all-fibre implementation that relies solely on standard telecommunications components, we believe our work paves the way for substantial advances in the performance and stability of coherent optical Ising machines for applications ranging from financial modeling to drug discovery and machine learning.</description>

      <title>GHz fundamental mode-locking of a highly integrated Er-doped all-fiber ring laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High repetition rate ultrafast fiber lasers are important tools for both fundamental science and industry applications. However, achieving over GHz repetition rate in passively mode-locked fiber ring lasers is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel all-integrated Er-doped fiber ring laser that achieves over GHz fundamental repetition rate, passively mode-locked by carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first passively mode-locked GHz all-fiber laser with ring cavity configuration. In the proposed laser oscillator, all functions are integrated into one device, making it an ultra-compact laser cavity. The laser produces ultrafast optical pulses at 1562 nm, with a pulse width of 682 fs and a fundamental repetition rate of 1.028 GHz. The stable mode-locking is characterized by high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiofrequency signal and low relative intensity noise (RIN).</description>

Abstract: The development of deep neural networks is witnessing fast growth in network size, which requires novel hardware computing platforms with large bandwidth and low energy consumption. Optical computing has been a potential candidate for next-generation computing systems. Specifically, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) has been widely adopted in optical neural network architecture to increase the computation bandwidth. Although existing WDM neural networks architectures have shown promise, they face challenges in the integration of light sources and further increase of the computing bandwidth. To overcome these issues, we introduce a mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy, offering a new degree of freedom in optical computing within the micro-ring resonator platform. We propose a MDM approach for small-scale networks and a multi-dimensional architecture for large-scale applications, supplementing WDM with MDM to enhance channel capacity for computations. In this work, we design and experimentally demonstrate key components for the MDM computing system, i.e., a multimode beam splitter, a thermo-optical tuner for the high-order mode, and a multimode waveguide bend. We further show a 2-by-2 matrix multiplexing system fabricated in a foundry that works for both MDM and MDM-WDM computing, which confirms that our approach successfully increases the input vector size for computing and ensures compatibility with existing WDM networks.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic recurrent neural network using optical-electrical-optical converters with RC delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural network (ONN) has been attracting intense attention owing to their low latency and low-power consumption. Among the ONNs, optical recurrent neural network (RNN) enables low-power and high-speed time-series data processing using a compact loop structure. The loop losses need to be efficiently compensated so that the time-series information is maintained in the RNN operation. For this purpose, we focus on the optoelectronic RNN (OE-RNN) with optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters to compensate for the loop losses. However, the effect of resistive-capacitive (RC) delay of OEO converters on the RNN performance is unclear. Here, we study in simulation an OE-RNN equipped with OEO converters with RC delay. We confirm that our modeled OE-RNN achieves the high training accuracy of time-series data classification even when RC delay is comparably large to the time interval of time-series data. Our analyses reveal that the accumulation of time-series data by RC delay does not degrade the RNN performance but rather can compensate for the degraded RNN performance due to loop losses. From the theoretical analysis referring to the gradient explosion and vanishing problems, we find the region related to loss and RC delay where the high training accuracy can be achieved. In simulation, we confirm this compensation effect in the large OE-RNN circuit up to 32$\times$32 scale. Our proposed scheme opens a new way of time-series data processing by utilizing RC delay for the optical computing and optical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compositional asymmetry of Janus micro- and nanoparticles gives unprecedented opportunities to manipulate such composite particles with different stimuli to achieve enhanced optical, magnetic and photothermal responses, which can be exploited for sensing, phototherapy, and nanoscale robotic applications. This perspective overviews recent advances in optical manipulation of plasmonic Janus particles and their implications for biomedical applications. In particular, a brief summary of optical, plasmonic, and magnetic manipulation of Janus particles of various compositions are presented. Moreover, the potentials of plasmonic and magnetic Janus particles for targeted drug delivery, photothermal therapy, enhanced hyperthermia, and neuromodulation are briefly discussed. Finally, a perspective on the rational design and applications of this particular family of asymmetric particles is forwarded.</description>

      <title>Radiation Pattern Synthesis with Uniform Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main applications of electromagnetic metasurfaces (MSs) is to tailor spatial field distributions. The radiation pattern of a given source can be desirably modified upon reflection on an MS having proper spatial modulation of its local macroscopic parameters. At the microscopic level, spatial modulation requires individually engineered meta-atoms at different points. In contrast, the present research demonstrates the opportunity for radiation pattern engineering in the reflection regime without using any spatial modulation. The principle consists in the deliberate tailoring of the surface impedance of an unmodulated but spatially dispersive (nonlocal) MS. A 2D synthesis problem with a magnetic line current source is solved analytically by finding a required form of the surface impedance as a function of the tangential wave vector in both visible and evanescent parts of the spatial spectrum. To prove the principle, three different pattern shapes are implemented via full-wave numerical simulations by tuning the spatial dispersion in a realistic mushroom-type high-impedance electromagnetic surface with loaded vias. This work extends the synthesis methods and the application area of spatially dispersive MSs, showing the latter as a promising platform for new types of antennas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient edge couplers by fabricating a 3D mode size converter on a lithium niobate-on-insulator photonic platform. The 3D mode size converter is fabricated using an etching process that employs a Si external mask to provide height variation and adjust the width variation through tapering patterns via lithography. The measured edge coupling efficiency with a 3D mode size converter was approximately 1.16 dB/facet for the TE mode and approximately 0.71 dB/facet for the TM mode at a wavelength of 1550 nm.</description>

      <title>Steerable dual-trap optical tweezers with confocal position detection using back-scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers has emerged as a powerful tool in manipulating microscopic particles and in measuring weak forces of the order of a pico-Newton. As a result, it has found wide applications ranging from material science to biology. Dual-trap optical tweezers (DTOT) are of particular importance as they allow for two point correlation measurements as in molecular force spectroscopy, two-point active micro-rheology, etc. Here we report a novel design for a steerable DTOT setup which uses back-scattered light from the two traps for position detection. This is performed using a confocal scheme where the two detectors are placed at the conjugate points to the respective traps. This offers several significant advantages over current designs, such as, zero cross-talk between signals, single module assembly and robustness to thermal drift. Moreover, our design can be very easily integrated with standard microscopy techniques like Phase contrast and Differential Interference Contrast, without modifying the microscope illumination unit.</description>

      <title>Temporal synthesis of optical nonlinearity through synergy of spectrally-tuneable electron and phonon dynamics in a metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating intensity, phase and polarization of the electromagnetic fields on ultrafast timescales is essential for all-optical switching, optical information processing and development of novel time-variant media. Noble metal based plasmonics has provided numerous platforms for optical switching and control, enabled by strong local field enhancement, artificially engineered dispersion and strong Kerr-type free-electron nonlinearities. However, precise control over switching times and spectrum remains challenging, commonly limited by the relaxation of hot-electron gas on picosecond time scales and the band structure of materials. Here we experimentally demonstrate the strong and tuneable nonlinearity in a metamaterial on a mirror geometry, controlled by the wavelength of excitation, which imprints a specific non-uniform hot-electron population distribution and drives targeted electron and lattice dynamics. The interplay of electromagnetic, electronic and mechanical energy exchange allows us to achieve sub-300~fs timescales in the recovery of optical constants in the selected spectral domains, where the modulation surpasses the limitations imposed by the inherent material response of metamaterial components, owing to emergence of a Fano-type destructive interference with acoustic vibrations of the metamaterial, featured in reflection but not in transmission. The observed effects are highly spectrally selective and sensitive to the polarisation properties of light and the Fabry-Perot modes of the metamaterial, opening a pathway for controlling the switching rates by spectral selection and nanostructure design. The capability to manipulate temporal, spectral and mechanical aspects of light-matter interactions underscores new potential nonlinear applications where polarisation diversity, spectral selectivity and fast modulation are important.</description>

      <title>Supercontinuum generation in methane-filled hollow-core antiresonant fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of a multi-octave supercontinuum spanning from 350 nm to 1700 nm with exceptional spectral flatness and high conversion efficiency to both the visible and near infrared region, by pumping a methane-filled hollow-core antiresonant fiber with 1030 nm laser pulses. The dynamics exhibited signs of both modulational instability and stimulated Raman scattering. Fiber lengths ranging from 15 to 200~cm were investigated along with gas pressures up to 50 bar and pump pulse durations from 220~fs up to 10~ps. The best supercontinuum, in terms of spectral width and flatness, was achieved with 220~fs pulses, 25~bar filling pressure, and 60~cm propagation length. Comparison with argon-filled fiber with matched nonlinearity and dispersion showed that the Raman contribution enhances the supercontinuum generation process compared to a pure modulational instability-based process. The average power was scaled up by increasing the pulse repetition rate to 50~kHz, but further scaling was hindered by linear and nonlinear absorption leading to fiber damage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical cavities, with nonlinear photon-phonon interactions, offer a more compact approach to chaos generation than conventional feedback-based optical systems. However, proper study on long-distance chaos synchronization of two optomechanical cavities connected by a long optical fiber is still unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate all-optical complete synchronization between unidirectionally coupled optomechanical cavities. Traditionally, achieving complete synchronization in nonlinear coupled oscillators and in optical systems necessitates identical systems. Our findings, which arise naturally from the fundamental mathematical properties of optomechanical cavities, demonstrate that parameter heterogeneity can, in fact, not only enable complete synchronization but make it stable.</description>

Abstract: Despite its potential for label-free particle diagnostics, holographic microscopy is limited by specialized processing methods that struggle to generalize across diverse settings. We introduce a deep learning architecture leveraging human perception of longitudinal variation of diffracted patterns of particles, which enables highly generalizable analysis of 3D particle information with orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed. Trained with minimal synthetic and real holograms of simple particles, our method demonstrates exceptional performance on various challenging cases including those with high particle concentrations and noises and a wide range of particle sizes, complex shapes, and optical properties exceeding the diversity of the training datasets.</description>

Abstract: Fiber-based long-haul quantum communication would greatly benefit from a robust and deterministically integrated source of quantum state. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of InAs/InP quantum dots in the InP H1 point defect 2D photonic crystal cavity, integrated with the standard single-mode fiber using a micro-transfer printing technique. The device was placed in a compact cryocooler maintaining a cryogenic temperature of 15 K with single-photon emission characterized by $g^{(2)}(0)=0.14(14)$ and reliable and stable emission (intensity fluctuations given by a standard deviation $\sigma = 0.13$), so that an all-fiber based connection between two laboratory nodes through an open area was established and utilized for testing the quantum channel. In this way, we demonstrate a plug-and-play all-fiber single-photon source operating in the third telecom window, where standard telecommunication fiber networks can be used as a low-loss medium.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear nanocavity exciton-polaritons in gate-tunable monolayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between light and matter in an optical cavity provides a pathway to giant polariton nonlinearity, where effective polariton-polariton interactions are mediated by materials' nonlinear responses. The pursuit of such enhanced nonlinearity at low optical excitations, potentially down to the single-particle level, has been a central focus in the field, inspiring the exploration of novel solid-state light-matter systems. Here, we experimentally realize extremely nonlinear and robust cavity exciton-polaritons by coupling a charge-tunable MoSe2 monolayer to a photonic crystal nanocavity. We show that the observed polariton nonlinearity arises from increased exciton dephasing at high populations, leading to diminished exciton-photon coupling and ultimately the breakdown of the strong coupling condition. Remarkably, the strong mode confinement of the nanocavity enables all-optical switching of the cavity spectrum at ultralow optical excitation energies, down to ~4 fJ, on picosecond timescales. Our work paves the way for further exploration of 2D nonlinear exciton-polaritons, with promising applications in both classical and quantum all-optical information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro and nanoscale particles are crucial in various fields, from biomedical imaging to environmental processes. While conventional spectroscopy and microscopy methods for characterizing these particles often involve bulky equipment and complex sample preparation, optical micro-sensors have emerged as a promising alternative. However, their broad applicability is limited by the need for surface binding and difficulty in differentiating between sensing targets. This study introduces an optofluidic, high-throughput optical microresonator sensor that captures subtle acoustic signals generated by particles absorbing pulsed light energy. This novel approach enables real-time, label-free detection and interrogation of particles and cells in their native environments across an extended sensing volume. By leveraging unique optical absorption properties, our technique selectively detects and classifies flowing particles without surface binding, even in complex matrices like whole blood samples. We demonstrate the measurement of gold nanoparticles with diverse geometries and different species of red blood cells amidst other cellular elements and proteins. These particles are identified and classified based on their photoacoustic fingerprint, which captures shape, composition, and morphology features. This work opens new avenues for rapid, reliable, and high-throughput particle and cell identification in clinical and industrial applications, offering a valuable tool for understanding complex biological and environmental systems.</description>

      <title>Faithful quantum teleportation via a nanophotonic nonlinear Bell state analyzer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking protocols, including quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping, use linear-optical Bell state measurements for heralding the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, a linear-optical Bell state measurement requires identical photons and is susceptible to errors caused by multiphoton emission, fundamentally limiting the efficiency and fidelity of quantum networking protocols. Here we show a nonlinear Bell state analyzer for time-bin encoded photons based on a nanophotonic cavity with efficient sum-frequency generation to filter multiphoton emissions, and utilize it for faithful quantum teleportation involving spectrally distinct photons with fidelities $\geq 94\%$ down to the single-photon level. Our result demonstrates that nonlinear-optical entangling operations, empowered by our efficient nanophotonics platform, can realize faithful quantum information protocols without requiring identical photons and without the fundamental limit on the efficiency and fidelity of a Bell state measurement imposed by linear optics, which facilitates the realization of practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Large tuning of the optical properties of nanoscale NdNiO3 via electron doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesized crystalline films of neodymium nickel oxide (NdNiO3), a perovskite quantum material, switched the films from a metal phase (intrinsic) into an insulator phase (electron-doped) by field-driven lithium-ion intercalation, and characterized their structural and optical properties. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A leaky wave antenna based on spin photonic topological insulators has been developed, featuring a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This configuration offers advantages over the zigzag arrangement, particularly with its wider leaky region and more suitable pattern. While the proposed antenna is a uniform leaky wave antenna, it is capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, the transition through the broadside in the scanning range does not result in a significant drop in performance, despite the presence of an open stop band. This characteristic is unique among leaky wave antennas, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>You only thermoelastically deform once: Point Absorber Detection in LIGO Test Masses with YOLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and future gravitational-wave observatories rely on large-scale, precision interferometers to detect the gravitational-wave signals. However, microscopic imperfections on the test masses, known as point absorbers, cause problematic heating of the optic via absorption of the high-power laser beam, which results in diminished sensitivity, lock loss, or even permanent damage. Consistent monitoring of the test masses is crucial for detecting, characterizing, and ultimately removing point absorbers. We present a machine-learning algorithm for detecting point absorbers based on the object-detection algorithm You Only Look Once (YOLO). The algorithm can perform this task in situ while the detector is in operation. We validate our algorithm by comparing it with past reports of point absorbers identified by humans at LIGO. The algorithm confidently identifies the same point absorbers as humans with minimal false positives. It also identifies some point absorbers previously not identified by humans, which we confirm with human follow-up. We highlight the potential of machine learning in commissioning efforts.</description>

      <title>Simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy on a near-term quantum computer using a probe qubit protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes and long timescales involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on near-term quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spetroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-fidelity spatial mode quantum gates in high-dimensional space by diffractive deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the spatial mode of photons is widely used in quantum cryptography, its potential for quantum computation remains largely unexplored. Here, we showcase the use of the multi-dimensional spatial mode of photons to construct a series of high-dimensional quantum gates, achieved through the use of diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs). Notably, our gates demonstrate high fidelity of up to 99.6(2)%, as characterized by quantum process tomography. Our experimental implementation of these gates involves a programmable array of phase layers in a compact and scalable device, capable of performing complex operations or even quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the D2NN gates by successfully implementing the Deutsch algorithm and propose an intelligent deployment protocol that involves self-configuration and self-optimization. Moreover, we conduct a comparative analysis of the D2NN gate's performance to the wave-front matching approach. Overall, our work opens a door for designing specific quantum gates using deep learning, with the potential for reliable execution of quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Taylor expansions for the imaging and timing characteristics of spherical optical systems with infinitesimal mirror facets, sometimes referred to as ''modified Davies-Cotton'' telescopes. Such a system comprises a discontinuous spherical mirror surface whose curvature radius is different from its focal length, and whose mirrors are aligned to suppress spherical aberration. Configurations that range between two ''optima'' are, one of which minimises tangential comatic aberration and the other that minimises timing dispersion.</description>

      <title>Emerging optical spin and chirality by 3D evanescent field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical spin and chirality play key roles in engineering photonic emission and light-matter interactions. Here we show that 3D evanescent coupling of guided modes by strongly confined waveguides can extrinsically produce optical spin and chirality. These emerging optical quantities are essentially derived from an intrinsic phase retardation of {\pi}/2 between two coupled modes. For a directional coupler with 2*2 input ports, the produced optical spin and chirality are inherently characterized by the side-locked and path-locked phenomena, respectively. We numerically demonstrate that these optical spin and chirality can be ubiquitously produced by higher-order mode coupling and other structural waveguides. These new quantities in optical waveguides may pave the way to exploit near-field photonic spin and on-chip chiral light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: The derivation of a function is a fundamental tool for solving problems in calculus. Consequently, the motivations for investigating physical systems capable of performing this task are numerous. Furthermore, the potential to develop an optical computer to replace conventional computers has led us to create an optical algorithm and propose an experimental setup for implementing the derivative of one-dimensional real-valued functions using a paraxial and monochromatic laser beam. To complement the differentiation algorithm, we have experimentally implemented a novel optical algorithm that can transfer a two-dimensional phase-encoded function to the intensity profile of a light beam. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement the n-th derivative of functions encoded in the phase of the transverse profile of photons.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive study on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical modelling of space- and time-varying media is presented. We investigate the dynamic behavior of oblique incidence of both TM and TE electromagnetic fields on space-timemodulated gratings. In their general form, these media have electrical permittivity, magnetic permeability, and electrical conductivity modulated across both space and time. We provide the FDTDschemes, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition and equations for both TM and TE wave illuminations of space-time-varying slabs, along with the boundary conditions for the FDTD scheme. Furthermore, with engaging illustrative examples, we showcase the versatility and applications of space-time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Method of measuring the chromatic dispersion parameter of optical fibers using a single-arm interferometer and a fiber femtosecond frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a method for measuring the chromatic dispersion parameter (D) of optical fibers and bulk optical elements through the use of a single-arm three-wave interferometer and a fiber femtosecond frequency comb (FFFC). The FFFC is frequency locked to a single-ytterbium-ion optical standard and employed as a source of highly stable and broadband laser radiation. The FFFC spectrum ranges from 1 to 2 microns, which is the most demanded range in fiber optics. The theoretical model presented in the work is used to derive analytical expressions for the parameter D, taking into account the second-order group velocity dispersion. To validate the methodology, the parameter D is measured for a standard single-mode SMF-28 fiber. The proposed method enables the precise measurement of the parameter D with high accuracy across a broad spectral range in a relatively short time.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of InGaAs and GaAsSb Nanowires for Room Temperature Operation of Avalanche Photodiodes at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: III V semiconductor nanowire based photodetectors have significant potential for remote sensing and LiDAR applications, particularly due to their ability to operate at 1.55 {\mu}m. Achieving room temperature operation and near unity absorption using these nanowires at 1.55 {\mu}m is crucial for single photon detection, which offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by the existing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Key materials suited for this wavelength include lattice matched In0.53Ga0.47As and Ga0.5As0.5Sb to InP. This study reports a comparison between InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires to achieve high absorption efficiency at room temperature. Through optimized nanowire arrangement and geometry, we aim to maximize absorption. Our approach features a comparative analysis of patterned InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires with absorption characteristics modeled using finite difference time domain simulations to enhance absorption at the target wavelength. We also present the complete workflow for nanowire fabrication, modeling, and simulation, encompassing the production of tapered nanowire structures and measurement of their absorption efficiency. Our experimental results show that tapered InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires exhibit an absorption efficiency of 93% and 92%, respectively, at room temperature around 1.55 {\mu}m.</description>

Abstract: M\"ossbauer nuclei constitute exceptionally clean quantum-optical systems with transitions in the hard x-ray energy range, which, placed in x-ray waveguides, are a uniquely capable platform to study collective radiative effects in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this work, we design and demonstrate the so-far unexplored nuclear resonant x-ray propagation in thin-film waveguides coupled in forward incidence, resolving excitation and collective evolution of M\"ossbauer nuclei in both time and position. To describe the effects of geometry on propagation and collective evolution, we present a unifying theoretical model. Our findings not only open up a new design space for experiments in nuclear resonant scattering and nuclear quantum optics, but also demonstrate a nanometer-sized x-ray source with extreme temporal and spatial coherence. %which previously were limited to either unstructured foil samples or translation-invariant reflectivity and diffraction configurations. This gives access to a new regime of waveguide QED with hard x-rays and furthermore paves a new route to coherent spectro-microscopic investigations at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging holographic display technology offers unique capabilities for next-generation virtual reality systems. Current holographic near-eye displays, however, only support a small \'etendue, which results in a direct tradeoff between achievable field of view and eyebox size. \'Etendue expansion has recently been explored, but existing approaches are either fundamentally limited in the image quality that can be achieved or they require extremely high-speed spatial light modulators.
  We describe a new \'etendue expansion approach that combines multiple coherent sources with content-adaptive amplitude modulation of the hologram spectrum in the Fourier plane. To generate time-multiplexed phase and amplitude patterns for our spatial light modulators, we devise a pupil-aware gradient-descent-based computer-generated holography algorithm that is supervised by a large-baseline target light field. Compared with relevant baseline approaches, our method demonstrates significant improvements in image quality and \'etendue in simulation and with an experimental holographic display prototype.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gates are crucial for processing quantum information, but implementing them in a photonic platform poses unique challenges due to the peculiar way photons propagate and interfere. Here, we examine quantum photonic gates that utilize continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. In addition, we provide studying the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error-correction. This work advances the practical implementation photonic elements in linear optics quantum computation schemes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>
