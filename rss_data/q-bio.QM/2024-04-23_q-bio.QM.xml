      <title>Accelerating the Generation of Molecular Conformations with Progressive Distillation of Equivariant Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in fast sampling methods for diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential to accelerate generation on image modalities. We apply these methods to 3-dimensional molecular conformations by building on the recently introduced GeoLDM equivariant latent diffusion model (Xu et al., 2023). We evaluate trade-offs between speed gains and quality loss, as measured by molecular conformation structural stability. We introduce Equivariant Latent Progressive Distillation, a fast sampling algorithm that preserves geometric equivariance and accelerates generation from latent diffusion models. Our experiments demonstrate up to 7.5x gains in sampling speed with limited degradation in molecular stability. These results suggest this accelerated sampling method has strong potential for high-throughput in silico molecular conformations screening in computational biochemistry, drug discovery, and life sciences applications.</description>

      <title>A whole-body mathematical model of cholesterol metabolism and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. Increased levels of plasma cholesterol are consistently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As a result, it is imperative that studies are conducted to determine the best course of action to reduce whole-body cholesterol levels. A whole-body mathematical model for cholesterol metabolism and transport is proposed. The model can simulate the effects of lipid-lowering drugs like statins and anti-PCSK9. The model is based on ordinary differential equations and kinetic functions. It has been validated against literature data. It offers a versatile platform for designing personalized interventions for cardiovascular health management.</description>

      <title>Modeling principles for a physiology-based whole-body model of human metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physiological whole-body models are valuable tools for the development of novel drugs where understanding the system aspects is important. This paper presents a generalized model that encapsulates the structure and flow of whole-body human physiology. The model contains vascular, interstitial, and cellular subcompartments for each organ. Scaling of volumes and blood flows is described to allow for investigation across populations or specific patient groups. The model equations and the corresponding parameters are presented along with a catalog of functions that can be used to define the organ transport model and the biochemical reaction model. A simple example illustrates the procedure.</description>

      <title>DISC: Latent Diffusion Models with Self-Distillation from Separated Conditions for Prostate Cancer Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) can generate high-fidelity images from noise, offering a promising approach for augmenting histopathology images for training cancer grading models. While previous works successfully generated high-fidelity histopathology images using LDMs, the generation of image tiles to improve prostate cancer grading has not yet been explored. Additionally, LDMs face challenges in accurately generating admixtures of multiple cancer grades in a tile when conditioned by a tile mask. In this study, we train specific LDMs to generate synthetic tiles that contain multiple Gleason Grades (GGs) by leveraging pixel-wise annotations in input tiles. We introduce a novel framework named Self-Distillation from Separated Conditions (DISC) that generates GG patterns guided by GG masks. Finally, we deploy a training framework for pixel-level and slide-level prostate cancer grading, where synthetic tiles are effectively utilized to improve the cancer grading performance of existing models. As a result, this work surpasses previous works in two domains: 1) our LDMs enhanced with DISC produce more accurate tiles in terms of GG patterns, and 2) our training scheme, incorporating synthetic data, significantly improves the generalization of the baseline model for prostate cancer grading, particularly in challenging cases of rare GG5, demonstrating the potential of generative models to enhance cancer grading when data is limited.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>

      <title>Exploring tau protein and amyloid-beta propagation: a sensitivity analysis of mathematical models based on biological data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia worldwide. Its pathological development is well known to be connected with the accumulation of two toxic proteins: tau protein and amyloid-$\beta$. Mathematical models and numerical simulations can predict the spreading patterns of misfolded proteins in this context. However, the calibration of the model parameters plays a crucial role in the final solution. In this work, we perform a sensitivity analysis of heterodimer and Fisher-Kolmogorov models to evaluate the impact of the equilibrium values of protein concentration on the solution patterns. We adopt advanced numerical methods such as the IMEX-DG method to accurately describe the propagating fronts in the propagation phenomena in a polygonal mesh of sagittal patient-specific brain geometry derived from magnetic resonance images. We calibrate the model parameters using biological measurements in the brain cortex for the tau protein and the amyloid-$\beta$ in Alzheimer's patients and controls. Finally, using the sensitivity analysis results, we discuss the applicability of both models in the correct simulation of the spreading of the two proteins.</description>

      <title>Maximally informative feature selection using Information Imbalance: Application to COVID-19 severity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical databases typically include, for each patient, many heterogeneous features, for example blood exams, the clinical history before the onset of the disease, the evolution of the symptoms, the results of imaging exams, and many others. We here propose to exploit a recently developed statistical approach, the Information Imbalance, to compare different subsets of patient features, and automatically select the set of features which is maximally informative for a given clinical purpose, especially in minority classes. We adapt the Information Imbalance approach to work in a clinical framework, where patient features are often categorical and are generally available only for a fraction of the patients. We apply this algorithm to a data set of ~ 1,300 patients treated for COVID-19 in Udine hospital before October 2021. Using this approach, we find combinations of features which, if used in combination, are maximally informative of the clinical fate and of the severity of the disease. The optimal number of features, which is determined automatically, turns out to be between 10 and 15. These features can be measured at admission. The approach can be used also if the features are available only for a fraction of the patients, does not require imputation and, importantly, is able to automatically select features with small inter-feature correlation. Clinical insights deriving from this study are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Prot2Text: Multimodal Protein's Function Generation with GNNs and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of protein function prediction with the development of various machine-learning approaches. However, most existing methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e. assigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Prot2Text, which predicts a protein's function in a free text style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical classifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language Models(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates diverse data types including protein sequence, structure, and textual annotation and description. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of proteins' functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate functional descriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset from SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text. These results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models, specifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful tools for more accurate function prediction of existing as well as first-to-see proteins.</description>

      <title>GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this "diagnostic odyssey" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.</description>

      <title>Improved cryo-EM Pose Estimation and 3D Classification through Latent-Space Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses (projection angles and image shifts) in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D images is very challenging. In addition to these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction requires conformational classification. In popular cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms, poses and conformation classification labels must be predicted for every input cryo-EM image, which can be computationally costly for large datasets. An emerging class of methods adopted the amortized inference approach. In these methods, only a subset of the input dataset is needed to train neural networks for the estimation of poses and conformations. Once trained, these neural networks can make pose/conformation predictions and 3D reconstructions at low cost for the entire dataset during inference. Unfortunately, when facing heterogeneous reconstruction tasks, it is hard for current amortized-inference-based methods to effectively estimate the conformational distribution and poses from entangled latent variables. Here, we propose a self-supervised variational autoencoder architecture called "HetACUMN" based on amortized inference. We employed an auxiliary conditional pose prediction task by inverting the order of encoder-decoder to explicitly enforce the disentanglement of conformation and pose predictions. Results on simulated datasets show that HetACUMN generated more accurate conformational classifications than other amortized or non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we show that HetACUMN is capable of performing heterogeneous 3D reconstructions of a real experimental dataset.</description>
