      <title>Resonant microtaper leaky-mode computational spectropolarimetry with tens of femtometers spectral resolution and full stokes measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging computational measurement techniques for acquiring multi-dimensional optical field information, such as spectrum and polarization, are rapidly advancing and offer promising solutions for realizing high-performance miniature systems. The performance of these computational measurement approaches is critically influenced by the choice of random media, yet a general framework for evaluating different implementations remains absent. Here, we propose a universal analytical model for computational measurement systems and reveal that the system resolution is fundamentally determined by the maximum optical path difference (OPD) permitted within the random medium. Building on this theoretical foundation, we present a resonant leaky-mode (RLM) spectropolarimeter that achieves a record high resolution-footprint-product metric. The RLM spectropolarimeter leverages the complex coupling between leaky modes in a tapered coreless optical fiber and whispering-gallery modes (WGM) of microsphere to significantly enhance the maximum OPD within a compact footprint. We simultaneously achieve an ultrahigh spectral resolution of 0.02 pm, a spectral measurement bandwidth of 150 nm, and full-Stokes polarization measurement with an accuracy of $4.732 \times 10^{-6}$, all within a sub-square-millimeter footprint. The proposed theoretical model clarifies the key factors governing the performance of computational measurement systems based on random media and may inspires novel design of advanced computational measurement systems for optical field. The demonstrated RLM spectropolarimeter offers a potential approach for highly integrated, high-performance multi-dimensional optical field measurement.</description>

      <title>Expressive and Unclonable Photonic Circuits Based on Disordered Moir\'e Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural symmetry in photonics has long been exploited to engineer devices with predictable, analytically describable behaviors. Yet this predictability often limits their expressivity, constraining complex interactions essential for advanced functionalities in computing, sensing, and security. Here we demonstrate how low symmetry integrated photonic circuits can unlock enhanced mode diversity and rich spectral complexity, enabling highly non-linear transformations of input signals into outputs. Our devices, physically unclonable moir\'e quasicrystal interferometers integrated on a silicon photonics platform, exhibit aperiodic and reconfigurable spectral responses and are characterized by analyticity breaking and erasable mutual information. Using dynamic thermo-optic control to drive their complex spectral dynamics, we demonstrate that these devices function as reconfigurable physical unclonable functions (rPUFs). We also highlight their ability to perform high-dimensional input--output transformations, emulating reservoir-inspired information processing in a compact photonic platform. This work bridges the gap between engineered and natural complexity in photonic systems, revealing new opportunities for scalable, energy-efficient, and information-dense opto-electronics with applications in secure communications, hardware security, advanced sensing, and optical information processing. Our results establish low-symmetry integrated photonics as a powerful resource for complex signal manipulation in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Circulating tumor cell detection in cancer patients using in-flow deep learning holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells found in the bloodstream that serve as biomarkers for early cancer detection, prognostication, and disease monitoring. However, CTC detection remains challenging due to low cell abundance and heterogeneity. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) offers a promising, label-free method for high-throughput CTC identification by capturing superior morphological information compared to traditional imaging methods, while remaining compatible with in-flow data acquisition. We present a streamlined DHM-based system that integrates microfluidic enrichment with deep learning-driven image analysis, supplemented by immunofluorescent profiling, to improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC enumeration. Specifically, our platform combines inertial microfluidic preprocessing with dual-modality imaging, integrating holography with fluorescence sensing of up to two markers. A deep learning model, trained on a diverse set of healthy blood samples and cancer cell lines, and executed in real-time, provides a morphological confidence on a cell-by-cell basis that may then be combined with immunofluorescence criteria for enumeration. In a pilot study, we demonstrate significantly higher CTC counts in patients with late-stage prostate cancer (n=13) compared to healthy controls (n=8), with a patient-level false positive rate of 1 cell/mL. Notably, nearly two-thirds of identified CTCs were EpCAM-negative but PSMA positive (a prostate specific epithelial marker), suggesting that traditional use of EpCAM as an epithelial marker for CTCs may lead to false negatives. These findings highlight the potential of DHM for applications including but not limited to screening, diagnostics, and precision oncology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, an interdisciplinary field merging nanotechnology and photonics, has enabled transformative advancements across diverse sectors including green energy, biomedicine, and optical computing. This review comprehensively examines recent progress in nanophotonic principles and applications, highlighting key innovations in material design, device engineering, and system integration. In renewable energy, nanophotonic allows light-trapping nanostructures and spectral control in perovskite solar cells, concentrating solar power, and thermophotovoltaics. That have significantly enhanced solar conversion efficiencies, approaching theoretical limits. For biosensing, nanophotonic platforms achieve unprecedented sensitivity in detecting biomolecules, pathogens, and pollutants, enabling real-time diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Medical applications leverage tailored light-matter interactions for precision photothermal therapy, image-guided surgery, and early disease detection. Furthermore, nanophotonics underpins next-generation optical neural networks and neuromorphic computing, offering ultra-fast, energy-efficient alternatives to von Neumann architectures. Despite rapid growth, challenges in scalability, fabrication costs, and material stability persist. Future advancements will rely on novel materials, AI-driven design optimization, and multidisciplinary approaches to enable scalable, low-cost deployment. This review summarizes recent progress and highlights future trends, including novel material systems, multidisciplinary approaches, and enhanced computational capabilities, to pave the way for transformative applications in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Isotropic STED Nanoscopy using a Single Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) imaging requires an isotropic point spread function (PSF). However, the inherent missing aperture of a single objective lens results in an elongated, cigar-like PSF, which has rendered isotropic resolution in fluorescence microscopy seemingly insurmountable without a 4{\pi} configuration for decades. To address this long-standing challenge, we introduce ISO-STED (Isotropic Single-Objective STED) Nanoscopy, a novel approach that employs a single objective lens and a single depletion beam. By utilizing a hollow depletion focus, ISO-STED achieves an isotropic PSF without relying on a 4{\pi} configuration. This innovative design enables uniform fluorescence suppression in all directions, thereby yielding an isotropic 3D resolution of approximately 70 nm. Our work not only demonstrates the potential of ISO-STED Nanoscopy to provide a compact and versatile solution for isotropic 3D imaging in complex specimens but also paves the way for more accessible and practical applications in various research fields, including biomedical research and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Emission Spectroscopy of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-optical control of Multiple Light Degrees of Freedom through Mode-mixing in a Graphene Nanoribbon Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of optical technologies necessitates advanced solutions for selective and dynamic manipulation of light's degrees of freedom, including amplitude, phase, polarization, wavelength, and angular momentum. Metamaterials can offer such control through the interplay between the intrinsic material and geometrical properties of nanostructures or extrinsically through excitation and detection symmetry breaking, leading to customizable performance. However, achieving dynamic control over multiple light degrees of freedom remains a challenge. To address existing limitations, we present a novel dual-stack metamaterial design capable of broadband ultrafast control over amplitude, phase, polarization, spin angular momentum, and handedness of light mediated by two independently controlled nanoribbon layers that enable flexible and selective mode-mixing in both reflection and transmission. Through a combination of a thermal response model and Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, we investigate graphene as a suitable material for the metamaterial design, leveraging the intrinsic optical properties of graphene and its tunable conductivity through electrostatic gating and ultrafast optical excitation, achieving selective control over multiple light degrees of freedom at ultrafast timescales. This selective ultrafast mode-mixing significantly advances the capabilities of high-speed photonic systems, paving the way for compact, high data-rate optical technologies essential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Anti-Interference Diffractive Deep Neural Networks for Multi-Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) are emerging as a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm for object recognition, offering unprecedented advantages in light-speed computation, ultra-low power consumption, and inherent parallelism. However, most of ONNs are only capable of performing simple object classification tasks. These tasks are typically constrained to single-object scenarios, which limits their practical applications in multi-object recognition tasks. Here, we propose an anti-interference diffractive deep neural network (AI D2NN) that can accurately and robustly recognize targets in multi-object scenarios, including intra-class, inter-class, and dynamic interference. By employing different deep-learning-based training strategies for targets and interference, two transmissive diffractive layers form a physical network that maps the spatial information of targets all-optically into the power spectrum of the output light, while dispersing all interference as background noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in classifying unknown handwritten digits under dynamic scenarios involving 40 categories of interference, achieving a simulated blind testing accuracy of 87.4% using terahertz waves. The presented framework can be physically scaled to operate at any electromagnetic wavelength by simply scaling the diffractive features in proportion to the wavelength range of interest. This work can greatly advance the practical application of ONNs in target recognition and pave the way for the development of real-time, high-throughput, low-power all-optical computing systems, which are expected to be applied to autonomous driving perception, precision medical diagnosis, and intelligent security monitoring.</description>

      <title>Tuning the probability detection of OAM entangled photons in Helical Ince-Gauss modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of the two-photon Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) entangled state, generated by a type-I Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) process, when decomposed in terms of the Helical Ince-Gauss (HIG) modes basis. By exploiting the unique characteristics of this modal basis we show how the probability detection of the photon-pair can be tuned with the ellipticity parameter of the modes. We also show that, on the HIG basis the SPDC state has the contribution of two different symmetric Bell states, and it is possible to maximize the probability of each HIG symmetric Bell state separately, also by tuning the elipticity of the projected basis. The observed properties are confirmed experimentally by implementing measurements of the HIG modal joint probability of the SPDC two-photon state and Bell-type inequality violation experiments.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and Topology of Exceptional Rings in Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Planar Optical Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems hosting exceptional points (EPs) exhibit enhanced sensitivity and unconventional mode dynamics. Going beyond isolated EPs, here we report on the existence of exceptional rings (ERs) in planar optical resonators with specific form of circular dichroism and TE-TM splitting. Such exceptional rings possess intriguing topologies as discussed earlier for condensed matter systems, but they remain virtually unexplored in presence of nonlinearity, for which our photonic platform is ideal. We find that when Kerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits into two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of third-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a rigorous analysis of spectral topology and report enhanced and adjustable perturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are specific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian spectral topology and nonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to a broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal framework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Terahertz field-induced metastable magnetization near criticality in FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the N\'eel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate the quantum frequency conversion of entangled photons driven by a classically non-separable laser beam. We show that the frequency conversion dynamics is described by a quantum channel that stems from the classical drive field through the channel-state duality - the quantum channel is dual to the classical coherence matrix of the drive field. This implies that the evolution of entanglement in the conversion process is bound by the classical non-separability of the drive field, a result that we confirm experimentally. Furthermore, we show that the conversion dynamics can be understood as a swapping operation between classical non-separability and entanglement, unveiling a physical connection between two fundamentally different concepts.</description>

      <title>Rotational coherences in O$_2^+$ following strong-field ionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the wave packet that remains bound in the ground and excited cationic states of oxygen after strong-field ionization by an intense 800-nm pulse. Much weaker probe pulses (800 or 264 nm) are used to dissociate these still-bound cations. The momentum distribution of O$^+$ is measured as a function of pump-probe delay and Fourier-transformed to obtain kinetic-energy-dependent and rotational-state-resolved quantum beat spectra. The sub-cm$^{-1}$ resolution of the Fourier transform allows unambiguous identification of the electronic, vibrational, and rotational states populated by the pump and then dissociated by the probe. Although strong-field ionization is expected to populate the lower-lying $X^2\Pi_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ states more effectively than the $b^4\Sigma^{-}_g$ state, a wave packet in the $X^2\Pi_g$ state is seen only with the 264-nm probe and only weak signatures of the $a^4\Pi_u$ states are found with either probe. The experiment confirms the role of the resonant coupling between the $b^4\Sigma^{-}_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ states by the 800 nm pulses [Xue \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A 97, 043409 (2018)] and reveals the importance of rovibrational excitation in determining the momentum distribution of the O$^+$ fragments. The strong $X^2\Pi_g$ state contribution observed with the 264-nm probe also shows the importance of resonant coupling in the probe pulse. The sub-cm$^{-1}$ resolution also resolves spin-orbit splitting in both the $X^2\Pi_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ state wave packets.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dark-Field Imaging in Full-Field Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark-field signal uncovers details beyond conventional X-ray attenuation contrast, which is especially valuable for material sciences. In particular, dark-field techniques are able to reveal structures beyond the spatial resolution of a setup. However, its implementation is yet limited to the micrometer regime. Therefore, we propose a technique to extend full-field transmission X-ray microscopy by the dark-field signal. The proposed method is based on a well-defined illumination of a beam-shaping condenser, which allows to block the bright-field by motorized apertures in the back focal plane of the objective's lens. This method offers a simple implementation and enables rapid modality changes while maintaining short scan times, making dark-field imaging widely available at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature mid-infrared detection using metasurface-absorber-integrated phononic crystal oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) detectors find extensive applications in chemical sensing, spectroscopy, communications, biomedical diagnosis and space explorations. Alternative to semiconductor MIR photodiodes and bolometers, mechanical-resonator-based MIR detectors show advantages in higher sensitivity and lower noise at room temperature, especially towards longer wavelength infrared. Here, we demonstrate uncooled room-temperature MIR detectors based on lithium niobate surface acoustic wave phononic crystal (PnC) resonators integrated with wavelength-and-polarization-selective metasurface absorber arrays. The detection is based on the resonant frequency shift induced by the local temperature change due to MIR absorptions. The PnC resonator is configured in an oscillating mode, enabling active readout and low frequency noise. Compared with detectors based on tethered thin-film mechanical resonators, our non-suspended, fully supported PnC resonators offer lower noise, faster thermal response, and robustness in both fabrication and practical applications. Our 1-GHz oscillator-based MIR detector shows a relative frequency deviation of $5.24 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at an integration time of 50 ${\mu}$s, leading to an incident noise equivalent power of 197 pW/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ when input 6-${\mu}$m MIR light is modulated at 1.8 kHz, and a large dynamic range of 107 in incident MIR power. Our device architecture is compatible with the scalable manufacturing process and can be readily extended to a broader spectral range by tailoring the absorbing wavelengths of metasurface absorbers.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that simulates the molecular environment, excluding the field generated by the molecule or molecules themselves. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations and leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>

      <title>High-quality metalens enables minimally invasive CFB endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metalenses, owing to their ultra-thin planar structures, present a promising solution for reducing endoscopic invasiveness. However, achieving high-quality imaging with minimal invasiveness (short focal length of metalens) remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a deep learning assisted metalens with a 1mm focal length tailored for coherent fiber bundle, constituting the least invasive metalens-CFB system reported to date. To overcome the increased chromatic dispersion and aberrations associated with high NA metalens, we compensate for lateral etching at the base of the nanopillars by adjusting the thickness of a sacrificial hard mask. This approach enables the fabrication of nanopillars with small cross sections and high aspect ratios, featuring nearly vertical sidewalls (~90{\deg}), thereby enhancing the phase accuracy of the metalens. Experimental validation using the metalens-CFB system demonstrates that the metalens achieves an expanded field of view of 48.3{\deg} and a depth of field exceeding 125 mm. This work establishes a new paradigm for ultra-minimally invasive endoscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bounds on Entropy and Ergotropy via Statistical Effective Temperature in Classical Polarization and Quantum Thermal States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a unified definition of the statistical effective temperature (SET) for finite-dimensional classical and quantum systems using dimension-dependent indices of purity derived from the eigenvalue spectrum. This spectral approach bypasses the need for Hamiltonians or energy gaps and remains applicable to both quantum density matrices and classical polarization coherency matrices. The SET framework naturally describes the divergence of inverse temperature near pure, non-degenerate states, consistent with the third law. Using entropy-SET diagrams, we explore spectral bounds in two-, three-, and four-level systems, which reveal physically realizable entropy regions, rank-dependent constraints, and cusp-like features. A Hamiltonian-free parametric spectrum ansatz provides a universal reference curve within these bounds. Furthermore, we derive spectral bounds on ergotropy as a function of entropy and SET, which quantify the maximum extractable work under passive constraints and introduce the notion of structured-states, engineered spectral configurations that saturate these bounds. Our analysis shows that SET serves as a thermodynamically meaningful and operationally relevant quantity for bounding entropy and ergotropy in both classical polarization systems and quantum thermal states.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</description>
