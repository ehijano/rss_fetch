      <title>A Structural Analysis of the User Behavior Dynamics for Environmentally Sustainable ICT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sector of information and communication technology (ICT) can contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris agreement and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the introduction of sustainability strategies. For environmental sustainability, such strategies should contain efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency measures. To propose such, a structural analysis of ICT is undertaken in this manuscript. Thereby, key mechanisms and dynamics behind the usage of ICT and the corresponding energy and resource use are analyzed by describing ICT as a complex system. The system contains data centers, communication networks, smartphone hardware, apps, and the behavior of the users as sub-systems, between which various Morinian interactions are present. Energy and non-energy resources can be seen as inputs of the system, while e-waste is an output. Based on the system description, we propose multiple measures for efficiency, sufficiency and consistency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Approach to Avoiding Weak Keys in the BIKE Cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) is a code-based cryptosystem being considered in Round 4 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process. It is based on quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes paired with an iterative decoder. While (low-density) parity-check codes have been demonstrated to perform well in practice, their capabilities are governed by the code's graphical representation and the choice of decoder rather than the traditional code parameters making it a challenge to determine the decoder failure rate (DFR). Moreover, decoding failures have been demonstrated to lead to attacks that recover the BIKE private key. In this paper, we consider structures leading to decoding failure for the iterative decoder used in BIKE. We demonstrate a strong relationship between weak keys and 4-cycles in the associated Tanner graph and harness it to describe the distance profile directly from the defining codeword. By exploiting the cycle structure of the graphs, we provide a new filter for the allowable keys in BIKE. These results apply to more general parity-check codes as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autocorrelation of a sequence is a useful criterion, among all, of resistance to cryptographic attacks. The behavior of the autocorrelations of random Boolean functions (studied by Florian Caullery, Eric F\'erard and Fran\c{c}ois Rodier [4]) shows that they are concentrated around a point. We show that the same is true for the evaluation of the periodic autocorrelations of random binary sequences.</description>

      <title>Multi-Block UAMP Detection for AFDM under Fractional Delay-Doppler Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is considered as a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems due to its satisfactory performance in high-mobility scenarios. By adjusting AFDM parameters to match the multi-path delay and Doppler shift, AFDM can achieve two-dimensional time-frequency diversity gain. However, under fractional delay-Doppler channels, AFDM encounters energy dispersion in the affine domain, which poses significant challenges for signal detection. This paper first investigates the AFDM system model under fractional delay-Doppler channels. To address the energy dispersion in the affine domain, a unitary transformation based approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm performs unitary transformations and message passing in the time domain to avoid the energy dispersion issue. Additionally, we implemented block-wise processing to reduce computational complexity. Finally, the empirical extrinsic information transfer (E-EXIT) chart is used to evaluate iterative detection performance. Simulation results show that UAMP significantly outperforms GAMP under fractional delay-Doppler conditions.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting-Based Channel Prediction on Real-World Distributed Massive MIMO CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed massive MIMO is considered a key advancement for improving the performance of next-generation wireless telecommunication systems. However, its efficacy in scenarios involving user mobility is limited due to channel aging. To address this challenge, channel prediction techniques are investigated to forecast future channel state information (CSI) based on previous estimates. We propose a new channel prediction method based on channel charting, a self-supervised learning technique that reconstructs a physically meaningful latent representation of the radio environment using similarity relationships between CSI samples. The concept of inertia within a channel chart allows for predictive radio resource management tasks through the latent space. We demonstrate that channel charting can be used to predict future CSI by exploiting spatial relationships between known estimates that are embedded in the channel chart. Our method is validated on a real-world distributed massive MIMO dataset, and compared to a Wiener predictor and the outdated CSI in terms of achievable sum rate.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Version Innovation Age for Monitoring Markovian Source in Energy-Harvesting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real-time remote tracking of a two-state Markov process by an energy harvesting source. The source decides whether to transmit over an unreliable channel based on the state. We formulate this scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP) to determine the optimal transmission policy that minimizes the average Version Innovation Age (VIA) as a performance metric. We demonstrate that the optimal transmission policy is threshold-based, determined by the battery level, source state, and VIA value. We numerically verify the analytical structure of the optimal policy and compare the performance of our proposed policy against two baseline policies across various system parameters, establishing the superior performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Identification over Affine Poisson Channels: Applications to Molecular Mixture Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification capacity has been established as a relevant performance metric for various goal-/task-oriented applications, where the receiver may be interested in only a particular message that represents an event or a task. For example, in olfactory molecular communications (MCs), odors or pheromones, which are often a mixture of various molecule types, may signal nearby danger, food, or a mate. In this paper, we examine the identification capacity with deterministic encoder for the discrete-time affine Poisson channel (DTAPC) which can be used to model MC systems with molecule counting receivers. We establish lower and upper bounds on the identification capacity in terms of features of affinity matrix between the released molecules and receptors at the receiver. As a key finding, we show that even when the number of receptor types scales sub-linearly in $N,$ the number of reliably identifiable mixtures can grow super-exponentially with the rank of the affinity matrix, $T,$ i.e., $\sim 2^{(T \log T)R},$ where $R$ denotes the coding rate. We further drive lower and upper bounds on $R,$ and show that the proposed capacity theorem includes several known results in the literature as its special cases.</description>

      <title>Null models for comparing information decomposition across complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature of information theory is its universality, as it can be applied to study a broad variety of complex systems. However, many information-theoretic measures can vary significantly even across systems with similar properties, making normalisation techniques essential for allowing meaningful comparisons across datasets. Inspired by the framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID), here we introduce Null Models for Information Theory (NuMIT), a null model-based non-linear normalisation procedure which improves upon standard entropy-based normalisation approaches and overcomes their limitations. We provide practical implementations of the technique for systems with different statistics, and showcase the method on synthetic models and on human neuroimaging data. Our results demonstrate that NuMIT provides a robust and reliable tool to characterise complex systems of interest, allowing cross-dataset comparisons and providing a meaningful significance test for PID analyses.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communications for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO: A Beamspace Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is regarded as one of the key techniques to enhance the performance of future wireless communications. Different from regular MIMO, the XL-MIMO shifts part of the communication region from the far field to the near field, where the spherical-wave channel model cannot be accurately approximated by the commonly-adopted planar-wave channel model. As a result, the well-explored far-field beamspace is unsuitable for near-field communications, thereby requiring the exploration of specialized near-field beamspace. In this article, we investigate the near-field communications for XL-MIMO from the perspective of beamspace. Given the spherical wavefront characteristics of the near-field channels, we first map the antenna space to the near-field beamspace with the fractional Fourier transform. Then, we divide the near-field beamspace into three parts, including high mainlobe, low mainlobe, and sidelobe, and provide a comprehensive analysis of these components. Based on the analysis, we demonstrate the advantages of the near-field beamspace over the existing methods. Finally, we point out several applications of the near-field beamspace and highlight some potential directions for future study in the near-field beamspace.</description>

      <title>Discovering the critical number of respondents to validate an item in a questionnaire: The Binomial Cut-level Content Validity proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question that drives this research is: "How to discover the number of respondents that are necessary to validate items of a questionnaire as actually essential to reach the questionnaire's proposal?" Among the efforts in this subject, \cite{Lawshe1975, Wilson2012, Ayre_CVR_2014} approached this issue by proposing and refining the Content Validation Ratio (CVR) that looks to identify items that are actually essentials. Despite their contribution, these studies do not check if an item validated as "essential" should be also validated as "not essential" by the same sample, which should be a paradox. Another issue is the assignment a probability equal a 50\% to a item be randomly checked by a respondent as essential, despite an evaluator has three options to choose. Our proposal faces these issues, making it possible to verify if a paradoxical situation occurs, and being more precise in recommending whether an item should either be retained or discarded from a questionnaire.</description>

      <title>Interpretability as Compression: Reconsidering SAE Explanations of Neural Activations with MDL-SAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a useful tool for interpreting the internal representations of neural networks. However, naively optimising SAEs for reconstruction loss and sparsity results in a preference for SAEs that are extremely wide and sparse. We present an information-theoretic framework for interpreting SAEs as lossy compression algorithms for communicating explanations of neural activations. We appeal to the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle to motivate explanations of activations which are both accurate and concise. We further argue that interpretable SAEs require an additional property, "independent additivity": features should be able to be understood separately. We demonstrate an example of applying our MDL-inspired framework by training SAEs on MNIST handwritten digits and find that SAE features representing significant line segments are optimal, as opposed to SAEs with features for memorised digits from the dataset or small digit fragments. We argue that using MDL rather than sparsity may avoid potential pitfalls with naively maximising sparsity such as undesirable feature splitting and that this framework naturally suggests new hierarchical SAE architectures which provide more concise explanations.</description>

      <title>Communication-Control Codesign for Large-Scale Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) are essential to Industry 4.0, enabling flexible control in applications, such as drone swarms and autonomous robots. The interdependence between communication and control requires integrated design, but traditional methods treat them separately, leading to inefficiencies. Current codesign approaches often rely on simplified models, focusing on single-loop or independent multi-loop systems. However, large-scale WNCSs face unique challenges, including coupled control loops, time-correlated wireless channels, trade-offs between sensing and control transmissions, and significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a practical WNCS model that captures correlated dynamics among multiple control loops with spatially distributed sensors and actuators sharing limited wireless resources over multi-state Markov block-fading channels. We formulate the codesign problem as a sequential decision-making task that jointly optimizes scheduling and control inputs across estimation, control, and communication domains. To solve this problem, we develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that efficiently handles the hybrid action space, captures communication-control correlations, and ensures robust training despite sparse cross-domain variables and floating control inputs. Extensive simulations show that the proposed DRL approach outperforms benchmarks and solves the large-scale WNCS codesign problem, providing a scalable solution for industrial automation.</description>

      <title>On the Training Convergence of Transformers for In-Context Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While transformers have demonstrated impressive capacities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism enabling transformers to perform ICL is still in its infant stage. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the Bayes-optimal classifier. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network based Active and Passive Beamforming for Distributed STAR-RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint active and passive beamforming design for distributed simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user (MU)- mutiple input single output (MISO) systems, where the energy splitting (ES) mode is considered for the STAR-RIS. We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</description>

      <title>OFDM Achieves the Lowest Ranging Sidelobe Under Random ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.</description>

      <title>Alternating Maximization Algorithm for Mismatch Capacity with Oblivious Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable communication over a discrete memoryless channel with the help of a relay has aroused interest due to its widespread applications in practical scenarios. By considering the system with a mismatched decoder, previous works have provided optimization models to evaluate the mismatch capacity in these scenarios. The proposed models, however, are difficult due to the complicated structure of the mismatched decoding problem with the information flows in hops given by the relay. Existing methods, such as the grid search, become impractical as they involve finding all roots of a nonlinear system, with the growing size of the alphabet. To address this problem, we reformulate the max-min optimization model as a consistent maximization form, by considering the dual form of the inner minimization problem and the Lagrangian with a fixed multiplier. Based on the proposed formulation, an alternating maximization framework is designed, which provides the closed-form solution with simple iterations in each step by introducing a suitable variable transformation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the simulations over practical scenarios, including Quaternary and Gaussian channels. Moreover, the simulation results of the transitional probability also shed light on the promising application attribute to the quantizer design in the relay node.</description>

      <title>Limit Distribution Theory for Quantum Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of quantum relative entropy and its R\'{e}nyi generalizations is a fundamental statistical task in quantum information theory, physics, and beyond. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature along with their computational complexities explored, a limit distribution theory which characterizes the asymptotic fluctuations of the estimation error is still premature. As our main contribution, we characterize these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator version of Taylor's theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed. As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative entropy based on Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that the resulting asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance characterized in terms of the Pauli operators and states. We utilize the knowledge of the aforementioned limit distribution to obtain asymptotic performance guarantees for a multi-hypothesis testing problem.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Based Vulnerabilities in Lee Metric Post-Quantum Cryptosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography has gained attention due to the need for secure cryptographic systems in the face of quantum computing. Code-based and lattice-based cryptography are two prominent approaches, both heavily studied within the NIST standardization project. Code-based cryptography -- most prominently exemplified by the McEliece cryptosystem -- is based on the hardness of decoding random linear error-correcting codes. Despite the McEliece cryptosystem having been unbroken for several decades, it suffers from large key sizes, which has led to exploring variants using metrics than the Hamming metric, such as the Lee metric. This alternative metric may allow for smaller key sizes, but requires further analysis for potential vulnerabilities to lattice-based attack techniques. In this paper, we consider a generic Lee metric based McEliece type cryptosystem and evaluate its security against lattice-based attacks.</description>
