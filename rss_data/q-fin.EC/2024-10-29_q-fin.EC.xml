      <title>New evaluation tool for predicting disability pension risk among Finnish public sector employees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using unique research data, we investigate disability retirement risk under the statutory public sector pension scheme in Finland. The statistical analysis yields two indicators: risk for upcoming permanent disability pension and critical duration of sickness absence days for public sector occupations. Statistical analysis is based on logistic regression model where the outcome is the disability pension, using sickness benefit spells and other individual background information as covariates. The results underline the importance of minimizing the sickness spells and their duration to the risk and reveal differences in risk across occupations. We conclude that the proposed risk model is a promising tool which can help employers and the pension industry in preventing permanent disability.</description>

      <title>Urban Mobility: AI, ODE-Based Modeling, and Scenario Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urbanization and technological advancements are reshaping the future of urban mobility, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This paper combines foresight and scenario planning with mathematical modeling using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven technologies can transform transportation systems. By simulating ODE-based models in Python, we quantify the impact of AI innovations, such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic management, on reducing traffic congestion under different regulatory conditions.
  Our ODE models capture the dynamic relationship between AI adoption rates and traffic congestion, providing quantitative insights into how future scenarios might unfold. By incorporating industry collaborations and case studies, we offer strategic guidance for businesses and policymakers navigating this evolving landscape. This study contributes to understanding how foresight, scenario planning, and ODE modeling can inform strategies for creating more efficient, sustainable, and livable cities through AI adoption.</description>

      <title>Strategic Control of Facial Expressions by the Fed Chair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates whether the Federal Reserve Chair strategically controls facial expressions during FOMC press conferences and how these nonverbal cues affect financial markets. I use facial recognition technology on videos of press conferences from April 2011 to December 2020 to quantify changes in the Chair's nonverbal signals. Results show that facial expressions serve as a separate public signal, distinct from verbal content. Using deepfakes, I find that the same facial expressions expressed by different Fed Chairs are interpreted differentially. As their tenure increases, negative expressions become more frequent, eliciting adverse market reactions. Furthermore, the markets interpretation of these expressions evolves over time, suggesting that investors process facial cues with dual-processing finite-state Markov memory. In line with the Fed's goals of transparency and non-volatility, I find that Fed Chairs do not strategically control their expressions.</description>

      <title>Modelling of Economic Implications of Bias in AI-Powered Health Emergency Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework assessing the economic implications of bias in AI-powered emergency response systems. Integrating health economics, welfare economics, and artificial intelligence, we analyze how algorithmic bias affects resource allocation, health outcomes, and social welfare. By incorporating a bias function into health production and social welfare models, we quantify its impact on demographic groups, showing that bias leads to suboptimal resource distribution, increased costs, and welfare losses. The framework highlights efficiency-equity trade-offs and provides economic interpretations. We propose mitigation strategies, including fairness-constrained optimization, algorithmic adjustments, and policy interventions. Our findings offer insights for policymakers, emergency service providers, and technology developers, emphasizing the need for AI systems that are efficient and equitable. By addressing the economic consequences of biased AI, this study contributes to policies and technologies promoting fairness, efficiency, and social welfare in emergency response services.</description>

      <title>Democratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.</description>

      <title>Tests of thermal macroeconomic theory on simulated micro-economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test predictions of a new theory of macroeconomics, called "thermal macroeconomics." The theory aims to apply the mathematical structure of classical thermodynamics, including analogues of temperature and entropy, to predict aspects of the aggregate behaviour of populations of economic agents without analyzing their detailed interactions. We test the theory by comparing its predictions with the behaviour of a variety of simulated micro-economies in which goods and money can be exchanged between agents, confirming the predictions of the theory. The paper serves also to illustrate and make more tangible the predictions of thermal macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Baby Blues: The Child Penalty in Mental Health in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mental health penalty for women after childbirth in Switzerland. Leveraging insurance data, we employ a staggered difference-in-difference research design. The findings reveal a substantial mental health penalty for women following the birth of their first child. Approximately four years after childbirth, there is a one percentage point (p.p.) increase in antidepressant prescriptions, representing a 50% increase compared to pre-birth levels. This increase rises to 1.7 p.p. (a 70% increase) six years postpartum. The mental health penalty is likely not only a direct consequence of giving birth but also a consequence of the changed life circumstances and time constraints that accompany it, as the penalty is rising over time and is higher for women who are employed before childbirth.</description>

      <title>Knowledge and Freedom: Evidence on the Relationship Between Information and Paternalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When is autonomy granted to a decision-maker based on their knowledge, and if no autonomy is granted, what form will the intervention take? A parsimonious theory shows how policymakers can exploit decision-maker mistakes and use them as a justification for intervention. In two experiments, policymakers ("Choice Architects") can intervene in a choice faced by a decision-maker. We vary the amount of knowledge decision-makers possess about the choice. Full decision-maker knowledge causes more than a 60% reduction in intervention rates. Beliefs have a small, robust correlation with interventions on the intensive margin. Choice Architects disproportionately prefer to have decision-makers make informed decisions. Interveners are less likely to provide information. As theory predicts, the same applies to Choice Architects who believe that decision-maker mistakes align with their own preference. When Choice Architects are informed about the decision-maker's preference, this information is used to determine the imposed option. However, Choice Architects employ their own preference to a similar extent. A riskless option is causally more likely to be imposed, being correlated with but conceptually distinct from Choice Architects' own preference. This is a qualification to what has been termed "projective paternalism."</description>

      <title>Economic Integration of Africa in the 21st Century: Complex Network and Panel Regression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global and regional integration has grown significantly in recent decades, boosting intra-African trade and positively impacting national economies through trade diversification and sustainable development. However, existing measures of economic integration often fail to capture the complex interactions among trading partners. This study addresses this gap by using complex network analysis and dynamic panel regression techniques to identify factors driving economic integration in Africa, based on data from 2002 to 2019. The results show that economic development, institutional quality, regional trade agreements, human capital, FDI, and infrastructure positively influence a country's position in the African trade network. Conversely, trade costs, the global financial crisis, and regional overlapping memberships negatively affect network based integration. Our findings suggest that enhancing a country's connectivity in the African trade network involves identifying key economic and institutional factors of trade partners and strategically focusing on continent-wide agreements rather than just regional ones to boost economic growth.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adopt Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT, a large language model providing natural language responses, has become a powerful tool integrated into many people's daily routines. Despite its capabilities, the benefits it provides may not be equally distributed among individuals-a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. Building upon prior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI adoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous abilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility divide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility gains per usage from ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian learning model that incorporates demographic heterogeneities in both the utility and signal functions. Leveraging a six-month clickstream dataset, we estimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across various demographic attributes. Surprisingly, lowereducated and non-white individuals derive higher utility gains from ChatGPT but learn about its utility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those with an IT background not only derive higher utility per use from ChatGPT but also learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon termed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not to use the tool, and consequently lack new experiences to update their perceptions, leading to continued underutilization. We further demonstrate that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability of falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption outcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can alleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complex dynamics of high-dimensional, contingent, and strongly nonlinear economic data, often shaped by multiplicative processes, poses significant challenges for traditional regression methods as such methods offer limited capacity to capture the structural changes they feature. To address this, we propose leveraging the potential of knowledge graph embeddings for economic trade data, in particular, to predict international trade relationships. We implement KonecoKG, a knowledge graph representation of economic trade data with multidimensional relationships using SDM-RDFizer, and transform the relationships into a knowledge graph embedding using AmpliGraph.</description>

      <title>Dual-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing and Replenishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing and replenishment problems under inconsistent decision frequencies. Different from the traditional demand assumption, the discreteness of demand and the parameter within the Poisson distribution as a function of price introduce complexity into analyzing the problem property. We demonstrate the concavity of the single-period profit function with respect to product price and inventory within their respective domains. The demand model is enhanced by integrating a decision tree-based machine learning approach, trained on comprehensive market data. Employing a two-timescale stochastic approximation scheme, we address the discrepancies in decision frequencies between pricing and replenishment, ensuring convergence to local optimum. We further refine our methodology by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and propose a fast-slow dual-agent DRL algorithm. In this approach, two agents handle pricing and inventory and are updated on different scales. Numerical results from both single and multiple products scenarios validate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Can Digital Aid Deliver During Humanitarian Crises?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can digital payments systems help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries' limited tech literacy, 99.75\% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme's global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital platform technologies can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournaments are frequently used incentive mechanisms to enhance performance. In this paper, we use field data and show that skill disparities among contestants asymmetrically affect the performance of contestants. Skill disparities have detrimental effects on the performance of the lower-ability contestant but positive effects on the performance of the higher-ability contestant. We discuss the potential of different behavioral approaches to explain our findings and discuss the implications of our results for the optimal design of contests. Beyond that, our study reveals two important empirical results: (a) affirmative action-type policies may help to mitigate the adverse effects on lower-ability contestants, and (b) the skill level of potential future contestants in subsequent tournament stages can detrimentally influence the performance of higher-ability contestants but does not affect the lower-ability contestant.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

Abstract: Individual participants in human society collectively exhibit aggregation behavior. In this study, we present a simple microscopic model of labor force migration based on the active Brownian particles framework. In particular, agent-based simulations show that the model produces clusters of agents from a random initial distribution. Furthermore, two empirical regularities called Zipf's and Okun's laws were observed. To reveal the mechanism underlying the reproduced aggregation phenomena, we use our microscopic model to derive an extended Keller--Segel system, which is a classic model describing the aggregation behavior of biological organisms called taxis. The obtained macroscopic system indicates that the concentration of the workforce in the real world can be explained through a new type of taxis central to human behavior, highlighting the relevance of urbanization to blow-up phenomena in the derived PDE system. We then characterize the transition between the aggregation and diffusion regimes both analytically and computationally. The predicted long-term dynamics of urbanization -- originating in the asymmetric natures of employed and unemployed agents -- are compared with global empirical data, particularly in the realms of labor statistics and urban indicators.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.</description>
