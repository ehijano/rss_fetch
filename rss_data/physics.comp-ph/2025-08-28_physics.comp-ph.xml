      <title>Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organized turbulence represents a way for structuring in nature to arise through sheer complexity rather than through linear instability theory. Simulating ensembles of oscillators that undergo phase synchronization through a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field, we present the spectral characteristics of spontaneous, self-organized structures of locally coupled oscillators. We demonstrate that the spectral density of emergent structures can exhibit universal scaling laws, in line with expectations from nature, indicating that observed statistical outcomes of complex physical interactions can be achieved through a more general principle of self-organization. We suggest that spontaneously generated structures may provide nuance to the reigning reductionist explanations for the observed structure in coupled systems of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Machine learning topological defect formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>Enhanced premelting at the ice-rubber interface using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.</description>

      <title>Tsunami modeling with dynamic seafloors: a high-order solver validated with shallow water benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor (bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC) methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild (linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or ''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances). Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data. Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for) incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Re4: Scientific Computing Agent with Rewriting, Resolution, Review and Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent, incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific computing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Implementation of McMurchie-Davidson algorithm for Gaussian AO integrals suited for SIMD processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson evaluation scheme for 1- and 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals designed for processors with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction sets. Like in our recent MD implementation for graphical processing units (GPUs) [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 244109 (2024)], variable-sized batches of shellsets of integrals are evaluated at a time. By optimizing for the floating point instruction throughput rather than minimizing the number of operations, this approach achieves up to 50% of the theoretical hardware peak FP64 performance for many common SIMD-equipped platforms (AVX2, AVX512, NEON), which translates to speedups of up to 30 over the state-of-the-art one-shellset-at-a-time implementation of Obara-Saika-type schemes in Libint for a variety of primitive and contracted integrals. As with our previous work, we rely on the standard C++ programming language -- such as the std::simd standard library feature to be included in the 2026 ISO C++ standard -- without any explicit code generation to keep the code base small and portable. The implementation is part of the open source LibintX library freely available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/libintx.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>
