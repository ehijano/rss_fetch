      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal forces violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, much less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive the fundamental field theory of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from microscopic dynamics, leading to a generic framework termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this intrinsic nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between force nonreciprocity and competition. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Orbits, spirals, and trapped states: Dynamics of a phoretic Janus particle in a radial concentration gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding goal in colloidal active matter is to understand how gradients in fuel concentration influence the motion of phoretic Janus particles. Here, we present a theoretical description of the motion of a spherical phoretic Janus particle in the presence of a radial gradient of the chemical solute driving self-propulsion. Radial gradients are a geometry relevant to many scenarios in active matter systems and naturally arise due to the presence of a point source or sink of fuel. We derive an analytical solution for the Janus particle's velocity and quantify the influence of the radial concentration gradient on the particle's trajectory. Compared to a phoretic Janus particle in a linear gradient in fuel concentration, we uncover a much richer set of dynamical behaviors, including circular orbits and trapped stationary states. We identify the ratio of the phoretic mobilities between the two domains of the Janus particle as a central quantity in tuning their dynamics. Our results provide a path for developing novel protocols for tuning the dynamics of phoretic Janus particles and mixing fluid at the microscale. In addition, this work suggests a method for quantifying the surface properties of phoretic Janus particles, which have proven challenging to probe experimentally.</description>

      <title>Supercoiled ring polymers under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply monomer-resolved computer simulations of supercoiled ring polymers under shear, taking full account of the hydrodynamic interactions, accompanied, in parallel, by simulations in which these are switched off. The combination of bending and torsional rigidities inherent in these polymers, in conjunction with hydrodynamics, has a profound impact on their flow properties. In contrast to their flexible counterparts, which dramatcially deform and inflate under shear [Liebetreu et al., Commun. Mater. 1, 4 (2020)], supercoiled rings undergo only weak changes in their overall shape and they display both a reduced propensity to tumbling (at fixed Weissenberg number) and a much stronger orientational resistance with respect to their flexible counterparts. In the presence of hydrodynamic interactions, the coupling of the polymer to solvent flow is capable of bringing about a topological transformation of writhe to twist at strong shear upon conservation of the overall linking number.</description>

      <title>Universal Displacements in Anisotropic Linear Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal displacements are those displacements that can be maintained for any member of a specific class of linear elastic materials in the absence of body forces, solely by applying boundary tractions. For linear hyperelastic (Green elastic) solids, it is known that the space of universal displacements explicitly depends on the symmetry group of the material, and moreover, the larger the symmetry group the larger the set of universal displacements. Linear Cauchy elastic solids, which include linear hyperelastic solids as a special case, do not necessarily have an underlying energy function. Consequently, their elastic constants do not possess the major symmetries. In this paper, we characterize the universal displacements of anisotropic linear Cauchy elasticity. We prove the unexpected result that for each symmetry class, the set of universal displacements of linear Cauchy elasticity is identical to that of linear hyperelasticity.</description>

      <title>Progressive polymer deformation induced by polar activity and the influence of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar activity is shown here to induce a progressive local deformation of linear polymer chains, making a clear distinction between head and tail, while the overall chain conformation gets more compact. This breakdown of self-similarity, provoked by the accumulated tension on the polymer backbone induced by the activity, is shown to occur both in the absence and presence of inertia, although it is stronger in the latter case. Other properties like the relaxation time and diffusion are also largely influenced by the presence of a polar activity.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion is temperature independent on active membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular transport maintains cellular structures and functions. For example, lipid and protein diffusion sculpts the dynamic shapes and structures on the cell membrane that perform essential cellular functions, such as cell signaling. Temperature variations in thermal equilibrium rapidly change molecular transport properties. The coefficient of lipid self-diffusion increases exponentially with temperature in thermal equilibrium, for example. Hence, in the noisy cellular environment, where temperatures can fluctuate widely due to local heat generation, maintaining cellular homeostasis through molecular transport is hard in thermal equilibrium. In this paper, using both molecular and lattice-based modeling of membrane transport, we show that the presence of active transport originating from the cell's cytoskeleton can make the self-diffusion of the molecules on the membrane robust to temperature fluctuations. The resultant temperature-independence of self-diffusion keeps the precision of cellular signaling invariant over a broad range of ambient temperatures, allowing cells to make robust decisions. We have also found that the Kawasaki algorithm, the widely used model of lipid transport on lattices, predicts incorrect temperature dependence of lipid self-diffusion in equilibrium. We propose a new algorithm that correctly captures the equilibrium properties of lipid self-diffusion and reproduces experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Swirling due to misaligned perception-dependent motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of particles with motility variable in terms of a vision-type of perception is here investigated by a combination of Langevin dynamics simulations in two-dimensional systems and an analytical approach based on conservation law principles. Persistent swirling with predetermined direction is here induced by differentiating the self-propulsion direction and the perception cone axis. Clusters can have a fluid-like center with a rotating outer layer, or display a solid-like rotation driven by the outer layer activity. Discontinuous motility with misaligned perception might therefore serve as a powerful self-organization strategy in micro-robots.</description>

      <title>Emergent intelligence of buckling-driven elasto-active structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatio-temportal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Very much like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion such that controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel yet simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent intelligent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structure with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit intelligent behaviors such as maze navigation. The findings are relevant to designing intelligent materials or soft robots capable of autonomous space exploration, adaptation, and interaction with the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Millisecond-resolved infrared spectroscopy study of polymer brush swelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the study of millisecond-resolved polymer brush swelling dynamics using infrared spectroscopy with a custom-built quantum cascade laser-based infrared spectrometer at a 1 kHz sampling rate after averaging. By cycling the humidity of the environment of the polymer brush, we are able to measure the swelling dynamics sequentially at different wavenumbers. The high sampling rate provides us with information on the reconformation of the brush at a higher temporal resolution than previously reported. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we study the brush swelling dynamics as a reference experiment and to correct artefacts of the infrared measurement approach. This technique informs on the changes in the brush thickness and refractive index. Our results indicate that the swelling dynamics of the polymer brush are poorly described by Fickian diffusion and the Berens-Hopfenberg formalism, pointing toward more complicated underlying transport.</description>

      <title>Faceted wrinkling by contracting a curved boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03552v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-mode deformations of two-dimensional materials, such as the Miura-ori zig-zag fold, are important to the design of deployable structures because of their robustness; these usually require careful pre-patterning of the material. Here we show that inward contraction of a curved boundary produces a fine wrinkle pattern with a novel structure that suggests similar single-mode characteristics, but with minimal pre-patterning. Using finite-element representation of the contraction of a thin circular annular sheet, we show that these sheets wrinkle into a structure well approximated by an isometric structure composed of conical sectors and flat, triangular facets. Isometry favours the restriction of such deformations to a robust low-bending energy channel that avoids stretching. This class of buckling offers a novel way to manipulate sheet morphology via boundary forces.</description>

      <title>Kinetic glass transition in granular gases and non-linear molecular fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate, both analytically and numerically, the emergence of a kinetic glass transition in two different model systems: a uniformly heated granular gas and a molecular fluid with nonlinear drag. Despite the profound differences between these two physical systems, their behavior in thermal cycles share strong similarities, which stem from the relaxation time diverging algebraically at low temperatures for both systems. When the driving intensity -- -for the granular gas -- or the bath temperature -- for the molecular fluid -- is decreased to sufficiently low values, the kinetic temperature of both systems becomes ``frozen" at a value that depends on the cooling rate through a power law with the same exponent. Interestingly, this frozen glassy state is universal in the following sense: for a suitable rescaling of the relevant variables, its velocity distribution function becomes independent of the cooling rate. Upon reheating, i.e., when either the driving intensity or the bath temperature is increased from this frozen state, hysteresis cycles arise and the apparent heat capacity displays a maximum. The numerical results obtained from the simulations are well described by a perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Critical slowing down in thermal soft-sphere glasses via energy minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using hybrid molecular dynamics/SWAP Monte Carlo (MD/SMC) simulations, we show that the terminal relaxation times $\tau$ for FIRE energy minimization of soft-sphere glasses exhibit thermal onset as samples become increasingly well-equilibrated. Although $\tau(\phi)$ can decrease by orders of magnitude as equilibration proceeds and the jamming density $\phi_{\rm J}$ increases via thermal onset, it always scales as $\tau(\phi) \sim (\phi_{\rm J} - \phi)^{-2} \sim [Z_{\rm iso} - Z_{\rm ms}(\tau)]^{-2}$, where $\phi_{\rm J}$ is the jamming density and $Z_{\rm ms}(\tau)$ is the average coordination number of particles satisfying a minimal local mechanical stability criterion ($Z \geq d+1$) at the top of the final potential-energy-landscape (PEL) sub-basin the system encounters. This scaling allows us to collapse $\tau$ datasets that look very different when plotted as a function of $\phi$, and to address a closely related question: how does the character of the PEL basins that dense thermal glasses most typically occupy evolve as the glasses age at constant $\phi$ and $T$?</description>

      <title>Emulsions in microfluidic channels with asymmetric boundary conditions and directional surface roughness: stress and rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow of emulsions in confined microfluidic channels is affected by surface roughness. Directional roughness effects have recently been reported in channels with asymmetric boundary conditions featuring a flat wall, and a wall textured with a directional roughness, the latter promoting a change in the velocity profiles when the flow direction of emulsions is inverted [D. Filippi et al., Adv. Mater. Technol. 8, 2201748 (2023)]. An operative protocol is needed to reconstruct the stress profile inside the channel from velocity data to shed light on the trigger of the directional response. To this aim, we performed lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations of the flow of model emulsions with a minimalist model of directional roughness in two dimensions: a confined microfluidic channel with one flat wall and the other patterned by right-angle triangular-shaped posts. Simulations are essential to develop the protocol based on mechanical arguments to reconstruct stress profiles. Hence, one can analyze data to relate directional effects in velocity profiles to different rheological responses close to the rough walls associated with opposite flow directions. We finally show the universality of this protocol by applying it to other realizations of directional roughness by considering experimental data on emulsions in a microfluidic channel featured with a flat wall and a wall textured by herringbone-shaped roughness.</description>

      <title>Unveiling interatomic distances influencing the reaction coordinates in alanine dipeptide isomerization: An explainable deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work shows that the free energy landscape associated with alanine dipeptide isomerization can be effectively represented by specific interatomic distances without explicit reference to dihedral angles. Conventionally, two stable states of alanine dipeptide in vacuum, i.e., C$7_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ($\beta$-sheet structure) and C$7_{\mathrm{ax}}$ (left handed $\alpha$-helix structure), have been primarily characterized using the main chain dihedral angles, $\varphi$ (C-N-C$_\alpha$-C) and $\psi$ (N-C$_\alpha$-C-N). However, our recent deep learning combined with "Explainable AI" (XAI) framework has shown that the transition state can be adequately captured by a free energy landscape using $\varphi$ and $\theta$ (O-C-N-C$_\alpha$) [T. Kikutsuji, et al. J. Chem. Phys. 156, 154108 (2022)]. In perspective of extending these insights to other collective variables, a more detailed characterization of transition state is required. In this work, we employ the interatomic distances and bond angles as input variables for deep learning, rather than the conventional and more elaborate dihedral angles. Our approach utilizes deep learning to investigate whether changes in the main chain dihedral angle can be expressed in terms of interatomic distances and bond angles. Furthermore, by incorporating XAI into our predictive analysis, we quantified the importance of each input variable and succeeded in clarifying the specific interatomic distance that affects the transition state. The results indicate that constructing a free energy landscape based on using the identified interatomic distance can clearly distinguish between the two stable states and provide a comprehensive explanation for the energy barrier crossing.</description>
