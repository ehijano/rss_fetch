      <title>Parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1992, Bitar and Goles introduced the parallel chip-firing game on undirected graphs. Two years later, Prisner extended the game to directed graphs. While the properties of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs have been extensively studied, their analogs for parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs have been sporadic. In this paper, we prove the outstanding analogs of the core results of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs for those on directed graphs. We find the possible periods of a parallel chip-firing game on a directed simple cycle and use Gauss-Jordan Elimination on a Laplacian-like matrix to establish a lower bound on the maximum period of a parallel chip-firing game on a directed complete graph and a directed complete bipartite graph. Finally, we use the method of motors by Jiang, Scully, and Zhang to show that a binary string $s$ can be the atomic firing sequence of a vertex in a parallel chip-firing game on a strongly connected directed graph if and only if $s$ contains 1 or $s=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph is a graph in which every edge carries a $+$ or a $-$ sign. In this paper, we determine the signed graphs with maximum spectral radius among all unbalanced signed graphs with fixed order that contain neither negative three-cycles nor negative four-cycles.</description>

      <title>Regular polytopes of rank $n/2$ for transitive groups of degree $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research established that the maximal rank of the abstract regular polytopes whose automorphism group is a transitive proper subgroup of $\Sym_n$ is $n/2 + 1$, with only two polytopes attaining this rank, both of which having odd ranks.
  In this paper, we investigate the case where the rank is equal to $n/2$ ($n\geq 14$). Our analysis reveals that reducing the rank by one results in a substantial increase in the number of regular polytopes ($33$ distinct families are discovered) covering all possible ranks (even and odd).</description>

      <title>A generalization of conjugation of integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit, for any positive integer parameter $s$, an involution on the set of integer partitions of $n$. These involutions show the joint symmetry of the distributions of the following two statistics. The first counts the number of parts of a partition divisible by $s$, whereas the second counts the number of cells in the Ferrers diagram of a partition whose leg length is zero and whose arm length has remainder $s-1$ when dividing by $s$. In particular, for $s=1$ this involution is just conjugation. Additionally, we provide explicit expressions for the bivariate generating functions.
  Our primary motivation to construct these involutions is that we know only of two other "natural" bijections on integer partitions of a given size, one of which is the Glaisher-Franklin bijection sending the set of parts divisible by $s$, each divided by $s$, to the set of parts occurring at least $s$ times.</description>

      <title>Coplanarity of rooted spanning-tree vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a recent technology of tree surgery we prove a ``deletion-constriction'' formula for products of rooted spanning trees on weighted directed graphs that generalizes deletion-contraction on undirected graphs. The formula implies that, letting $\tau_x^\varnothing$, $\tau_x^+$, and $\tau_x^-$ be the rooted spanning tree polynomials obtained respectively by removing an edge in both directions or by forcing the tree to pass through either direction of that edge, the vectors $(\tau_x^\varnothing, \tau_x^+, \tau_x^-)$ are coplanar for all roots $x$. We deploy the result to give an alternative derivation of a recently found mutual linearity of stationary currents of Markov chains. We generalize deletion-constriction and current linearity among two edges, and conjecture that similar results may hold for arbitrary subsets of edges.</description>

      <title>Non commutative multidimensional stronger Central Sets Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hindman's theorem and van der Waerden's theorem are two classical Ramsey theoretic results, the first one deals with finite configurations and the second one deals with infinite configurations. The Central Sets Theorem due to Furstenberg is a strong simultaneous extension of both theorems, which also applies to general commutative semigroups. Beiglboeck provided a common extension of the Central Sets Theorem and Milliken-Taylor Theorem in commutative case. Furstenberg's original Central Sets Theorem was proved in \cite{key-2} for $\left(\mathbb{N},+\right)$ for finitely many sequences at a time. Bergelson and Hindman provided a non commutative version of this Theorem \cite{key-3}. Hindman, Maleki and Straus extended the Central Sets Theorem for commutative semigroup using countable many sequence at a time \cite{key-8-1}. The first author of this article jointly with Hindman and Straus provided a non-commutative version of Central Sets Theorem using arbitrary many sequence at a time \cite{key-5}. In this work we will provide a non-commutative extension of Beiglboeck's Theorem. We also provide polynomial generalization of Beiglbock's theorem.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Real-Rooted Polynomials with Mixed Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize compatible families of real-rooted polynomials, allowing both positive and negative leading coefficients. Our characterization naturally generalizes the same-sign characterization used by Chudnovsky and Seymour in their famous 2007 paper proving the real-rootedness of independence polynomials of claw-free graphs, thus fully settling a question left open in their paper. Our methods are generally speaking elementary, utilizing mainly linear algebra and the established theory of interlacing polynomials, with a bit of invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Operational Umbral Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16348v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of almost purely operational methods in the study of umbral calculus. To accomplish this goal, we systematically reconstruct the theory operationally, offering new proofs and results throughout. Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power series, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion theorem and derive formulas for both fractional and regular compositional iterates, for which the latter is new. In addition, we will develop several new insights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel expressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally, we will elaborate on both established and new concepts and examples, such as pseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Large matchings and nearly spanning, nearly regular subgraphs of random subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and $p\in [0,1]$, the random subgraph $G_p$ is obtained by retaining each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p$. We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $d\ge C$ be an integer, let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph and let $p\ge \frac{C}{d}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $|V(G)|$ tends to infinity, there exists a matching in $G_p$ covering at least $(1-\epsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices.
  We further show that for a wide family of $d$-regular graphs $G$, which includes the $d$-dimensional hypercube, for any $p\ge \frac{\log^5d}{d}$ with probability tending to one as $d$ tends to infinity, $G_p$ contains an induced subgraph on at least $(1-o(1))|V(G)|$ vertices, whose degrees are tightly concentrated around the expected average degree $dp$.</description>

      <title>Multisorted Boolean Clones Determined by Binary Relations up to Minion Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the ordering of a class of clones by minion homomorphisms, also known as minor preserving maps or height 1 clone homomorphisms. The class consists of all clones on finite sets determined by binary relations whose projections to both coordinates have at most two elements. This class can be alternatively described up to minion homomorphisms as the class of multisorted Boolean clones determined by binary relations. We also introduce and apply the concept of a minion core which provides canonical representatives for equivalence classes of clones, more generally minions, on finite sets.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time recognition and maximum independent set in Burling graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Burling graph is an induced subgraph of some graph in Burling's construction of triangle-free high-chromatic graphs. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm which decides whether a given graph is a Burling graph and if it is, constructs its intersection model by rectangular frames. That model enables a polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum independent set problem in Burling graphs. As a consequence, we establish Burling graphs as the first known hereditary class of graphs that admits such an algorithm while not being $\chi$-bounded.</description>

Abstract: Much has been written about the golden ratio $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and this strange number appears mysteriously in many mathematical calculations. In this article, we review the appearance of this number in the graph theory. More precisely, we review the relevance of this number in topics such as the number of spanning trees, topological indices, energy, chromatic roots, domination roots and the number of domatic partitions of graphs.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for a problem of Littlewood on the zeros of cosine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z(N)$ denote the minimum number of zeros in $[0,2\pi]$ that a cosine polynomial of the form $$f_A(t)=\sum_{n\in A}\cos nt$$ can have when $A$ is a finite set of non-negative integers of size $|A|=N$. It is an old problem of Littlewood to determine $Z(N)$. In this paper, we obtain the lower bound $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log N)^{(1+o(1))}$ which exponentially improves on the previous best bounds of the form $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log\log N)^c$ due to Erd\'elyi and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: John von Neumann studied a simplified version of poker where the "deck" consists of infinitely many cards, in fact, all real numbers between $0$ and $1$. We harness the power of computation, both numeric and symbolic, to investigate analogs with finitely many cards. We also study finite analogs of a simplified poker introduced by D.J. Newman, and conclude with a thorough investigation, fully implemented in Maple, of the three-player game, doing both the finite and the infinite versions. This paper is accompanied by two Maple packages and numerous output files.</description>

      <title>Some $3$-designs invariant under $2.P{\Sigma}L(2,49).$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a ternary [49,25,7] code from the row span of a Jacobsthal matrix. It is equivalent to a Generalized Quadratic Residue (GQR) code in the sense of van Lint and MacWilliams (1978). These codes are the abelian generalizations of the quadratic residue (QR) codes which are cyclic. The union of the [50,25,8] extension of the said code and its dual supports a 3-(50,14,1248) design. The automorphism group of the latter design is a double cover of the permutation part of the automorphism group of the [50,25,8] code, which is isomorphic to $P{\Sigma}L(2,49).$ Other weights in this code, other GQR codes, and other QR codes yield other 3-designs by the same process. A simple group action argument is provided to explain this behaviour of isodual codes.</description>

      <title>Constrained coding upper bounds via Goulden-Jackson cluster theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in DNA-based data storage, constrained codes have attracted a considerable amount of attention from both academia and industry. We study the maximum cardinality of constrained codes for which the constraints can be characterized by a set of forbidden substrings, where by a substring we mean some consecutive coordinates in a string.
  For finite-type constrained codes (for which the set of forbidden substrings is finite), one can compute their capacity (code rate) by the ``spectral method'', i.e., by applying the Perron-Frobenious theorem to the de Brujin graph defined by the code. However, there was no systematic method to compute the exact cardinality of these codes.
  We show that there is a surprisingly powerful method arising from enumerative combinatorics, which is based on the Goulden-Jackson cluster theorem (previously not known to the coding community), that can be used to compute not only the capacity, but also the exact formula for the cardinality of these codes, for each fixed code length. Moreover, this can be done by solving a system of linear equations of size equal to the number of constraints.
  We also show that the spectral method and the cluster method are inherently related by establishing a direct connection between the spectral radius of the de Brujin graph used in the first method and the convergence radius of the generating function used in the second method.
  Lastly, to demonstrate the flexibility of the new method, we use it to give an explicit upper bound on the maximum cardinality of variable-length non-overlapping codes, which are a class of constrained codes defined by an infinite number of forbidden substrings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple $(1+\varepsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta = \Omega(\log n / \varepsilon)$ with running time $O\left(m\,\log^3 n/\varepsilon^3\right)$. Our algorithm improves upon that of [Duan, He, and Zhang; SODA19], which was the first near-linear time algorithm for this problem. While our results are weaker than the current state-of-the-art, our approach is significantly simpler, both in terms of analysis as well as implementation, and may be of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Inference of rankings planted in random tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring an unknown ranking of $n$ items from a random tournament on $n$ vertices whose edge directions are correlated with the ranking. We establish, in terms of the strength of these correlations, the computational and statistical thresholds for detection (deciding whether an observed tournament is purely random or drawn correlated with a hidden ranking) and recovery (estimating the hidden ranking with small error in Spearman's footrule or Kendall's tau metric on permutations). Notably, we find that this problem provides a new instance of a detection-recovery gap: solving the detection problem requires much weaker correlations than solving the recovery problem. In establishing these thresholds, we also identify simple algorithms for detection (thresholding a degree 2 polynomial) and recovery (outputting a ranking by the number of "wins" of a tournament vertex, i.e., the out-degree) that achieve optimal performance up to constants in the correlation strength. For detection, we find that the above low-degree polynomial algorithm is superior to a natural spectral algorithm. We also find that, whenever it is possible to achieve strong recovery (i.e., to estimate with vanishing error in the above metrics) of the hidden ranking, then the above "Ranking By Wins" algorithm not only does so, but also outputs a close approximation of the maximum likelihood estimator, a task that is NP-hard in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Repeated Block Averages: entropic time and mixing profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider randomized dynamics over the $n$-simplex, where at each step a random set, or block, of coordinates is evenly averaged. When all blocks have size 2, this reduces to the repeated averages studied in [CDSZ22], a version of the averaging process on a graph [AL12]. We study the convergence to equilibrium of this process as a function of the distribution of the block size, and provide sharp conditions for the emergence of the cutoff phenomenon. Moreover, we characterize the size of the cutoff window and provide an explicit Gaussian cutoff profile. To complete the analysis, we study in detail the simplified case where the block size is not random. We show that the absence of a cutoff is equivalent to having blocks of size $n^{\Omega(1)}$, in which case we provide a convergence in distribution for the total variation distance at any given time, showing that, on the proper time scale, it remains constantly 1 up to an exponentially distributed random time, after which it decays following a Poissonian profile.</description>

      <title>Berge-$k$-factors in tough hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chv\'atal in 1973 introduced the concept of graph toughness and initiated the study of sufficient toughness conditions for the existence of hamiltonian cycles in graphs.
  Over the years, numerous results related to graph toughness have been proved. Notably, Enomoto, Jackson, Katerinis, and Saito (1985) established a renowned theorem stating that for every integer $k\ge 1$, any $k$-tough graph $G$ possesses a $k$-factor if $k |V(G)|$ is even and $|V(G)|\ge k+1$.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of toughness conditions for the existence of substructures in hypergraphs. Specifically, we extend the aforementioned result concerning $k$-factors in graphs to Berge-$k$-factors in hypergraphs. The proof of this extension presents a unique challenge due to the inherent non-uniformity of hypergraphs compared to graphs, and our proof techniques are of independent interest for similar investigations.</description>

      <title>Towards studying the structure of triple Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Going beyond the studies of single and double Hurwitz numbers, we report some progress towards studying Hurwitz numbers which correspond to ramified coverings of the Riemann sphere involving three nonsimple branch points. We first prove a recursion which implies a fundamental identity of Frobenius enumerating factorizations of a permutation in group algebra theory. We next apply the recursion to study Hurwitz numbers involving three nonsimple branch points (besides simple ones),two of them having deterministic ramification profiles while the remaining one having a prescribed number of preimages. The recursion allows us to obtain recurrences as well as explicit formulas for these numbers which also generalize a number of existing results on single and double Hurwitz numbers. The case where one of the nonsimple branch points with deterministic profile has a unique preimage (one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers {or $(1,m)$-part triple Hurwitz numbers}) is particularly studied in detail. We prove an attractive dimension-reduction formula from which any one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz number can be reduced to quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers where both with deterministic profiles are fully ramified. We also obtain the polynomiality of one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers analogous to that implied by the remarkable ELSV formula for single Hurwitz numbers, and discuss the potential connection to intersection theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing the equality conditions of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality has been a major open problem for decades. We prove that in the case of convex polytopes, this description is not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level. This is the first hardness result for the problem, and is a complexity counterpart of the recent result by Shenfeld and van Handel (arXiv:archive/201104059), which gave a geometric characterization of the equality conditions. The proof involves Stanley's order polytopes and employs poset theoretic technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density of a subgroupoid with respect to a free groupoid is defined as the asymptotic ratio of their growths. This notion can be interpreted as a generalisation of the index's inverse for groups or as the probability of an element belonging to a subgroupoid. This more combinatorial strategy shows a richer picture of free groupoids than the bare algebraic perspective. We study the growth and density of several subgroupoids of a free groupoid. In addition, some aspects of enumeration related to the Motzkin paths are shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stanley asked whether a tree is determined up to isomorphism by its chromatic symmetric function. We approach Stanley's problem by studying the relationship between the chromatic symmetric function and other invariants. First, we prove Crew's conjecture that the chromatic symmetric function of a tree determines its generalized degree sequence, which enumerates vertex subsets by cardinality and the numbers of internal and external edges. Second, we prove that the restriction of the generalized degree sequence to subtrees contains exactly the same information as the subtree polynomial, which enumerates subtrees by cardinality and number of leaves. Third, we construct arbitrarily large families of trees sharing the same subtree polynomial, proving and generalizing a conjecture of Eisenstat and Gordon.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in triangle-free graphs of bounded maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $\textit{identifying code}$ of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhood and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every connected closed-twin-free graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+c$. In [D. Chakraborty, F. Foucaud, M. A. Henning, and T. Lehtil\"{a}. Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree: Characterizing trees. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.13172, 2024], we proved the conjecture for all trees. In this article, we show that the conjecture holds for all triangle-free graphs, with the same list of exceptional graphs needing $c&gt;0$ as for trees: for $\Delta\ge 3$, $c=1/3$ suffices and there is only a set of 12 trees requiring $c&gt;0$ for $\Delta=3$, and when $\Delta\ge 4$ this set is reduced to the $\Delta$-star only. Our proof is by induction, whose starting point is the above result for trees. Along the way, we prove a generalized version of Bondy's theorem on induced subsets [J. A. Bondy. Induced subsets. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 1972] that we use as a tool in our proofs. We also use our main result for triangle-free graphs, to prove the upper bound $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+1/\Delta+4t$ for graphs that can be made triangle-free by the removal of $t$ edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abelian sandpile model was the first example of a self-organized critical system studied by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld. The dynamics of the sandpiles occur when the grains topple over a graph. In this study, we allow the graph to evolve over time and change the topology at each stage. This turns out in the occurrence of phenomena impossible in the classical sandpile models. For instance, configurations over evolutive graphs that are always unstable. We also experiment with the stabilization of configurations with a large number of grains at the center over evolutive graphs, this allows us to obtain interesting fractals. Finally, we obtain some power laws associated with some evolutive graphs.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Distribution on "Short" Integer Partitions with Power Parts: Limit Laws and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a family of Boltzmann (multiplicative) distributions over the set $\check{\varLambda}^{q}$ of strict integer partitions (i.e., with unequal parts) into perfect $q$-th powers. A combinatorial link is provided via a suitable conditioning by fixing the partition weight (the sum of parts) and length (the number of parts), leading to uniform distribution on the corresponding subspaces of partitions. The Boltzmann measure is calibrated through the hyper-parameters $\langle N\rangle$ and $\langle M\rangle$ controlling the expected weight and length, respectively. We study ``short'' partitions, where the parameter $\langle M\rangle$ is either fixed or grows slower than for typical plain (unconstrained) partitions. For this model, we obtain a variety of limit theorems including the asymptotics of the cumulative cardinality in the case of fixed $\langle M\rangle$ and a limit shape result in the case of slow growth of $\langle M\rangle$. In both cases, we also characterize the joint distribution of the weight and length, as well as the growth of the smallest and largest parts. Using these results we construct suitable sampling algorithms and analyse their performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the notion of operad that we call a contractad, whose set of operations is indexed by connected graphs and whose composition rules are numbered by contractions of connected subgraphs. We show that many classical operads, such as the operad of commutative algebras, Lie algebras, associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, the little disks operad, and the operad of moduli spaces of stable curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ admit generalizations to contractads. We explain that standard tools like Koszul duality and the machinery of Gr\"obner bases can be easily generalized to contractads. We verify the Koszul property of the commutative, Lie, associative, and Gerstenhaber contractads.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository paper. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. E.g., a cycle in the sense of graph theory is a $1$-cycle, but not vice versa. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. In this text we study the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all 1-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of 1-cycles in a given graph such that any 1-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We also consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, and to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Owings-like theorems for infinitely many colours or finite monochromatic sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; this is known to be false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the large size limit of the moment formula derived in \cite{DHS} for the Hermitian Jacobi process at fixed time. Our computations rely on the polynomial division algorithm which allows to obtain cancellations similar to those obtained in Lemma 3 in \cite{Bia}. In particular, we identify the terms contributing to the limit and show they satisfy a double recurrence relation. We also determine explicitly some of them and revisit a special case relying on Carlitz summation identity for terminating $1$-balanced ${}_4F_3$ functions taken at unity.</description>
