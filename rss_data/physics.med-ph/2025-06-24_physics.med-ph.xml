      <title>Exploring Strategies for Personalized Radiation Therapy Part II Predicting Tumor Drift Patterns with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However, current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically informed radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Strategies for Personalized Radiation Therapy Part I Unlocking Response-Related Tumor Subregions with Class Activation Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity. Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight, identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns, demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover, its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data, supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy strategies for both photon and particle therapies.</description>

      <title>A unipolar head gradient for high-field MRI without encoding ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: MRI gradients with a conventional, bipolar design generally face a trade-off between performance, encoding ambiguity, and circumventing the latter by means of RF selectivity. This problem is particularly limiting in cutting-edge brain imaging performed at field strengths &gt;= 7T and using high-performance head gradients. Methods: To address this issue, the present work proposes to fundamentally eliminate the encoding ambiguity in head gradients by using a unipolar z-gradient design that takes advantage of the signal-free range on one side of the imaging volume. This concept is demonstrated by implementation of a unipolar head gradient for operation at 7T. Results: Imaging in phantoms and in vivo demonstrates elimination of backfolding due to encoding ambiguity. At the same time, the unipolar design achieves efficiency on par with conventional bipolar design, resulting in high amplitude and slew-rate performance. Conclusion: The prospect of gradient systems based on a unipolar design holds promise for all advanced neuroimaging that demands high gradient performance. It will make the greatest difference at 7T and beyond where the absence of ambiguity removes a key concern and constraint in terms of RF behaviour and instrumentation.</description>

      <title>The role of dendritic spines in water exchange measurements with diffusion MRI: Time-Dependent Single Diffusion Encoding MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) with single diffusion encoding (SDE) probes water dynamics in biological tissues, but signal interpretation depends on microstructure. While prior work focused on restricted/hindered diffusion and membrane permeation, diffusion-mediated exchange between dendritic shafts and spines in gray matter (GM) remains understudied. We hypothesize that impermeable spiny dendrites produce time-dependent SDE signals mimicking permeative exchange and investigate how spine density biases exchange time estimates.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and narrow escape theory, we quantify spine-shaft exchange times (3-26 ms), matching cortical permeative exchange estimates. A modified two-compartment Karger model characterizes time-dependent SDE signals but yields biased exchange estimates, reflecting spine volume fraction rather than morphology. Unaccounted diffusion-mediated exchange introduces up to 80% bias in NEXI/SMEX model estimates. We propose an extended three-compartment Karger model incorporating both diffusion-mediated (spine-shaft) and permeative (intra-extracellular) exchange. However, this model cannot uniquely separate membrane permeability from spine volume effects.
  Our findings emphasize that dendritic spines should be considered in SDE-based exchange studies and caution against attributing exchange solely to permeability. Advanced methods are needed to disentangle these mechanisms in GM.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties of a Spherical Magnetic Field Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical harmonic expansions are well-established tools for estimating magnetic fields from surface measurements and are widely used in applications such as tomographic imaging, geomagnetism, and biomagnetism. Although the mathematical foundations of these expansions are well understood, the impact of real-world imperfections, on the uncertainty of the field model has received little attention. In this work, we present a systematic uncertainty propagation analysis for a magnetic field camera that estimates the field from surface measurements using a spherical array of Hall magnetometers arranged in a spherical t-design. A Monte Carlo-based approach is employed to quantify how sensor-related uncertainties, such as calibration errors and positioning inaccuracies, affect the spatial distribution of the estimated field's uncertainty. The results offer insights into the robustness of spherical harmonic methods and help identify the dominant sources of uncertainty in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Boosting biocompatibility and mechanical property evolution in a high-entropy alloy via nanostructure engineering and phase transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as multi-component materials with high configurational entropy, have garnered significant attention as new biomaterials; still, their low yield stress and high elastic modulus need to be overcome for future biomedical applications. In this study, nanograin generation is used to enhance the strength and phase transformation is employed to reduce the elastic modulus of a biocompatible Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-based HEA. The alloy is treated via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) process, leading to (i) a BCC (body-centered cubic) to omega phase transformation with [101]{\omega}//[011]BCC and [211]omega//[121]BCC through a twining mechanism, (ii) nanograin formation with a mean grain size of 20 nm, and (iii) dislocation generation particularly close to BCC-omega interphase boundaries. These structural and microstructural features enhance hardness, increase tensile strength up to 2130 MPa, achieve tensile elongation exceeding 13%, reduce elastic modulus down to 69 GPa and improve biocompatibility. Additionally, the HEA exhibits improved anodization, resulting in a homogenous distribution of oxide nanotubes on the surface with a smaller tube diameter and a higher tube length compared to pure titanium. These remarkable properties, which are engineered by the generation of defective nanograins and the co-existence of BCC and metastable omega phases, highlight the potential of HEAs treated using severe plastic deformation for future biomedical usage, particularly in the orthopedic sector.</description>

      <title>A Selection of Distributions and Their Fourier Transforms with Applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a rigorous introduction to a selection of distributions along with their Fourier transforms, which are commonly encountered in signal processing and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to many textbooks on the principles of MRI, which place more emphasis on the signal processing aspect, this note will take a more mathematical approach. In particular, we will make explicit the underlying topological space of interest and clarify the exact sense in which these distributions and their Fourier transforms are defined. Key results presented in this note involve the Poisson summation formula and the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) argument, etc. Although the readers are expected to have prior exposure to functional analysis and distribution theory, this note is intended to be self-contained.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomy features. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. For post-MI women, the heart is positioned more posteriorly and vertically, than in men (with healthy women yet more vertical). Post-MI women exhibit less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS is associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women is striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women (but not in men). Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling in Wavelet Coefficient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attenuation correction (AC) is necessary for accurate activity quantification in positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional reconstruction methods typically rely on attenuation maps derived from a co-registered computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, this additional scan may complicate the imaging workflow, introduce misalignment artifacts and increase radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation (JRAA) approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary anatomical imaging by relying solely on emission data. This framework combines wavelet diffusion model (WDM) and diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) to reconstruct fully three-dimensional (3-D) data. Experimental results show our method outperforms maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) and MLAA with UNet-based post processing, and yields high-quality noise-free reconstructions across various count settings when time-of-flight (TOF) information is available. It is also able to reconstruct non-TOF data, although the reconstruction quality significantly degrades in low-count (LC) conditions, limiting its practical effectiveness in such settings. This approach represents a step towards stand-alone PET imaging by reducing the dependence on anatomical modalities while maintaining quantification accuracy, even in low-count scenarios when TOF information is available.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation and Dosimetric Analysis of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) in Breast Tissue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise radiation delivery is critical for effective radiotherapy, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance local dose deposition while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to investigate the dosimetry of AuNPs under different conditions and models. The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied in water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with previously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of the particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the AuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as expected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that in the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from photoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which were analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation between number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model (LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at different gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in analysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic assays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed. This led to the development of a new, mechanistic, Local Effect Model which, if further validated, can have further applications in-vitro and in-silico.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.</description>
