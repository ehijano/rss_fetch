      <title>A deep implicit-explicit minimizing movement method for option pricing in jump-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket options written on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: (a) a sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and (b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of these methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model, while a comparison with the deep Galerkin method and the deep BSDE solver with jumps further supports the merits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Market Simulation under Adverse Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of fill probabilities and adverse fills on the trading strategy simulation process. We specifically focus on a stochastic optimal control market-making problem and test the strategy on ES (E-mini S\&amp;P 500), NQ (E-mini Nasdaq 100), CL (Crude Oil) and ZN (10-Year Treasury Note), which are some of the most liquid futures contracts listed on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). We provide empirical evidence that shows how fill probabilities and adverse fills can significantly affect performance and propose a more prudent simulation framework to deal with this. Many previous works aim to measure different types of adverse selection in the limit order book (LOB), however, they often simulate price processes and market orders independently. This has the ability to largely inflate the performance of a short-term style trading strategy. Our studies show that using more realistic fill probabilities and tracking adverse fills in the strategy simulation process more accurately shows how these types of trading strategies would perform in reality.</description>

      <title>Moments by Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to detect wash trading in crypto assets through real-time liquidity fluctuation. We propose that short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from wash trading-induced liquidity fluctuation, and construct two complementary liquidity measures, liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (volatility of fluctuation), to capture the behavioral signature of wash trading. Using US stocks as a benchmark, we demonstrate that joint elevation in both liquidity metrics indicates wash trading in crypto assets. A simulated regulatory treatment that removes likely wash trades confirms this dynamic: it reduces liquidity diffusion significantly while leaving liquidity jump largely unaffected. These findings align with a theoretical model in which manipulative traders amplify both the level and variance of price pressure, whereas passive investors affect only the level. Our model offers practical tools for investors to assess market quality and for regulators to monitor manipulation risk on crypto exchanges without oversight.</description>
