      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.</description>

      <title>Strategic Learning and Trading in Broker-Mediated Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strategic interactions in a broker-mediated market. A broker provides liquidity to an informed trader and to noise traders while managing inventory in the lit market. The broker and the informed trader maximise their trading performance while filtering each other's private information; the trader estimates the broker's trading activity in the lit market while the broker estimates the informed trader's private signal. Brokers hold a strategic advantage over traders who rely solely on prices to filter information. We find that information leakage in the client's trading flow yields an economic value to the broker that is comparable to transaction costs; she speculates profitably and mitigates risk effectively, which, in turn, adversely impacts the informed trader's performance. In contrast, low signal-to-noise sources, such as prices, result in the broker's trading performance being indistinguishable from that of a naive strategy that internalises noise flow, externalises informed flow, and offloads inventory at a constant rate.</description>
