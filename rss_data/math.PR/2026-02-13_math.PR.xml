      <title>Noncentral limit results for spatiotemporal random fields on manifolds and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives noncentral limit results (NCLTs) for suitable scaling of functionals of spatially homogeneous and isotropic, and stationary in time, LRD Gaussian subordinated Spatiotemporal Random Fields (STRFs) with Hermite rank equal to two. The cases of connected and compact two point homogeneous spaces M_{d} in R^{d+1}, and compact convex sets K in R^{d+1},$ whose interior has positive Lebesgue measure, are analyzed. These NCLTs are obtained in the second Wiener Chaos by applying reduction theorems. The methodological approaches adopted in the derivation of these results are based on the pure point and continuous spectra of the Gaussian STRFs subordinators defined on M_{d} and K, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the effect of graph structure on strong Feller property of SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the structure of the underlying graph influences the behavior of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on finite tree graphs, where each edge is driven by space-time white noise. We first introduce a novel graph-based null decomposition approach to analyzing the strong Feller property of the Markov semigroup generated by SPDEs on tree graphs. By examining the positions of zero entries in eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian operator, we establish a sharp upper bound on the number of noise-free edges that ensures both the strong Feller property and irreducibility. Interestingly, we find that the addition of noise to any single edge is sufficient for chain graphs, whereas for star graphs, at most one edge can remain noise-free without compromising the system's properties. Furthermore, under a dissipative condition, we prove the existence and exponential ergodicity of a unique invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Random points on $\mathbb{S}^3$ with small logarithmic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse several constructions of random point sets on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{3}\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ evaluating and comparing them through their discrete logarithmic energy: \begin{equation*}
  E_0(\omega_N) =
  \sum_{\substack{i, j=1\\ i \neq j}}^{N}
  \log\frac{1}{\|x_i - x_j\|},
  \; \text{ where}\; \omega_N=\{x_1,\ldots,x_N\} \subset \mathbb{S}^3. \end{equation*} Using the Hopf fibration, we lift a range of well-distributed families of points from the $2$-dimensional sphere - including uniformly random points, antipodally symmetric sets, determinantal point processes, and the Diamond ensemble - to $\mathbb{S}^{3}$, in order to assess their energy performance. In particular, we carry out this asymptotic analysis for the Spherical ensemble (a well known determinantal point process on $\mathbb{S}^2$), obtaining as a result a family of points on the $3$-dimensional sphere whose logarithmic energy is asymptotically the lowest achieved to date. This, in turn, provides a new upper bound for the minimal logarithmic energy on $\mathbb{S}^3$. Although an analytic treatment of the lifted Diamond ensemble remains elusive, extensive simulations presented here show that its empirical energies lie below all other deterministic and non-deterministic constructions considered. Together, these results sharpen the quantitative link between potential-theoretic optima on $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{3}$ and provide both theoretical and numerical benchmarks for future work.</description>

      <title>Tree Capacity and Splitting Isometries for Subinvariant Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a subinvariant positive definite kernel under a branching pullback, we attach to the resulting kernel tower a canonical electrical network on the word tree whose edge weights are the diagonal increments. This converts diagonal growth into effective resistance and capacity, giving explicit criteria and quantitative bounds, together with a matching upper bound under a mild level regularity condition. When the diagonal tower has finite limit at a point, we prove convergence of the full kernels and obtain an invariant completion with a minimality property. We also describe the associated RKHS splitting and a boundary martingale construction leading to weighted invariant majorants.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization for Nonuniform Densities on Spherical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of optimal quantization of probability measures with nonuniform densities on spherical curves. We begin by deriving the centroid condition, followed by a high-resolution asymptotic analysis to establish the point-density formula. We further quantify the asymptotic error formula for the nonuniform densities. We apply these theorems to the von Mises distributions and characterize the optimal condition. We also provide applications using the high-resolution asymptotic and its corresponding error formula. Our results can be used in geometric probability theory and quantization theory of spherical curves.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Peng's Maximum Principle for McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the proof of Peng's maximum principle for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDE). The main step is the introduction of a third adjoint equation, a conditional McKean-Vlasov backward SDE, to accommodate the dualization of quadratic terms containing two independent copies of the first-order variational process. This is an intrinsic extension of the maximum principle from Peng for standard SDE and gives a conceptually consistent proof. Our approach will be useful in further extensions to the common noise setting and the infinite dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Increasing Propagation of Chaos and its breakdown for the Hopfield Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze increasing propagation of chaos in the high temperature regime of a disordered mean-field model, the Hopfield model. We show that for $\beta&lt;1$ (the true high temperature region) we have increasing propagation of chaos as long as the size of the marginals $k=k(N)$ and the number of patterns
  $M=M(N)$ satisfies $Mk/N \to 0$. For $M=o(\sqrt N)$ we show that propagation of chaos breaks down for $k/N \to c&gt;0$. At the ciritcal temperature we show that, for $M$ finite, there
  is increasing propagation of chaos, for $k=o(\sqrt N)$, while we have breakdown of
  propagation of chaos for $k=c \sqrt N$, for a $c&gt;0$. All these reulst hold in probability in the disorder.</description>

      <title>On the implicit regularization of Langevin dynamics with projected noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics with noise projected onto the directions orthogonal to an isometric group action. This mathematical model is introduced to shed new light on the effects of symmetry on stochastic gradient descent for over-parametrized models. Our main result identifies a novel form of implicit regularization: when the initial and target density are both invariant under the group action, Langevin dynamics with projected noise is equivalent in law to Langevin dynamics with isotropic diffusion but with an additional drift term proportional to the negative log volume of the group orbit. We prove this result by constructing a coupling of the two processes via a third process on the group itself, and identify the additional drift as the mean curvature of the orbits.</description>

      <title>Half-plane non-coexistence without FKG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\mu$ an edge percolation measure on the infinite square lattice, let $\mu_{\textit{hp}}$ (respectively, $\mu^*_{hp}$) denote its marginal (respectively, the marginal of its planar dual process) on the upper half-plane. We show that if $\mu$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and almost surely has only finitely many infinite clusters, then either almost surely $\mu_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster, or almost surely $\mu^*_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster. By the classical Burton--Keane argument, these hypotheses are satisfied if $\mu$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and has finite-energy. In contrast to previous ``non-coexistence'' theorems, our result does not impose a positive-correlation (FKG) hypothesis on $\mu$. Our arguments also apply to the random-cluster model (including the regime $q&lt;1$, which lacks FKG), the uniform spanning tree, and the uniform odd subgraph.</description>

      <title>An Improved Upper Bound for the Euclidean TSP Constant Using Band Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $n$ points generated uniformly at random in the unit square, and let $L_n$ be the length of their optimal traveling salesman tour. Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley (1959) showed $L_n / \sqrt n \to \beta$ almost surely as $n\to \infty$ for some constant $\beta$. The exact value of $\beta$ is unknown but estimated to be approximately $0.71$ (Applegate, Bixby, Chv\'atal, Cook 2011). Beardwood et al. further showed that $0.625 \leq \beta \leq 0.92116.$ Currently, the best known bounds are $0.6277 \leq \beta \leq 0.90380$, due to Gaudio and Jaillet (2019) and Carlsson and Yu (2023), respectively. The upper bound was derived using a computer-aided approach that is amenable to lower bounds with improved computation speed. In this paper, we show via simulation and concentration analysis that future improvement of the $0.90380$ is limited to $\sim0.88$. Moreover, we provide an alternative tour-constructing heuristic that, via simulation, could potentially improve the upper bound to $\sim0.85$. Our approach builds on a prior \emph{band-traversal} strategy, initially proposed by Beardwood et al. (1959) and subsequently refined by Carlsson and Yu (2023): divide the unit square into bands of height $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, construct paths within each band, and then connect the paths to create a TSP tour. Our approach allows paths to cross bands, and takes advantage of pairs of points in adjacent bands which are close to each other. A rigorous numerical analysis improves the upper bound to $0.90367$.</description>

      <title>Prescribed distinct-digit growth in countable alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of distinct symbols appearing in digit expansions generated by full-branch affine countable iterated function systems is studied whose branch weights are regularly varying. The Hausdorff dimensions of the exceptional sets in which the distinct-digit count grows at a positive linear rate or at a prescribed sublinear rate are determined. The resulting dimension laws exhibit a sharp phase transition: imposing any positive linear rate forces the dimension to collapse to a value determined solely by the tail index, whereas under a broad class of sublinear growth rates, the exceptional sets retain full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two longest-run statistics are studied: the longest run of a fixed value and the longest run over all values. Under quantitative mixing and exponential cylinder estimates for constant words, a general theorem is proved. Quantitative almost-sure logarithmic growth is obtained, and eventual two-sided bounds with double-logarithmic error terms are established. For continued-fraction partial quotients, explicit centring constants and double-logarithmic error bounds are derived for both statistics.</description>

      <title>What is a Fluctuation Theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book provides a modern review of Fluctuation Relations and Fluctuation Theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. It focuses on the pioneering perspectives of Gallavotti and Cohen, according to which a fluctuation theorem describes the statistics of the deviations of entropy production from its expected value. For time-reversal invariant systems, these fluctuations obey a universal (i.e., model-independent) symmetry called the fluctuation relation. The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of random representations of free products of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the polynomial method of Chen--Garza-Vargas--Tropp--van Handel and Magee--Puder--van Handel for operator-norm bounds in random permutation models to the setting where torsion is present. The main new feature is that asymptotic expansion of traces naturally involves fractional powers of $N$ rather than an ordinary Laurent series. We formulate fractional-power analogues of the method's key hypotheses and prove they lead to strong convergence. We verify these analogues for free products of finite groups $\Gamma=G_1*\cdots*G_m$. Concretely, for a uniformly random $\phi_N\in{\rm hom}(\Gamma,{\rm Sym}(N))$, set $\pi_N = {\rm std} \circ \phi_N$, where ${\rm std}$ denotes the standard $(N-1)$-dimensional representation of ${\rm Sym}(N)$ (the permutation representation with the trivial subrepresentation removed). We deduce strong convergence of $\pi_N$ to the left regular representation of $\Gamma$. As applications, we obtain asymptotically sharp spectral gaps for the associated random Schreier graphs, including almost Ramanujan behavior for $C_2*C_2*C_2$ and an explicit non-Ramanujan limiting spectral radius for $C_2*C_3 \cong {\rm PSL}_2({\bf Z})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When sampling multi-modal probability distributions, correctly estimating the relative probability of each mode, even when the modes have been discovered and locally sampled, remains challenging. We test a simple reweighting scheme designed for this situation, which consists in minimizing (in terms of weights) the Kullback-Leibler divergence of a weighted (regularized) empirical distribution of the samples with respect to the target measure.</description>

      <title>Contention Resolution, With and Without a Global Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Contention Resolution problem $n$ parties each wish to have exclusive use of a shared resource for one unit of time. The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\left(\left(n\log\log n\log^{(3)} n\log^{(4)} n\cdots \log^{(\log^* n)} n\right)\cdot 2^{\log^* n}\right) \le n(\log\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $\Theta(n \log n/\log\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $\Theta(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Derivation of the Degenerate Parabolic-Elliptic Keller-Segel System from a Moderately Interacting Stochastic Particle System. Part II Propagation of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a series of two articles. The main goal is to rigorously derive the degenerate parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in the sub-critical regime from a moderately interacting stochastic particle system. In the first article [7], we establish the classical solution theory of the degenerate parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system and its non-local version. In the second article, which is the current one, we derive a propagation of chaos result, where the classical solution theory obtained in the first article is used to derive required estimates for the particle system. Due to the degeneracy of the non-linear diffusion and the singular aggregation effect in the system, we perform an approximation of the stochastic particle system by using a cut-offed interacting potential. An additional linear diffusion on the particle level is used as a parabolic regularization of the system. We present the propagation of chaos result with logarithmic scalings. Consequently, the propagation of chaos follows directly from convergence in the sense of expectation and the vanishing viscosity argument of the Keller-Segel system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed ledgers, including blockchain and other decentralized databases, are designed to store information online where all trusted network members can update the data with transparency. The dynamics of ledger's development can be mathematically represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this paper, we study a DAG model which considers batch arrivals and random delay of attachment. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of this model by letting the arrival rate go to infinity and the inter-arrival time go to zero. We establish that the number of leaves in the DAG and various random variables characterizing the vertices in the DAG can be approximated by its fluid limit, represented as the solution to a set of delayed partial differential equations. Furthermore, we establish the stable state of this fluid limit and validate our findings through simulations.</description>

      <title>Large-scale distributed synchronization systems, using a cancel-on-completion redundancy mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent distributed synchronization systems, which are modeled as $n$ particles moving on the real line. This class generalizes the model of a multi-server queueing system, considered in [15], employing so-called cancel-on-completion (c.o.c.) redundancy mechanism, but is motivated by other applications as well. The model in [15] is a particle system, regulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is such that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no regulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the number of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job arrival rates per particle remain constant. The system state for a given $n$ is the empirical distribution of the particles' locations. The results include: the existence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe the limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic independence (concentration of the stationary distribution on a single ML fixed point); the limits of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system advances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and generalize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical approach is such that the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of the phase transition for constrained-degree percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constrained-degree percolation on the hypercubic lattice. Initially, all edges are closed, and each edge independently attempts to open at a uniformly distributed random time; the attempt succeeds if, at that instant, both end-vertices have degrees strictly less than a prescribed parameter. The absence of the FKG inequality and the finite energy property, as well as the infinite range of dependency, make the rigorous analysis of the model particularly challenging. In this work, we show that the one-arm probability exhibits exponential decay in its entire subcritical phase. The proof relies on the Duminil-Copin--Raoufi--Tassion randomized algorithm method and resolves a problem of dos Santos and the second author. At the heart of the argument lies an intricate combinatorial transformation of pivotality in the spirit of Aizenman--Grimmett essential enhancements, but with unbounded range. This technique may be of use in other dynamical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean time taken by an irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space to hit a target chosen at random according to the stationary distribution does not depend on the initial state of the chain. This mean time is known as Kemeny's constant. I present a new approach, based on time reversal and a mean occupation time formula.
  The method is used to prove an analogous result for continuous-time Markov processes. We also present a second approach, based on work of N.~Eisenbaum and H.~Kaspi, when all states are regular.
  Examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Non-negative diffusion bridge of the McKean-Vlasov type: analysis of singular diffusion and application to fish migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide a new mathematical tool for fish migration that has not been studied well. McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) have broad potential applications in science and engineering, but remain insufficiently explored. We consider a non-negative McKean-Vlasov diffusion bridge, a diffusion process pinned at both initial and terminal times, motivated by diurnal fish migration phenomena. This type of MVSDEs has not been previously studied. Our particular focus is on a singular diffusion coefficient that blows up at the terminal time, which plays a role in applications of the proposed MVSDE to real fish migration data. We prove that the well-posedness of the MVSDE depends critically on the strength of the singularity in the diffusion coefficient. We present a sufficient condition under which the MVSDE admits a unique strong solution that is continuous and non-negative. We also apply the MVSDE to the latest fine fish count data with a 10-min time interval collected from 2023 to 2025 and computationally investigate these models. Thus, this study contributes to the formulation of a new non-negative diffusion bridge along with an application study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a singular stochastic equation driven by a regular noise of fractional Brownian type with Hurst index $H \in (1,\infty)\setminus\mathbb{Z}$ and drift coefficient $b \in \mathcal{C}^\alpha$, where $\alpha &gt; 1 - \frac{1}{2H}$. The strong well-posedness of this equation was first established in [Ger23], a phenomenon referred to as regularization by regular noise. In this note, we provide a corresponding numerical analysis. Specifically, we show that the Euler-Maruyama approximation $X^n$ converges strongly to the unique solution $X$ with rate $n^{-1}$. Furthermore, under the additional assumption $b \in \mathcal{C}^1$, we show that $n(X - X^n)$ converges to a non-trivial limit as $n \to \infty$, thereby confirming that the rate $n^{-1}$ is in fact optimal upper bound for this scheme.</description>

      <title>A mixed fractional CIR model: positivity and an implicit Euler scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) type short rate model driven by a mixed fractional Brownian motion. Let $M=B+B^H$ be a one-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&gt;1/2$, and let $\mathbf{M}=(M,\mathbb{M}^{\mathrm{It\hat{o}}})$ denote its canonical It\^o rough path lift. We study the rough differential equation \begin{equation}\label{eqn1} \dd r_t = k(\theta-r_t)\,\dd t + \sigma\sqrt{r_t}\,\dd\mathbf{M}_t,\qquad r_0&gt;0, \end{equation} and prove that, under the Feller condition $2k\theta&gt;\sigma^2$, the unique rough path solution is almost surely strictly positive for all times. The proof relies on an It\^o type formula for rough paths, together with refined pathwise estimates for the mixed fractional Brownian motion, including L\'evy's modulus of continuity for the Brownian part and a law of the iterated logarithm for the fractional component. As a consequence, the positivity property of the classical CIR model extends to this non-Markovian rough path setting. We also establish the convergence of an implicit Euler scheme for the associated singular equation obtained by a square-root transformation.</description>

      <title>On a Roll Again: Analysis of a Dice Removal Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we have $n$ dice, each with $s$ faces (assume $s\geq n$). On the first turn, roll all of them, and remove from play those that rolled an $n$. Roll all of the remaining dice. In general, if at a certain turn you are left with $k$ dice, roll all of them and remove from play those that rolled a $k$. The game ends when you are left with no dice to roll. For $n,s \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $s \geq n$, let $Y_n^s$ be the random variable for the number of turns to finish the game rolling $n$ dice with $s$ faces. We find recursive and non-recursive solutions for $\mathbb{E}(Y_n^{s})$ and $\mathrm{Var}(Y_n^{s})$, and bounds for both values. Moreover, we show that $Y_n^{s}$ can also be modeled as the maximum of a sequence of i.i.d. geometrically distributed random variables. Although, as far as we know, this game hasn't been studied before, similar problems have.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for Bipartite Latent-Space Graphs under Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information-theoretic phase transitions for the detectability of latent geometry in bipartite random geometric graphs RGGs with Gaussian d-dimensional latent vectors while only a subset of edges carries latent information determined by a random mask with i.i.d. Bern(q) entries. For any fixed edge density p in (0,1) we determine essentially tight thresholds for this problem as a function of d and q. Our results show that the detection problem is substantially easier if the mask is known upfront compared to the case where the mask is hidden.
  Our analysis is built upon a novel Fourier-analytic framework for bounding signed subgraph counts in Gaussian random geometric graphs that exploits cancellations which arise after approximating characteristic functions by an appropriate power series. The resulting bounds are applicable to much larger subgraphs than considered in previous work which enables tight information-theoretic bounds, while the bounds considered in previous works only lead to lower bounds from the lens of low-degree polynomials. As a consequence we identify the optimal information-theoretic thresholds and rule out computational-statistical gaps. Our bounds further improve upon the bounds on Fourier coefficients of random geometric graphs recently given by Bangachev and Bresler [STOC'24] in the dense, bipartite case. The techniques also extend to sparser and non-bipartite settings, at least if the considered subgraphs are sufficiently small. We furhter believe that they might help resolve open questions for related detection problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) for entropy production in chaotic discrete-time dynamical systems on compact metric spaces, and extend it to empirical measures, all continuous potentials, and all weak Gibbs states. In particular, we establish the FT in the phase transition regime. These results hold under minimal chaoticity assumptions (expansiveness and specification) and require no ergodicity conditions. They are also valid for systems that are not necessarily invertible and involutions other than time reversal. Further extensions involve asymptotically additive potential sequences and the corresponding weak Gibbs measures. The generality of these results allows to view the FT as a structural facet of the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear regression has been thoroughly studied in the context of independent and identically distributed data. We propose to investigate high-dimensional regression models for independent but non-identically distributed data. To this end, we suppose that the set of observed predictors (or features) is a random matrix with a variance profile and with dimensions growing at a proportional rate. Assuming a random effect model, we study the predictive risk of the ridge estimator for linear regression with such a variance profile. In this setting, we provide deterministic equivalents of this risk and of the degree of freedom of the ridge estimator. For certain class of variance profile, our work highlights the emergence of the well-known double descent phenomenon in high-dimensional regression for the minimum norm least-squares estimator when the ridge regularization parameter goes to zero. We also exhibit variance profiles for which the shape of this predictive risk differs from double descent. The proofs of our results are based on tools from random matrix theory in the presence of a variance profile that have not been considered so far to study regression models. Numerical experiments are provided to show the accuracy of the aforementioned deterministic equivalents on the computation of the predictive risk of ridge regression. We also investigate the similarities and differences that exist with the standard setting of independent and identically distributed data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the expected shortfall risk of a financial loss using a finite number of i.i.d. data. It is well known that the classical plug-in estimator suffers from poor statistical performance when faced with (heavy-tailed) distributions that are commonly used in financial contexts. Further, it lacks robustness, as the modification of even a single data point can cause a significant distortion. We propose a novel procedure for the estimation of the expected shortfall and prove that it recovers the best possible statistical properties (dictated by the central limit theorem) under minimal assumptions and for all finite numbers of data. Further, this estimator is adversarially robust: even if a (small) proportion of the data is maliciously modified, the procedure continuous to optimally estimate the true expected shortfall risk. We demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the classical plug-in estimator through a variety of numerical experiments across a range of standard loss distributions.</description>

We develop the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and establish its connection to the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on the Wasserstein space. The presence of the conditional joint law and its discontinuity under Poissonian common noise bring new technical challenges. To develop the SMP when the control domain is not necessarily convex, we first consider a strong relaxed control formulation that allows us to perform the first-order variation. We propose the technique of extension transformation to overcome the compatibility issues arising from the joint law in the relaxed control formulation. By further establishing the equivalence between the relaxed control and the strict control formulations, we obtain the SMP for the original problem with strict controls. In the part to investigate the HJB equation, we formulate an equivalent controlled Fokker-Planck problem subjecting to a controlled measure-valued dynamics with Poisson jumps, which allows us to derive the HJB equation of the original problem under open-loop strict controls. We also establish the connection between the SMP and the HJB equation.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Orthogonally Constrained Problems Using Semidefinite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson (1995) for the Max-Cut problem, we construct a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems. First, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and propose a randomized rounding algorithm to generate feasible solutions from the relaxation. Second, we derive purely multiplicative approximation guarantees for our algorithm. When optimizing for $m$ orthogonal vectors in dimension $n$, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance ratio of at least $\max\left\{\tfrac{2}{\pi m}, \tfrac{1}{\pi(\log (2m)+1)}\right\}$. Our analysis is tight in the sense that we exhibit instances where our algorithm's performance is at most $O(1/\log m)$. We also show how to compute a tighter constant for finite $(n,m)$ by solving a univariate optimization problem, and this analysis is exact for any $n$ when $m=1$.</description>

      <title>DistillKac: Few-Step Image Generation via Damped Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</description>

      <title>Distributional Computational Graphs: Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph). We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph.</description>

      <title>Card guessing after an asymmetric riffle shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is riffle-shuffled exactly one time. Given a value $p\in(0{,}1)\setminus\{\frac12\}$, the riffle shuffle is assumed to be unbalanced, such that the cut is expected to happen at position $p\cdot n$. The goal of the game is to maximize the number of correct guesses of the cards: one after another a single card is drawn from the top, and shown to the guesser until no cards remain. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal guessing strategy and study the distribution of the number of correct guesses.</description>
