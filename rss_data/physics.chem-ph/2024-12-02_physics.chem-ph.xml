      <title>Low-Temperature Synthesis of Weakly Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbyne, a one-dimensional (1D) carbon allotrope with alternating triple and single bonds, has the highest known mechanical strength but is unstable to bending, limiting synthesis to short linear chains. Encapsulation within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stabilizes carbyne, forming confined carbyne (CC), thus enabling further research concerning attractive 1D physics and materials properties of carbyne. While CC has been synthesized in multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) using the arc-discharge method and in double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) via high-temperature high-vacuum (HTHV) method, synthesis in single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) has been challenging due to their fragility under such conditions. In this work, we report a low-temperature method to synthesize CC inside SWCNTs (CC@SWCNT). By annealing SWCNTs containing ammonium deoxycholate (ADC) at 400{\deg}C, ADC is converted into CC without damaging the SWCNTs. Raman spectroscopy revealed a strong CC phonon (CC-mode) peak at 1860-1870 cm^-1, much stronger than the SWCNT G-band peak, confirming a high fraction of CC in the resulting material. The Raman mapping result showed the uniformity of the CC-mode signal across the entire film sample, proving the high efficiency of this method in synthesizing CC in every SWCNT of appropriate size. Notably, the CC-mode peaks of CC@SWCNT (above 1860 cm^-1) are higher than those reported in previous CC@CNT samples (mostly less than 1856 cm^-1). This is attributed to larger SWCNT diameters (over 0.95 nm) used in this study, compared to the typical 0.6-0.8 nm range. Larger diameters result in reduced confinement, allowing carbyne to closely resemble free-standing carbyne while remaining stabilized. This low-temperature synthesis of long-chain, nearly free-standing carbyne within large-diameter SWCNTs offers new opportunities for exploring 1D physics and the unique properties of carbyne for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Framework for Retrosynthesis Prediction with Enhanced Reaction Center Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis is essential for designing synthetic pathways for complex molecules and can be revolutionized by AI to automate and accelerate chemical synthesis planning for drug discovery and materials science. Here, we propose a hierarchical framework for retrosynthesis prediction that systematically integrates reaction center identification, action prediction, and termination decision into a unified pipeline. Leveraging a molecular encoder pretrained with contrastive learning, the model captures both atom and bond level representations, enabling accurate identification of reaction centers and prediction of chemical actions. The framework addresses the scarcity of multiple reaction center data through augmentation strategies, enhancing the ability of the model to generalize to diverse reaction scenarios. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance across benchmark datasets, with notably high topk accuracy and exceptional reaction center identification capabilities, demonstrating its robustness in handling complex transformations. These advancements position the framework as a promising tool for future applications in material design and drug discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are a highly promising alternative to force-fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, offering precise and rapid energy and force calculations. However, Quantum-Mechanical (QM) datasets, crucial for MLIPs, are fragmented across various repositories, hindering accessibility and model development. We introduce the openQDC package, consolidating 37 QM datasets from over 250 quantum methods and 400 million geometries into a single, accessible resource. These datasets are meticulously preprocessed, and standardized for MLIP training, covering a wide range of chemical elements and interactions relevant in organic chemistry. OpenQDC includes tools for normalization and integration, easily accessible via Python. Experiments with well-known architectures like SchNet, TorchMD-Net, and DimeNet reveal challenges for those architectures and constitute a leaderboard to accelerate benchmarking and guide novel algorithms development. Continuously adding datasets to OpenQDC will democratize QM dataset access, foster more collaboration and innovation, enhance MLIP development, and support their adoption in the MD field.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Potential with Multi-Resolution Approach Enables Accurate Prediction of Reaction Free Energies in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present design and implementation of a novel neural network potential (NNP) and its combination with an electrostatic embedding scheme, commonly used within the context of hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. Substitution of a computationally expensive QM Hamiltonian by a NNP with the same accuracy largely reduces the computational cost and enables efficient sampling in prospective MD simulations, the main limitation faced by traditional QM/MM set-ups. The model relies on the recently introduced anisotropic message passing (AMP) formalism to compute atomic interactions and encode symmetries found in QM systems. AMP is shown to be highly efficient in terms of both data and computational costs, and can be readily scaled to sample systems involving more than 350 solute and 40'000 solvent atoms for hundreds of nanoseconds using umbrella sampling. The performance and broad applicability of our approach are showcased by calculating the free-energy surface of alanine dipeptide, the preferred ligation states of nickel phosphine complexes, and dissociation free energies of charged pyridine and quinoline dimers. Results with this ML/MM approach show excellent agreement with experimental data. In contrast, free energies calculated with static high-level QM calculations paired with implicit solvent models or QM/MM MD simulations using cheaper semi-empirical methods show up to ten times higher deviation from the experimental ground truth and sometimes even fail to reproduce qualitative trends.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrational Dynamics on Bosonic Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Singlet fission contributes to solar energy harvesting in photosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF), the spin-allowed conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, offers a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. However, realising this potential necessitates materials capable of ultrafast (sub-picosecond) SF and the generation of long-lived (&gt; microsecond) triplet excitons, a synthetic challenge. Some photosynthetic organisms have evolved sophisticated molecular architectures that demonstrate these criteria, but despite 40 years of study, the underlying SF mechanisms and its functional significance in these organisms remain unclear. Here, we use a suite of ultrafast and magneto-optical spectroscopic techniques to understand the mechanism of SF within light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complexes from wild-type and genetically modified photosynthetic bacteria. Our findings reveal a SF process, termed "heterofission", wherein singlet excitons are transformed into triplet excitons localised on adjacent carotenoid (Crt) and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. We also uncover an unexpected functional role for SF in augmenting Crt-to-BChl photosynthetic energy transfer efficiency. By transiently storing electronic excitation within the SF-generated triplet pair, the system circumvents rapid thermalisation of Crt excitations, thereby enhancing energy transfer efficiency to the BChl Qy state, and enabling the organism to usefully harvest more sunlight.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Sum Frequency Generation for Molecular Vibrational Nanospectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) is a nonlinear spectroscopic technique widely used to study the molecular structure and dynamics of surface systems. However, the spatial resolution achieved by far-field observations is constrained by the diffraction limit, obscuring molecular details in inhomogeneous structures smaller than the wavelength of light. To overcome this limitation, we developed a system for tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectroscopy based on a scanning tunneling microscope. We successfully detected vibrational TE-SFG signals from adsorbed molecules on a gold substrate under ambient conditions. The phase analysis of interferometric SFG spectra provided information on molecular orientation. Furthermore, the observed TE-SFG signal was confirmed to originate from a highly localized region within a gap between the tip apex and the sample substrate. This method offers a novel platform for nonlinear optical nanospectroscopy, paving the way for the investigation of surface molecular systems beyond the diffraction limit.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for GWP Prediction: A Framework Using PCA, Quantile Transformation, and Ensemble Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing environmentally sustainable refrigerants is critical for mitigating the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global warming. This study presents a predictive modeling framework to estimate the 100-year global warming potential (GWP 100) of single-component refrigerants using a fully connected neural network implemented on the Multi-Sigma platform. Molecular descriptors from RDKit, Mordred, and alvaDesc were utilized to capture various chemical features. The RDKit-based model achieved the best performance, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 481.9 and an R2 score of 0.918, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and quantile transformation were applied to address the high-dimensional and skewed nature of the dataset,enhancing model stability and performance. Factor analysis identified vital molecular features, including molecular weight, lipophilicity, and functional groups, such as nitriles and allylic oxides, as significant contributors to GWP values. These insights provide actionable guidance for designing environmentally sustainable refrigerants. Integrating RDKit descriptors with Multi-Sigma's framework, which includes PCA, quantile transformation, and neural networks, provides a scalable solution for the rapid virtual screening of low-GWP refrigerants. This approach can potentially accelerate the identification of eco-friendly alternatives, directly contributing to climate mitigation by enabling the design of next-generation refrigerants aligned with global sustainability objectives.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Salt Effects on Ionic Conductivity Mechanisms in Ethylene Carbonate Electrolytes: Interplay of Viscosity and Ion-ion Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate role of shear viscosity and ion-pair relaxations on ionic conductivity mechanisms and the underlying changes induced by salt concentration ($c$) in organic liquid electrolytes remain poorly understood despite their widespread technological importance. Using molecular dynamics simulations employing nonpolarizable force fields for $c$ ranging between 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^1$ M, we show that the low and high $c$ regimes of the EC-LiTFSI electrolytes are distinctly characterized by $\eta\sim\tau_c^{1/2}$ and $\eta\sim\tau_c^{1}$, where $\eta$ and $\tau_c$ are shear viscosity and cation-anion relaxation timescales, respectively. Our extensive simulations and analyses suggest a universal relationship between the ionic conductivity and $c$ as $\sigma(c)\sim c^{\alpha}e^{-c/c_{0}} (\alpha&gt;0)$. The proposed relationship convincingly explains the ionic conductivity over a wide range of $c$, where the term $c^\alpha$ accounts for the uncorrelated motion of ions and $e^{-c/c_0}$ captures the salt-induced changes in shear viscosity. Our simulations suggest vehicular mechanism to be dominant at low $c$ regime which transitions into a structural diffusion mechanism at high $c$ regime, where structural relaxation is the dominant form of ion transport mechanism. Our findings shed light on some of the fundamental aspects of the ion conductivity mechanisms in liquid electrolytes, offering insights into optimizing the ion transport in EC-LiTFSI electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Hydrogen Atom Scattering Experiments Are Not a Sufficient Benchmark to Validate Electronic Friction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamics of atoms and molecules at metal surfaces, electron-hole pair excitations can play a crucial role. In the case of hyperthermal hydrogen atom scattering, they lead to nonadiabatic energy loss and highly inelastic scattering. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations where friction is computed under an isotropic homogeneous electron gas approximation have previously shown good agreement with measured kinetic energy loss distributions, suggesting that this level of theoretical description is sufficient to describe nonadiabatic effects of atomic scattering. In this work, we show that similar agreement with room temperature experiments can also be achieved with friction derived from density functional theory linear response calculations. The apparent agreement of the homogeneous electron gas approximation with experiment arises from a fortuitous cancellation of errors where friction is overestimated close to the surface and the spin transition is neglected. Only for scattering at low temperatures can both approximations be distinguished and differences rationalised in terms of the number of bounces of the atom on the surface. We identify the signatures of nonadiabatic energy loss of different levels of theory, which future low-temperature scattering experiments will be able to measure.</description>

      <title>How to correct Ehrenfest nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems: Ehrenfest plus random force (E$+$$\sigma$) dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One key challenge in the study of nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems is to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Although Ehrenfest dynamics (ED) is computationally efficient and well-suited for large complex systems, ED often yields inaccurate results. To address these limitations, we improve the accuracy of the traditional ED by adding a random force (E$+$$\sigma$). In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E$+$$\sigma$ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, E$+$$\sigma$ model still retains the high efficiency of the ED and does not incur much additional computation. We believe that this method provides an alternative to accurately describe mixed quantum-classical dynamics in open quantum systems, particularly for large complex systems.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>
