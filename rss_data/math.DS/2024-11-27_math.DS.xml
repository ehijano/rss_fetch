      <title>Concentration of dimension in the Lagrange spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a smooth conservative diffeomorphism of a compact surface $S$ and let $\Lambda$ be a mixing horseshoe of $\varphi$. Given a smooth real function $f$ defined on $S$, we define for points $\eta$ in the unstable Cantor set of the pair $(\varphi,\Lambda)$, a generalization, $k_{\varphi,\Lambda,f}(\eta)$, of the best constant of Diophantine approximation for irrational numbers. We study the set of points $\eta$ for which the sets $k_{\varphi,\Lambda,f}^{-1}((-\infty,\eta])$ and $k_{\varphi,\Lambda,f}^{-1}(\eta)$ have the same Hausdorff dimension and when the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda$ is less than one, we describe generically the local Hausdorff dimension of the dynamical Lagrange spectrum, $\mathcal{L}_{\varphi,\Lambda,f}$, restricted to this set of points. Finally, we recover the same results for the classical Lagrange spectra.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of gasket Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The object of the paper is to characterize gasket Julia sets of rational maps that can be uniformized by round gaskets. We restrict to rational maps without critical points on the Julia set. Under these conditions, we prove that a Julia set can be quasiconformally uniformized by a round gasket if and only if it is a fat gasket, i.e., boundaries of Fatou components intersect tangentially. We also prove that a Julia set can be uniformized by a round gasket with a David homeomorphism if and only if every Fatou component is a quasidisk; equivalently, there are no parabolic cycles of multiplicity 2. Our theorem applies to show that gasket Julia sets and limit sets of Kleinian groups can be locally quasiconformally homeomorphic, although globally this is conjectured to be false.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we study the generalized $q$-dimensions of measures supported by nonautonomous attractors, which are the generalization of classic Moran sets and attractors of iterated function systems.
  First, we estimate the generalized $q$-dimensions of measures supported on nonautonomous attractors, and we provide dimension formulas for generalized $q$-dimensions of measures supported on nonautonomous similar attractor under certain separation conditions. Next, we investigate the generalized $q$-dimensions of measures supported on nonautonomous affine sets and obtain the upper bounds. Finally, we study two variations of nonautonomous affine sets and obtain their dimension formulas for $q\geq 1 $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimization problems in ergodic theory from the view point of minimax problems. We give minimax characterizations of maximum ergodic averages involving time averages. Our approach works for the abstract variational principle of generalized pressure functions which is proved by Bi\'{s} et al. (2022). We also describe the relationship between our minimax results and the Fenchel-Rockafellar duality.</description>

      <title>Bistability and chaos in the discrete two-gene Andrecut-Kauffman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct numerical analysis of the 2-dimensional discrete-time gene expression model originally introduced by Andrecut and Kauffman (Phys. Lett. A 367: 281-287, 2007). In contrast to the previous studies, we analyze the dynamics with different reaction rates $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ for each of the two genes under consideration. We explore bifurcation diagrams for the system with $\alpha_1$ varying in a wide range and $\alpha_2$ fixed. We detect chaotic dynamics by means of a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent and we scan through selected parameters to detect those combinations for which chaotic dynamics can be found in the system. Moreover, we find bistability in the model, that is, the existence of two disjoint attractors. Both situations are interesting from the point of view of applications, as they imply unpredictability of the system. Finally, we show some specific values of parameters of the model in which the two attractors are of different kind (a periodic orbit and a chaotic attractor) or of the same kind (two periodic orbits or two chaotic attractors).</description>

      <title>Strengthening Power System Resilience to Extreme Weather Events Through Grid Enhancing Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change significantly increases risks to power systems, exacerbating issues such as aging infrastructure, evolving regulations, cybersecurity threats, and fluctuating demand. This paper focuses on the utilization of Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to strengthen power system resilience in the face of extreme weather events. GETs are pivotal in optimizing energy distribution, enabling predictive maintenance, ensuring reliable electricity supply, facilitating renewable energy integration, and automating responses to power instabilities and outages. Drawing insights from resilience theory, the paper reviews recent grid resilience literature, highlighting increasing vulnerabilities due to severe weather events. It demonstrates how GETs are crucial in optimizing smart grid operations, thereby not only mitigating climate-related impacts but also promoting industrial transformation.

      <title>Strong convergence and fast rates for systems with Tikhonov regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectories of a second order dynamical system with Tikhonov regularization for solving a monotone equation with single valued, monotone and continuous operator acting on a real Hilbert space. We consider a vanishing damping which is correlated with the Tikhonov parameter and which is in line with recent developments in the literature on this topic. A correction term which involves the time derivative of the operator along the trajectory is also involved in the system and makes the link with Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt type methods. We obtain strong convergence of the trajectory to the minimal norm solution and fast convergence rates for the velocity and a quantity involving the operator along the trajectory. The rates are very closed to the known fast convergence results for systems without Tikhonov regularization, the novelty with respect to this is that we also obtain strong convergence of the trajectory to the minimal norm solution. As an application we introduce a primal-dual dynamical system for solving linearly constrained convex optimization problems, where the strong convergence of the trajectories is highlighted together with fast convergence rates for the feasibility measure and function values.</description>

      <title>On the affine invariant of hypersemitoric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypersemitoric systems are a class of integrable systems on $4$-dimensional symplectic manifolds which only have mildly degenerate singularities and where one of the integrals induces an effective Hamiltonian $S^1$-action and is proper. We introduce the affine invariant of hypersemitoric systems, which is a generalization of the Delzant polytope of toric systems and the polytope invariant of semitoric systems. Along the way, we compute and plot this invariant for meaningful and more and more complicated examples.</description>

      <title>Analytic weak-stable manifolds in unfoldings of saddle-nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any attracting, hyperbolic and proper node of a two-dimensional analytic vector-field has a unique strong-stable manifold. This manifold is analytic. The corresponding weak-stable manifolds are, on the other hand, not unique, but in the nonresonant case there is a unique weak-stable manifold that is analytic. As the system approaches a saddle-node (under parameter variation), a sequence of resonances (of increasing order) occur. In this paper, we give a detailed description of the analytic weak-stable manifolds during this process. In particular, we relate a ``flapping-mechanism'', corresponding to a dramatic change of the position of the analytic weak-stable manifold as the parameter passes through the infinitely many resonances, to the lack of analyticity of the center manifold at the saddle-node. Our work is motivated and inspired by the work of Merle, Rapha\"{e}l, Rodnianski, and
  Szeftel, where this flapping mechanism is the crucial ingredient in the construction of $C^\infty$-smooth self-similar solutions of the compressible Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of integral points, equivariant compactifications and equidistributions for homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let U be a homogeneous variety over Q of a linear algebraic group. Choose an integral model and assume the existence of infinitely many integral points. Then one would like to give an asymptotic count of integral points of bounded height with the help of some height function. In many cases, with the help of measure rigidity of unipotent flows, we reduce this problem to one on equivariant birational geometry. For instance, we show that if G and H are both connected, semisimple, simply connected and without compact factors, then G/H is strongly Hardy-Littlewood with respect to some height function. We also show that when H is ``large'' in G and both G and H are connected, reductive and without nontrivial Q-characters, the asymptotic of integral points is the same as the volume asymptotic up to a constant for every equivariant height. Three concrete examples with explicit heights are also provided to illustrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing and sparse equidistribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem asserts that, for an ergodic map, orbits of almost every point equidistributes when sampled at integer times. This result was generalized by Bourgain to many natural sparse subsets of the integers. On the other hand, the behaviour of orbits of \textbf{all} points in a dynamical system is much less understood, especially for sparse subsets of the integers. We generalize a method introduced by A. Venkatesh to tackle this problem in two directions, general $\mathbb{R}^d$ actions instead of flows, and weak mixing, rather than mixing, actions. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of weak mixing and show weak mixing for the time 1-map of a weak mixing flow. The main examples are equidistribution along $\{(n^{1+\epsilon_i})_{i=1}^d\}$, which is a direct generalisation of Venkatesh's example, and equidistribution along random subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for horosperical action.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>The Poset of Cancellations in a Filtered Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by questions about simplification and topology optimization, we take a discrete approach toward the dependency of topology simplifying operations and the reachability of perfect Morse functions. Representing the function by a filter on a Lefschetz complex, and its (non-essential) topological features by the pairing of its cells via persistence, we simplify using combinatorially defined cancellations. The main new concept is the depth poset on these pairs, whose linear extensions are schedules of cancellations that trim the Lefschetz complex to its essential homology. One such linear extensions is the cancellation of the pairs in the order of their persistence. An algorithm that constructs the depth poset in two passes of standard matrix reduction is given and proven correct.</description>

      <title>On Temporal Decay of Compressible Hookean Viscoelastic Fluids with Relatively Large Elasticity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jiang--Jiang (J. Differential Equations 282, 2021) showed the existence of unique strong solutions in spatial periodic domain (denoted by $\mathbb{T}^3$), whenever the elasticity coefficient is larger than the initial velocity perturbation of the rest state. Motivated by Jiang--Jiang's result, we revisit the Cauchy problem of the compressible viscoelastic fluids in Lagrangian coordinates. Employing an energy method with temporal weights and an additional asymptotic stability condition of initial density in Lagrangian coordinates, we extend the Jiang--Jiang's result with exponential decay-in-time in $\mathbb{T}^3$ to the one with algebraic decay-in-time in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Thanks to the algebraic decay of solutions established by the energy method with temporal weights, we can further use the spectral analysis to improve the temporal decay rate of solutions. In particular, we find that the $k$-th order spatial derivatives of both the density and deformation perturbations converge to zero in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ at a rate of $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k+1}{2}}$, which is faster than the decay rate $(1 +t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ obtained by Hu--Wu (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 45, 2013) for $k=0$ and $ 1$. In addition, it's well-known that the decay rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ of the density perturbation is optimal in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations (A.~Matsumura, T.~Nishida, Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser-A. 55, 1979). Therefore, our faster temporal decay rates indicate that the elasticity accelerates the decay of the density perturbation after the rest state of a compressible viscoelastic fluid being perturbed.</description>
