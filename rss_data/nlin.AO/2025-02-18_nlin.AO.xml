      <title>Multistability and Control in Ring Networks of Phase Oscillators with Frequency Heterogeneity and Phase Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many oscillator networks are multistable, meaning that different synchronization states are realized depending on the initial conditions. In this paper, we numerically analyze a ring network of phase oscillators, in which synchronous states with different wavenumbers are simultaneously stable. This model is an extension of the one studied in detail in previous studies by introducing inhomogeneities in the natural frequencies and the phase delay in the interaction, which are essential factors in the application. We investigate basin size distribution, which characterizes the size of the initial value set that converges to each synchronous state, showing that the basin size of synchronous states with higher wave-numbers broadens as the phase delay increases up to a certain extent. Weak inhomogeneities in the natural frequencies are also found to broaden the basin size of synchronous states with lower wave-numbers, i.e., more synchronous states. The latter result is seemingly counter-intuitive, but occurs because the higher wavenumber states are more vulnerable to inhomogeneity. Finally, we propose a control method that exploits inhomogeneity and phase delay to steer the system into a synchronized state with a specific wavenumber. This research furthers our understanding of the design principles and control of oscillator networks.</description>

      <title>Emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity: Homeostatic maintenance of criticality and memory consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike digital computers, the brain exhibits spontaneous activity even during complete rest, despite the evolutionary pressure for energy efficiency. Inspired by the critical brain hypothesis, which proposes that the brain operates optimally near a critical point of phase transition in the dynamics of neural networks to improve computational efficiency, we postulate that spontaneous activity plays a homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of criticality. Criticality in the brain is associated with the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (EI balance), which is essential for maintaining neural computation performance. Here, we hypothesize that both criticality and EI balance are stabilized by appropriate noise levels and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) windows. Using spiking neural network (SNN) simulations and in vitro experiments with dissociated neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that while repetitive stimuli transiently disrupt both criticality and EI balance, spontaneous activity can develop and maintain these properties and prolong the fading memory of past stimuli. Our findings suggest that the brain may achieve self-optimization and memory consolidation as emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity. This noise-harnessing mechanism provides insights for designing energy-efficient neural networks, and may explain the critical function of sleep in maintaining homeostasis and consolidating memory.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>
