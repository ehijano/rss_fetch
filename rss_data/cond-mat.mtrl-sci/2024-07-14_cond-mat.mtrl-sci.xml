      <title>Electronically-driven switching of topology in LaSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, various classes of topological materials have been discovered, spanning topological insulators, semimetals, and metals. While the observation and understanding of the topology of a material has been a primary focus so far, the precise and easy control of topology in a single material remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate full experimental control over the topological Dirac nodal loop in the square-net material LaSb$_\mathrm{x}$Te$_\mathrm{2-x}$ by chemical substitution and electron doping. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we show that changing the antimony concentration x from 0.9 to 1.0 in the bulk opens a gap as large as 400 meV in the nodal loop. Our symmetry analysis based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction and a minimal tight binding model establishes that the breaking of \textit{n} glide symmetry in the square-net layer is responsible for the opening of the gap. Remarkably, we can also realize this topological phase transition \textit{in situ} on the surface of LaSb$_\mathrm{x}$Te$_\mathrm{2-x}$ by chemical gating using potassium deposition, which enables the reversible switching of the topology from gapped to gapless nodal loop. The underlying control parameter for the structural and topological transition in the bulk and on the surface is the electron concentration. It opens a pathway towards applications in devices based on switching topology by electrostatic gating.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of the crystal structures from three-dimensional real-space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure detection from the real-space analysis only is still a big challenge in multiple disciplines due to the absence of exact analytical or computational methods. New types of complex crystal structures seek more involvement of advanced techniques and understandings as well as developing new kinds of machinery. Despite the existence of proper experimental techniques of crystal structure detection, it lacks the exact approach to obtain the complete unit cell information from the three dimensional coordinates only. In this research, we propose an exact prescription to detect the crystal structures in real-space based on the arrangements of the local environment and by searching for the directions of possible translational vectors. The protocol yields good agreements with the experimental results for any simple or complex crystal structures irrespective of the single-component or multi-component systems allowing the complete execution to take a minimal time and computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithmic prescription can be applied to detect the unit cell of crystal structure and identify the space group across the domains of condensed matter physics and material sciences.</description>

      <title>High throughput screening, crystal structure prediction, and carrier mobility calculations of organic molecular semiconductors as hole transport layer materials in perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a representative translational dimer model, high throughput calculations are implemented for fast screening of a total of 74 diacenaphtho-extended heterocycle (DAH) derivatives as hole transport layer (HTL) materials in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Different electronic properties, including band structures, band gaps, and band edges compared to methylammonium and formamidinium lead iodide perovskites, along with reorganization energies, electronic couplings, and hole mobilities are calculated in order to decipher the effects of different parameters, including the polarity, steric and pi-conjugation, as well as the presence of explicit hydrogen bond interactions on the computed carrier mobilities of the studied materials. Full crystal structure predictions and hole mobility calculations of the top candidates resulted in some mobilities exceeding 10 cm2/V.s, further validating the employed translational dimer model as a robust approach for inverse design and fast high throughput screening of new HTL organic semiconductors with superior properties. The studied models and simulations performed in this work are instructive in designing next-generation HTL materials for higher-performance PVSCs.</description>

      <title>Understanding chiral charge-density wave by frozen chiral phonon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) is discovered within a wide interval in solids, however, its microscopic nature is still not transparent in most realistic materials, and the recently studied chiral ones with chiral structural distortion remain unclear. In this paper, we try to understand the driving forces of chiral CDW transition by chiral phonons from the electron-phonon coupling scenario. We use the prototypal monolayer 1T-TiSe$_2$ as a case study to unveil the absence of chirality in the CDW transition and propose a general approach, i.e., symmetry-breaking stimuli, to engineer the chirality of CDW in experiments. Inelastic scattering patterns are also studied as a benchmark of chiral CDW (CCDW, which breaks the mirror/inversion symmetry in 2D/3D systems). We notice that the anisotropy changing of Bragg peak profiles, which is contributed by the soft chiral phonons, can show a remarkable signature for CCDW. Our findings pave a path to understanding the CCDW from the chiral phonon perspective, especially in van der Waals materials, and provide a powerful way to manipulate the chirality of CDW.</description>

      <title>Coupling multi-space topologies in 2D ferromagnetic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology can manifest topological magnetism (e.g., skyrmion and bimeron) in real space and quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state in momentum space, which have changed the modern conceptions of matter phase. While the topologies in different spaces are widely studied separately, their coexistence and coupling in single phase is seldomly explored. Here, we report a novel phenomenon that arises from the interaction of topological magnetism and band topology, the multi-space topology, in 2D ferromagnetic lattice. Based on continuum theory and tight-binding model, we reveal that the interconnection between skyrmion/bimeron and QAH state generates distinctive localized chiral bound states (CBSs). With moderating topological magnetism through magnetic field, the multi-space topologies accompanied with different CBSs can be reversed, facilitating the coupling of multi-space topologies. By performing firstprinciples and atomic spin model simulations, we further demonstrate such multi-space topologies and their coupling in monolayer Cr2NSb. These results represent an important step towards the development of multispace topological phenomena in 2D lattice.</description>

      <title>Origin and properties of the flat band in NbOCl2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a flat band near the Fermi level can be a suitable platform for the emergence of interesting phenomena in condensed matter physics. Recently, NbOCl2 monolayer has been experimentally synthesized [Nature 613 (2023) 53], which has a flat and isolated valence band. We show that monolayers based on other elements of group 5 of the periodic table, including the V and Ta atoms, also have a flat band. Motivated by the recent experiment, we investigate the origin of the flat band as well as the electronic, optical, photocatalytic, and magnetic properties of the monolayer by combining density functional theory and many-body quantum perturbation theory. Our results show that the flat and isolated band of this monolayer is caused by the interplay between the Peierls distortion and the electronic configuration of Nb atoms. The investigation of the bandwidth of the monolayer under the biaxial and uniaxial strains reveals that this material can be grown on substrates with a larger lattice constant by maintaining the flat band.
  Examining the material's response to the linearly polarized light not only reveals the presence of weak optical anisotropy, but also shows the existence of a bright exciton with a binding energy of about 0.94 eV. Hole doping can result in a flat band-induced phase transition from semiconductor to ferromagnet. By adjusting the amount of doping, a bipolar magnetic semiconductor or a half-metal can be created. The interaction between the nearest Nb atoms is ferromagnetic, while an antiferromagnetic interaction appears between the second neighbors, which grows significantly with increasing doping. Our results demonstrate that NbOCl2 monolayer has suitable potential for spintronic applications in addition to electronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Crossed real nodal-line phonons in gold monobromide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime inversion symmetry can generate intriguing types of spinless excitations in crystalline materials. Here, we propose a topological phase protected by spacetime inversion symmetry - the crossed real nodal line (RNL) in the phonon spectrum of gold monobromide (AuBr). In AuBr, there exist four straight nodal lines, which are linked by a crossed nodal line formed by two lower bands. Remarkably, each adjacent two of the four straight nodal lines is a pair, forming a crossed RNL with nontrivial real Chern number. Such configuration and pairing mode of RNL have never been reported. The crossed RNL exhibits unique surface and hinge states distinguished from that of the conventional RNLs. The symmetry protection and the transformation under the symmetry-preserving strain of the crossed RNL are also investigated. Our results open the door to a new class of topological states, and predict its realization in experimentally synthesized material.</description>

      <title>Topological Fermi-arc surface state covered by floating electrons on a two-dimensional electride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electrides can acquire topologically non-trivial phases due to intriguing interplay between the cationic atomic layers and anionic electron layers. However, experimental evidence of topological surface states has yet to be verified. Here, via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we probe the magnetic Weyl states of the ferromagnetic electride $[Gd_{2}$C]^{2+}\cdot2e^{-}$. In particular, the presence of Weyl cones and Fermi-arc states is demonstrated through photon energy-dependent ARPES measurements, agreeing with theoretical band structure calculations. Notably, the STM measurements reveal that the Fermi-arc states exist underneath a floating quantum electron liquid on the top Gd layer, forming double-stacked surface states in a heterostructure. Our work thus not only unveils the non-trivial topology of the $[Gd_{2}$C]^{2+}\cdot2e^{-}$ electride but also realizes a surface heterostructure that can host phenomena distinct from the bulk.</description>

      <title>First principles calculations of dynamical Born effective charges, quadrupoles and higher order terms from the charge response in large semiconducting and metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of first principles techniques we present a theoretical and computational framework to quickly determine, at finite momentum, the self-consistent (longitudinal) charge response to an external perturbation, that enters the determination of the scattering cross section of inelastic scattering processes such as EELS. We also determine the (tranverse) charge response computed in short-circuit condition. The all-order quasimomentum expansion of the tranverse charge response to an atomic displacement are the Born effective charges, quadrupoles, octupoles etc. We demonstrate that the transverse charge response can be related to the longitudinal one via a well-defined long-range dielectric function. Our advancements lead to an efficient use of perturbation theory. Due to its more favorable scaling, our method provides an interesting computational alternative to the use of the 2n+1 theorem, especially for semiconductors and metals with large unit cells. For semiconductors, we compute the piezoelectric properties of a large cell solid-solution of semiconducting hafniun oxide containing 96 atoms. We here show that the clamped ion piezoelectric response can be decomposed into real-space localized contributions that mostly depend on the chemical environment, paving the way for the use of machine-learning techniques in the material search for optimized piezoelectrics. We further apply our methodology to determine the density response of metals. Here, the leading terms of the charge expansion are related to the Fermi energy shift of the potential and by Born effective charges which do not sum to zero over the atoms. We apply our developments to the TEM-EELS spectroscopy of lithium intercalated graphites, where we find that the use of the atomic form-factor in the long-wavelength limit does not take into account for the anisotropy of the atomic chemical bonding.</description>

      <title>Conductive metal oxide and hafnium oxide bilayer ReRAM: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform generalized gradient approximation (GGA) simulations of interfaces between two Conductive Metal-Oxides (CMO, namely TaO and TiO) and cubic hafnium oxide ($HfO_2$) in the context of bilayer Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) devices. We simulate filamentary conduction in $HfO_2$ by creating an atomically thin O atom vacancy path inside $HfO_2$. We show that this atomically thin filament leads to a great reduction of the resistance of the structures. Moreover, we explore the possibility of the influence of O excess inside the CMO on the global resistance of the device and confirm the induced modulation. We also shed the light on two possible causes for the observed increas in the resistance when O atoms are inserted inside the CMO. Eventually, we push forward key differences between devices with TaO and TiO as CMO. We show that structures with TaO are more stable in general and lead to a behaviour implying only low and high resistance (two well separated levels) while structures with TiO allows for intermediate resistances.</description>

      <title>In-situ Analysis of the Effect of Residual fcc Phase and Special Grain Boundaries on the Deformation Dynamics in Pure Cobalt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline hcp metals - an important class of engineering materials - typically exhibit complex plasticity because of a limited number of slip systems. Among these metals, deformation is even more complicated in cobalt as it commonly contains residual fcc phase due to the incomplete martensitic fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation upon cooling. In this work, we employ a combination of in-situ (acoustic emission, AE) and ex-situ (scanning electron microscopy, SEM) techniques in order to examine deformation dynamics in pure polycrystalline cobalt varying in grain size and the content of residual fcc phase prepared using systematic thermal treatment and cycling. We reveal that the presence of the fcc phase and special ~71{\deg} grain boundaries between different hcp martensite variants brings about higher deformability and strength. The fcc phase provides additional slip systems and also accommodates deformation via the stress-induced fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation during loading. On the other hand, special boundaries enhance structural integrity and suppress the formation of critical defects. Both these non-trivial effects can dominate over the influence of grain size, being a traditional microstructural variable. The ex-situ SEM experiments further reveal that the stress-induced fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation is sluggish and only partial even at high strains, and it does not give rise to detectable AE signals, unlike in other materials exhibiting martensitic transformation. In turn, these insights into cobalt plasticity provide new avenues for the microstructure and performance optimization towards the desired applications through the modern concept of grain boundary engineering.</description>

      <title>Bonding states underpinning structural transitions in IrTe$_2$ observed with micro-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing interactions in low-dimensional materials can produce nearly degenerate electronic and structural phases. We investigate the staircase of structural phase transitions in layered IrTe$_2$ for which a number of potential transition mechanisms have been postulated. The spatial coexistence of multiple phases on the micron scale has prevented a detailed analysis of the electronic structure. By exploiting micro-ARPES obtained with synchrotron radiation we extract the electronic structure of the multiple structural phases in IrTe$_2$ in order to address the mechanism underlying the phase transitions. We find direct evidence of lowered energy states that appear in the low-temperature phases, states previously predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and extended here. Our results validate a proposed scenario of bonding and anti-bonding states as the driver of the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries control lithiation of solid solution substrates in lithium metal batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of sustainable transportation and communication systems requires an increase in both energy density and capacity retention of Li-batteries. Using substrates forming a solid solution with body centered cubic Li enhances the cycle stability of anode-less batteries. However, it remains unclear how the substrate microstructure affects the lithiation behavior. Here, we deploy a correlative, near-atomic scale probing approach through combined ion- and electron-microscopy to examine the distribution of Li in Li-Ag diffusion couples as model system. We reveal that Li regions with over 93.8% at.% nucleate within Ag at random high angle grain boundaries, whereas grain interiors are not lithiated. We evidence the role of kinetics and mechanical constraint from the microstructure over equilibrium thermodynamics in dictating the lithiation process. The findings suggest that grain size and grain boundary character are critical to enhance the electrochemical performance of interlayers/electrodes, particularly for improving lithiation kinetics and hence reducing dendrite formation.</description>

      <title>Ground-state properties of the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trillium lattices formed by corner-shared triangular units are the platform for magnetic frustration in three dimensions. Herein, we report structural and magnetic properties of the Cr-based double trillium lattice material KBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ studied by x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements complemented by density-functional band-structure calculations. Heat capacity and $^{31}$P NMR measurements reveal the magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 13.5$ K in zero field followed by another transition at $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 7$ K in weak applied fields. The NMR sublattice magnetization confirms that the transition at $T_{\rm N1}$ is 3D in nature. The $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate in the ordered state follows the $T^3$ behavior indicative of the two-magnon Raman process. The spin lattice of KBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ comprises two crystallographically nonequivalent ferromagnetic sublattices that are coupled antiferromagnetically, thus eliminating frustration in this trillium network.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations compared to ferromagnetic spintronics and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have required millimeter-scale samples to achieve measurable signals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in devices 1000 times smaller using spin-filter tunneling in micron-scale PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromaget CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance provides the means to make detailed studies of the physics governing these high-frequency dynamics and to pursue applications including radiation sources, modulators, and detectors.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear electrical conduction primarily mediated by an orbital texture is observed in chiral semiconductor Te. We determine the enantiospecific sign of the nonlinear conductance and identify anomalies in its carrier-density dependence. Our findings, combined with the Boltzmann equation, are attributed to a chiral orbital texture, namely a chiral distribution of the orbital magnetic moment in reciprocal space. This study underscores the efficacy of nonlinear transport measurements in probing orbital-related effects, whose differentiation from spin counterparts is often demanding in the linear response regime of electron transport.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Single CdSe Magic-Sized Nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical syntheses that provide nanocrystals (NCs) with narrow distributions in size and shape are critical for NC research. This has led to the investigation of magic-sized NCs (MSNCs), a class of semiconductor crystallites that grow in discrete steps, potentially offering a single size and shape (i.e., monodispersity). However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe MSNCs measured at room temperature have been reported to be broader than those of state-of-the-art quantum dots. This difference could be due to the smaller size of MSNCs, which broadens their line widths, or due to their residual size dispersity. To better understand the optical performance of MSNCs, here we perform single-particle spectroscopy. Our results show that, while CdSe MSNCs do exhibit particle-to-particle variations that lead to modest broadening of their ensemble emission spectra, the largest contribution comes from the single-particle line width. By examining MSNCs with different sizes and shells, we conclude that this single-particle broadening is consistent with exciton coupling to acoustic phonons from the NC surface. Because of their small size, this coupling and the role of residual size dispersity have a larger impact on the ensemble emission line widths. Notably, when small (&lt;2.7 nm diameter) MSNCs and quantum dots are compared, the ensemble PL line widths of MSNCs are actually sharper. Due to their small size, MSNCs also exhibit strong anti-bunching $[g^{(2)}(0) \sim 0.05]$ at room temperature. Thus, MSNCs represent a bright, spectrally pure class of quantum emitter, useful for applications in optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies where strong three-dimensional confinement is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit ferroelectricity, making them promising for novel non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a well-known vdW ferroelectric that has been integrated with graphene for memory devices. Here we demonstrate FeDs with self-rectifying, hysteretic current-voltage characteristics based on vertical heterostructures of 10-nm-thick CIPS and graphene. By using vdW indium-cobalt top electrodes and graphene bottom electrodes, we achieve high electroresistance (on- and off-state resistance ratios) of ~10^6, on-state rectification ratios of ~2500 for read/write voltages of 2 V/0.5 V and maximum output current densities of 100 A/cm^2. These metrics compare favourably with state-of-the-art FeDs. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements show that stabilization of intermediate net polarization states in CIPS leads to stable multi-bit data retention at room temperature. The combination of two-terminal design, multi-bit memory, and low-power operation in CIPS-based FeDs is potentially interesting for compute-in-memory and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and field-induced phenomena in the Jeff = 1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Identification and Statistical Analysis of Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are layered two-dimensional semiconductors explored for various optoelectronic applications, ranging from light-emitting diodes to single-photon emitters. To interact strongly with light, such devices require monolayer TMDs, which exhibit a direct bandgap. These atomically thin sheets are typically obtained through mechanical exfoliation followed by manual identification with a brightfield optical microscope. While this traditional procedure provides high-quality crystals, the identification step is time-intensive, low-throughput, and prone to human error, creating a significant bottleneck for TMD research. Here, we report a simple and fully automated approach for high-throughput identification of TMD monolayers using photoluminescence microscopy. Compared to a manual search and verification, our methodology offers a four-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the time a researcher must invest per identified monolayer. This ability enables us to measure geometric and photoluminescence-intensity features of more than 2,400 monolayers and bilayers of WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$. Due to these large numbers, we can study and quantify material properties previously inaccessible. For example, we show that the mean photoluminescence intensity from a monolayer correlates with its size due to reduced emission from its edges. Further, we observe large variations in brightness (up to 10$\times$) from WSe$_2$ monolayers of different batches produced by the same supplier. Therefore, our automated approach not only increases fabrication efficiency but also enhances sample quality for optoelectronic devices of atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional ferromagnetic nanodot structures exhibit intriguing magnetization dynamics and hold promise for future magnonic devices. In this study, we present a comparative experimental investigation into the reconfigurable magnetization dynamics of non-ellipsoidal diamond and triangular-shaped nanodot structures, employing broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the spin wave (SW) spectra of these structures under different bias field strengths (H) and angles ({\phi}). Notably, the diamond nanodot structure exhibits a variation from nearly symmetric W-shaped dispersion to a skewed dispersion and subsequent transition to a discontinuous dispersion with subtle variation in bias field angle. On the other hand, in the triangular nanodot array a SW mode anti-crossing appears at {\phi} = 15{\deg} which is starkly modified with the increase in {\phi} to 30{\deg}. By analyzing the static magnetic configurations, we unveil the nature of the SW spectra in these two shapes. We reinforce our observations with simulated spatial power and phase maps. This study underscores the critical impact of dot shape and inversion symmetry on SW dynamical response, highlighting the significance of selecting appropriate structures and bias field strength and orientation for required functionalities. The remarkable tunability demonstrated by the magnonic crystals underscores their potential suitability for future magnonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a side entry laser system designed for an ultra-high vacuum scanning transmission electron microscope. This system uses a versatile probe design enclosed in a vacuum envelope such that parts can be easily aligned, modified, or exchanged without disturbing the vacuum. The system uses a mirror mounted on the sample holder such that the sample can be illuminated without being tilted. Notably the mirror can be removed and replaced with an ablation target and a higher power laser used to ablate material directly onto the sample. We argue that new capabilities hold the potential to transform the electron microscope from an analysis tool towards a more flexible synthesis system, where atomic scale fabrication and atom-by-atom experiments can be performed.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectrics are of practical interest for non-volatile data storage due to their reorientable, crystallographically defined polarization. Yet efforts to integrate conventional ferroelectrics into ultrathin memories have been frustrated by film-thickness limitations, which impede polarization reversal under low applied voltage. Wurtzite materials, including magnesium-substituted zinc oxide (Zn,Mg)O, have been shown to exhibit scalable ferroelectricity as thin films. In this work, we explain the origins of ferroelectricity in (Zn,Mg)O, showing that large strain fluctuations emerge locally in (Zn,Mg)O and can reduce local barriers to ferroelectric switching by more than 40%. We provide concurrent experimental and computational evidence of these effects by demonstrating polarization switching in ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O/ZnO heterostructures featuring built-in interfacial strain gradients. These results open up an avenue to develop scalable ferroelectrics by controlling strain fluctuations atomistically.</description>

Abstract: The application of semiconductors with optical properties has grown significantly in the development of semiconductor photovoltaics. Here, we explore the electronic and optical properties of ternary transition metal sulfide Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_4$ by means of density functional theory. From the structural perspective, Ni atoms are found to form a kagome-like lattice in a two-dimensional plane of Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_4$.
  From our calculations, Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_4$ is found to be a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of $\sim$0.67 eV. Strong hybridization was observed between the S-3\textit{p} with the Ni-3$d_{xz}$ and Ni-3$d_{yz}$ orbitals. Interestingly, a flat band was noticed below the Fermi level demonstrating one significant feature of kagome lattice. From the optical calculations, Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_4$ is found to exhibit optical activity in both the visible and lower ultraviolet regions of the incident photon energies. The optical response suggests this material may be a potential candidate for opto-electronic device, given its ability to interact with light across a broad range of wavelengths. This work is expected to motivate the experimental group for transport measurements and may provide a new foundation in optics.</description>

Abstract: Accurate identification of ice phases is essential for understanding various physicochemical phenomena. However, such classification for structures simulated with molecular dynamics is complicated by the complex symmetries of ice polymorphs and thermal fluctuations. For this purpose, both traditional order parameters and data-driven machine learning approaches have been employed, but they often rely on expert intuition, specific geometric information, or large training datasets. In this work, we present an unsupervised phase classification framework that combines a score-based denoiser model with a subsequent model-free classification method to accurately identify ice phases. The denoiser model is trained on perturbed synthetic data of ideal reference structures, eliminating the need for large datasets and labeling efforts. The classification step utilizes the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors as the atomic fingerprint, ensuring Euclidean symmetries and transferability to various structural systems. Our approach achieves a remarkable 100\% accuracy in distinguishing ice phases of test trajectories using only seven ideal reference structures of ice phases as model inputs. This demonstrates the generalizability of the score-based denoiser model in facilitating phase identification for complex molecular systems. The proposed classification strategy can be broadly applied to investigate structural evolution and phase identification for a wide range of materials, offering new insights into the fundamental understanding of water and other complex systems.</description>

Abstract: Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) exhibit intriguing optical properties and exceptional performance in (photo)catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Nevertheless, the intricate phenomena involving light absorption extending to the visible range, long-lived excitons, photo-charging, and photochemical processes observed in PCN derivatives remain poorly understood. Our theoretical investigation elucidates the origin of distinct dark and bright excitons, their stability and lifetimes, and their correlation with the microstructural attributes of PCNs. Furthermore, we identified the decisive role of dark excitons in catalytic reactivity.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a new mechanism to exert control over the macroscopic properties of quantum materials toward novel functionality. To date, technological applications of these non-thermal phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and low-ordering temperatures. Among the most studied photoinduced metastable phases for their technological promise is the hidden metallic charge density wave (H-CDW) in the model correlated CDW compound 1$T$-TaS$_2$. Despite active study and engineering, the nature of the photoinduced H-CDW remains the subject of debate and is only accessible at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we stabilize the H-CDW phase at thermal equilibrium up to near-room temperature by accessing an intermediate mixed CDW order regime via thermal quenching. Using x-ray high dynamic range reciprocal space mapping (HDRM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we reveal the coexistence of commensurate (C) CDW and H-CDW domains below 180 K during cooling and below 210 K during warming. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the H-CDW phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states at zero bias observed via STS, bulk resistance remains insulating due to CDW stacking disorder. This study establishes the H-CDW as a thermally stable phase and introduces a new mechanism for switchable metallic behavior in thin flakes of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and similar materials with competing order phases.</description>

Abstract: Micro-mechanics of parachute fabrics under tensile loads is studied using in situ X-ray micro-tomography. Results are presented for two nylon textiles commonly used in parachute systems, MIL-C-7020H Type III and MIL-C-44378(GL) Type II. Textiles are subjected to incremental tension using a custom apparatus that loads the fabric radially, and the microstructure is imaged sequentially at steady load conditions. Micro-tomography images are processed using learning-aided segmentation and a custom processing pipeline that tracks the locations and morphological properties of individual tows on 3-D datasets. Results are used to reconstruct tow micro-scale properties and meso-scale strains. Our findings reveal a direct relation between the fabric architecture and the meso-scale mechanics. Warp tow pretensioning during manufacturing is found to affect decrimping and the anisotropy of the textile strains. Areal porosity increase with tension is quantified and a geometric model for pore opening under incremental load is validated.</description>

Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity and Topology in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as an exciting platform for investigating the effects of strong electronic correlations, including various forms of magnetic or electrical orders. Here, we perform an unbiased exact diagonalization study of the effects of interactions on topological flat bands of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at odd integer fillings. For hole-filling $\nu_h = 1$, we find that Chern insulator phases, expected from interaction-induced spin-valley polarization of the bare bands, are quite fragile, and give way to spontaneous multiferroic order -- coexisting ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, in presence of long-range Coulomb repulsion. We provide a simple real-space picture to understand the phase diagram as a function of interaction range and strength. Our findings establish twisted TMDs as a novel and highly tunable platform for multiferroicity, and we outline a potential route towards electrical control of magnetism in the multiferroic phase.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular separations of a binary mixture under van der Waals confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the dynamics of a binary mixture confined within van der Waals (vdW) walls using molecular dynamics simulations. We discovered a novel phenomenon named perpendicular separations of two phases (PSTP). In the initial stage, central water molecules diffused, subsequently condensing symmetrically within the confinement's mid-plane. In the later stage, as water droplets nucleate and grow, the resin separates perpendicularly into two films due to the action of bubblers and vdW walls, resulting in a hollow nanochannel. The mechanisms and conditions underlying PSTS are discussed. The results indicate that the concentration (C) of resin in the middle region is linearly decreased with temporal power. We propose a new mechanism for stabilizing nanochannels and films: dynamic "soft pillars" that prevent Rayleigh-like instability. Our findings could shed light on the manufacture of nanofilms and organic nanochannels, which could help advance bio-detection and energy fields.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Convexity of Nonlinear Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW method inspired, basis set for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis, Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals combined with LO or lo orbitals.</description>
