      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>Effect of hole pitch reduction on electron transport and diffusion: A comparative simulation study of Triple GEM detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in fabrication techniques and high-performance electronics have facilitated the development of fine-pitch Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs). Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $\mu$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $\mu$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors.</description>

      <title>A compact Optical Liquid Argon Facility at Roma Tre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a compact test facility for the measurement of optical properties of liquid argon as scintillation detector. The setup is under preparation at Roma Tre and it has a volume of 40 L liquid argon, which is liquefied from argon gas with a purity of $\ge 99.9999\%$ vol. To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu. By submerging the photon detectors directly inside the liquid argon, we can eliminate the systematics from the wave length shifter and light guides which have been commonly used to detect the scintillation photons of liquid argon.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Electrostatic Dodecapole: Compact Bandpass Filter with Low Aberrations for Momentum Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging energy filters in photoelectron microscopes and momentum microscopes use spherical fields with deflection angles of 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and even 2 x 180{\deg}. These instruments are optimized for high energy resolution, but exhibit image aberrations when operated in high transmission mode at medium energy resolution. Here we present a new approach for bandpass-filtered imaging in real or reciprocal space using an electrostatic dodecapole with an asymmetric electrode array. In addition to energy-dispersive beam deflection, this multipole allows aberration correction up to the 3rd order. Here we describe its use as a bandpass prefilter in a time-of-flight momentum microscope at the hard X-ray beamline P22 of PETRA III. The entire instrument is housed in a straight vacuum tube because the deflection angle is only 4{\deg} and the beam displacement in the filter is only 8 mm. The multipole is framed by transfer lenses in the entrance and exit branches. Two sets of 16 different sized entrance and exit apertures on piezomotor driven mounts allow selection of the desired bandpass. For pass energies between 100 and 1400 eV and slit widths between 0.5 and 4 mm the transmitted kinetic energy intervals are between 10 eV and a few hundred eV (FWHM). The filter eliminates all higher or lower energy signals outside the selected bandpass, significantly improving the signal-to-background ratio in the ToF analyzer.</description>

      <title>CycleGAN-Driven Transfer Learning for Electronics Response Emulation in High-Purity Germanium Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay (\ensuremath{0\nu\beta\beta}) and dark matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics, requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic Positional U-Net (https://github.com/aobol/CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this {Response Emulation Network} (REN) learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact (ICPC) geometry to show that \texttt{CPU-Net} effectively captures and reproduces critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without detector-specific tuning. \texttt{CPU-Net} achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape discrimination.</description>

      <title>Detection of ultracold neutrons with powdered scintillator screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag) scintillators coated with a thin 10B layer are widely used for ultracold neutron (UCN) detection, but their application is limited by long decay times and significant phosphorescence. We investigated two possible replacement scintillators: yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP:Ce) and lutetium ttrium orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce). Both exhibit decay times on the order of 30-40 ns, which can help reduce dead time in high-count-rate experiments. YAP:Ce showed approximately 60% lower phosphorescence than ZnS:Ag after 2 days and detected about 20% more UCN. In contrast, LYSO:Ce exhibited higher phosphorescence and produced fewer UCN counts compared to both ZnS:Ag and YAP:Ce. While both tested scintillators are capable UCN detectors, YAP:Ce consistently outperformed LYSO:Ce across all measured performance metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean transmission efficiency of the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer at TRIUMF has been measured with 6 different angular apertures at 17 kinetic energy/charge deviations with respect to the central, reference trajectory. Measurements performed using a 148Gd alpha source installed at the target position of the spectrometer are compared to ion-optical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The transmission efficiency as a function of angle and kinetic energy/charge is described empirically using piecewise Gaussian functions whose parameters are fit to the data.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
