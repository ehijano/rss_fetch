      <title>A Comprehensive Review on RNA Subcellular Localization Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17162</link>

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.</description>

      <title>Using mathematical models of heart cells to assess the safety of new pharmaceutical drugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide, at a cost of billions of dollars, because of patient fatalities due to them unexpectedly disturbing heart rhythm. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been withdrawn due to an unacceptable increase in risk of these heart rhythm disturbances. Consequently, the whole pharmaceutical industry expends a huge effort in checking all new drugs for any unwanted side effects on the heart. The predominant root cause has been identified as drug molecules blocking ionic current flows in the heart. Block of individual types of ionic currents can now be measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is the standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the degree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is difficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently. By using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of heart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from different types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and subsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more accurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more cheaply than the pre-existing approaches.</description>
