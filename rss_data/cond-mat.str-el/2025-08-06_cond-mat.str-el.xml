      <title>Longitudinal magnons in large-$S$ easy-axis magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal magnons are a novel class of multipolar quantum excitations in magnetic materials with large spins $S\ge 1$ and strong easy-axis anisotropy. These excitations have angular momentum $S^z = \pm 2S$ and can be viewed as propagating spin reversals. We study a simple model for longitudinal magnons: a square lattice of spins $S$ coupled by the neareast-neighbor exchange, ferro- or antiferromagnetic, in the presence of a single-ion anisotropy. We calculate the excitation spectra in the large-$D$ limit by using a strong-coupling expansion. In the specific case of $S=1$ we compare the results for several analytical approaches that include the linked-cluster expansion, the multiboson representation of spin operators, and also, for a ferromagnetic ground state, the exact solution of the two-particle bound states. Among these different approaches, the multiboson theory gives the decay rate of longitudinal magnons and describes the evolution of the excitation spectra from strong to moderate and weak anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Composite Fermion Theory of Fractional Chern Insulator Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the well-known trace condition emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit. Applied to twisted MoTe$_2$, the calculated CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved photoemission intensity for multi-orbital bands: Complex interplay between the self-energy matrix and the optical matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a simple one-dimensional two-band model with electron-phonon coupling to illustrate some of the complications that arise in multi-band systems when trying to extract a self-energy using the typical approach used for single-band systems when analyzing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. The underlying reason is that in multi-band models the self-energy is a matrix, not a scalar, and the result obtained from the ARPES analysis is a complicated function of all these self-energy matrix elements, weighted by different dipole matrix elements of the relevant Wannier orbitals. We contrast the results for Holstein and Peierls electron-phonon couplings to further illustrate differences between models with a local versus non-local self-energy matrix.</description>

      <title>Symmetric versus antisymmetric strain tuning of the valence transition in Yb(In$_{1-x}$Ag$_x$)Cu$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to transitions in a range of correlated quantum materials, the valence transition exhibits a strong coupling to the crystal lattice, rendering it highly sensitive to stress tuning. In the present work, we determine the effect of uniaxial stress, which breaks the lattice symmetry, on the valence transition temperature and its crossover temperature in pure and Ag-substituted YbInCu$_4$. Our key result is that hydrostatic stress is more effective in tuning this transition than uniaxial stress. Based on a symmetry decomposition of the stress-induced strains, we argue that this observation can be quantitatively understood, given that the valence transition is mostly sensitive to symmetric strains and thus volume changes of the lattice. These results support the notion that the valence transition can give rise to critical elasticity close to its critical endpoint.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of boron clusters in the infrared conductivity of heavy fermion metal CeB6 and unconventional superconductor ZrB12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity and permittivity spectra of the archetypal heavy fermion metal CeB6 and unconventional superconductor ZrB12 was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations were separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 was attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the boron complexes in CeB6 and ZrB12. It was shown that nonequilibrium electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and fraction of Drude-type electrons does not exceed 37% in CeB6 and 23% in ZrB12. We discuss also the additional Drude-type component in ZrB12 in terms of far-infrared conductivity from the sliding charge density wave, and suggest the localized mode scenario reconciles the strong difference between the number of conduction electrons obtained from the Hall effect and optical sum rule analysis in CeB6.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topological Mott insulators and deconfined quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.We also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</description>

      <title>Geometric fragmentation and anomalous thermalization in cubic dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum statistical mechanics triumphs in explaining many equilibrium phenomena, there is an increasing focus on going beyond conventional scenarios of thermalization. Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are either integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of translationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited energies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or emergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these investigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also generically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of athermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is subjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes in the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an interplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes exotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities. This causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical arguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in the linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify sectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The unitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different from the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of fermionic codes.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Raman probe of the photoinduced superconducting to normal state transition in the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an ultrafast Time-Resolved Raman scattering study of the out-of-equilibrium photoinduced dynamics across the superconducting to normal state phase transition of the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery with sub-ps resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of TR-Raman to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electron sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.</description>

      <title>Theory of circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in magnetic materials. We define RIXS-CD as the difference between scattering amplitudes for the right- and left-circularly polarized incoming photons and unpolarized (total) outgoing photons. We employ the impurity approximation, in which the interference between scattering events on different atoms is neglected. We perform the symmetry analysis of several common antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic structures and outline the general approach. The analysis is supported by numerical calculations using atomic model with realistic crystal fields obtained from first principles. We show that RIXS-CD is distinguished from first-order spectroscopies such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism by insensitivity to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. As a result we find that RIXS-CD is present in the normal (disordered) state of materials with lower symmetry. In antiferromagnets the RIXS-CD is invariant under N\'eel vector reversal. In altermagnets and ferromagnets the RIXS-CD spectra for time-reversed states are, in general, independent except for the special case when there is a unitary symmetry of the Hamiltonian connecting the</description>

      <title>Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Inelastic electron tunneling through adatoms and molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a theoretical description of the inelastic electron tunneling spectra (IETS) of a magnetic nanosystem (an atom or a molecule) adsorbed on a solid surface measured in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We represent the nanosystem by means of a cluster Hubbard model, which allows us to study scenarios when the tunneling electrons sequentially interact with several magnetic centers inside the nanosystem or when the magnetic centers are made out of heavy atoms with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large orbital moments. The sequential tunneling through multiple centers is illustrated on an adatom probed by an STM tip with a nickelocene molecule attached to it. For atoms with a large orbital moment, we find the transitions accessible by IETS to be governed by the selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 2\ell+1$, where $J_z$ is the projection of the total angular momentum of the atom to the quantization axis and $\ell$ is the orbital momentum quantum number of the partially filled atomic shell carrying the magnetic moment. For atoms with magnetic moments dominated by spin, the spectra are naturally dominated by transitions fulfilling the traditional selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Nature of field-induced transitions and hysteretic magnetoresistance in non-collinear antiferromagnet EuIn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction to compute the quantum double $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$ of a finite 2-group $\mathcal G$ as a Hopf monoidal category. We also construct a 3+1D lattice model from the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT functor for the 2-group $\mathcal G$, generalizing Kitaev's 2+1D quantum double model. Notably, the string-like local operators in this lattice model are shown to form $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$. Specializing to $\mathcal G = \mathbb{Z}_2$, we demonstrate that the topological defects in the 3+1D toric code model are modules over $\mathcal D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability in the nematic phase of two monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematicity, where electrons break rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry, is ubiquitous in strongly correlated quantum matters, including high-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors. A central question in nematicity is whether it is driven by Pomeranchuk instability in momentum space or orbital order (polarization) in real space, especially as nematicity intertwines with superconductivity. FeSe/SrTiO3 (STO), where nematicity occurs without long-range magnetic order, is an ideal platform for studying the nature and origin of the electronic nematicity. Here we present direct evidence of Pomeranchuk nematic order in two monolayer FeSe/STO using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable degeneracy of dxz and dyz bands at the Brillouin zone center, but a significant band separation at the zone corner. This momentum-dependent nematicity demonstrates that nematicity in FeSe/STO originates from the Pomeranchuk instability, offering insights into the relationship between nematicity and superconductivity. Our results establish two-dimensional FeSe thin film as a powerful platform for investigating quantum physics under complex intertwinement.</description>

      <title>Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of anomalous spin dynamics and weak magnetic order in a chiral trillium lattice K2FeSn(PO4)3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across $T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below $T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak \textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.</description>

      <title>From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy of flat bands in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals. On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been realized in very different material settings and chemical environments, preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features, indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1) site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1) site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice ordering as a key control parameter.</description>

      <title>Foundation Neural-Networks Quantum States as a Unified Ansatz for Multiple Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and (2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the ``weak-measurement altered criticality".</description>
