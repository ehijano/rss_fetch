      <title>Is your stochastic signal really detectable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a challenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding \textit{bayesian sensitivity curve}. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty estimation for time series classification: Exploring predictive uncertainty in transformer-based models for variable stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying variable stars is key for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. With the demands of large astronomical surveys, machine learning models, especially attention-based neural networks, have become the state-of-the-art. While achieving high accuracy is crucial, enhancing model interpretability and uncertainty estimation is equally important to ensure that insights are both reliable and comprehensible. We aim to enhance transformer-based models for classifying astronomical light curves by incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques to detect misclassified instances. We tested our methods on labeled datasets from MACHO, OGLE-III, and ATLAS, introducing a framework that significantly improves the reliability of automated classification for the next-generation surveys. We used Astromer, a transformer-based encoder designed for capturing representations of single-band light curves. We enhanced its capabilities by applying three methods for quantifying uncertainty: Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), Hierarchical Stochastic Attention (HSA), and a novel hybrid method combining both approaches, which we have named Hierarchical Attention with Monte Carlo Dropout (HA-MC Dropout). We compared these methods against a baseline of deep ensembles (DEs). To estimate uncertainty estimation scores for the misclassification task, we selected Sampled Maximum Probability (SMP), Probability Variance (PV), and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) as uncertainty estimates. In predictive performance tests, HA-MC Dropout outperforms the baseline, achieving macro F1-scores of 79.8+-0.5 on OGLE, 84+-1.3 on ATLAS, and 76.6+-1.8 on MACHO. When comparing the PV score values, the quality of uncertainty estimation by HA-MC Dropout surpasses that of all other methods, with improvements of 2.5+-2.3 for MACHO, 3.3+-2.1 for ATLAS and 8.5+-1.6 for OGLE-III.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Astronomy Data with Measurement Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers often deal with data where the covariates and the dependent variable are measured with heteroscedastic non-Gaussian error. For instance, while TESS and Kepler datasets provide a wealth of information, addressing the challenges of measurement errors and systematic biases is critical for extracting reliable scientific insights and improving machine learning models' performance. Although techniques have been developed for estimating regression parameters for these data, few techniques exist to construct prediction intervals with finite sample coverage guarantees. To address this issue, we tailor the conformal prediction approach to our application. We empirically demonstrate that this method gives finite sample control over Type I error probabilities under a variety of assumptions on the measurement errors in the observed data. Further, we demonstrate how the conformal prediction method could be used for constructing prediction intervals for unobserved exoplanet masses using established broken power-law relationships between masses and radii found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Summation of Arbitrary Masks -- ESAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for impulsive, astrophysical transients are often highly computationally demanding. A notable example is the dedispersion process required for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio telescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of Arbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many arbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands of dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the traditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We compare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM provides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational cost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB searches.</description>

      <title>Event-based Detectors for Laser Guide Star Tip-Tilt Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based sensors detect only changes in brightness across a scene, each pixel producing an asynchronous stream of spatial-temporal data, rather than recording frames of overall illumination like a traditional frame-based sensor. This is advantageous for implementing into a wavefront sensor, which benefits from high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. The determination of tip-tilt in particular is still a problem in laser guide star adaptive optics as there is no current technological capabilities to measure it. This study characterised the behaviour of an event-based sensor in the context of tip-tilt sensing,investigating if the high temporal resolution of the event streams could address these challenges. Different conditions of tip-tilt and background illumination levels are explored and found to be a strong contender for tip-tilt sensing with laser guide stars.</description>

      <title>Data analysis of the NISP instrument for the Euclid mission: from the first validation tests on ground up to the verification phase after launch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral on July 1st, 2023, is dedicated to studying dark matter and dark energy from its orbit at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. It is equipped with two instruments: the visual imager (VIS) and the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). The Euclid Wide Survey (Scaramella et al. 2022) will cover approximately 14500 deg2 of the extragalactic sky, and will be complemented by the Euclid Deep Survey that will cover about 40 deg2 and achieve two magnitudes fainter depth. Several ground-test campaigns were performed to assess NISP instrument basic functionalities and performances, some highlights will be reviewed in this thesis. The analysis comprises two key aspects: the evaluation of NISP image data acquired during ground-tests and during commissioning, and the verification of instrument performance in spectroscopic mode through the use of pixel-level simulated images. The analysis includes the characterisation of NISP detectors, from instrumental background to point-spread function (PSF) evaluations, confirming that NISP performance is well within the Euclid requirement. We introduce a calibration methodology to estimate the filter wheel assembly position from PSF distortions that have been successfully applied during the commissioning and will continue to be used during the mission for calibration purpose. Additionally, we investigated noise events that occur during image acquisition, with a particular focus on \v{S}snowballs\v{S} and cosmic ray tracks. Finally, we present a spectroscopic pixel-level simulation campaign of the NISP instrument, where spectral energy distributions were generated and processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Africanus I. Scalable, distributed and efficient radio data processing with Dask-MS and Codex Africanus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12052v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New radio interferometers such as MeerKAT, SKA, ngVLA, and DSA-2000 drive advancements in software for two key reasons. First, handling the vast data from these instruments requires subdivision and multi-node processing. Second, their improved sensitivity, achieved through better engineering and larger data volumes, demands new techniques to fully exploit it. This creates a critical challenge in radio astronomy software: pipelines must be optimized to process data efficiently, but unforeseen artefacts from increased sensitivity require ongoing development of new techniques. This leads to a trade-off among (1) performance, (2) flexibility, and (3) ease-of-development. Rigid designs often miss the full scope of the problem, while temporary research code is unsuitable for production. This work introduces a framework for developing radio astronomy techniques while balancing the above trade-offs. It prioritizes flexibility and ease-of-development alongside acceptable performance by leveraging Open Source data formats and software. To manage growing data volumes, data is distributed across multiple processors and nodes for parallel processing, utilizing HPC and cloud infrastructure. We present two Python libraries, Dask-MS and Codex Africanus, which enable distributed, high-performance radio astronomy software with Dask. Dask is a lightweight parallelization and distribution framework that integrates with the PyData ecosystem, addressing the "Big Data" challenges of radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>DarkNESS: developing a skipper-CCD instrument to search for Dark Matter from Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DarkNESS (Dark Matter Nano-satellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors) mission aims to deploy a skipper-CCD CubeSat Observatory to search for dark matter (DM) from Low Earth Orbit. This mission will employ novel skipper-CCDs to investigate O(keV) X-rays from decaying DM, as well as electron recoils from strongly-interacting sub-GeV DM. The DarkNESS mission will be the first space deployment of skipper-CCDs, and the DarkNESS team is developing a skipper-CCD instrument that is compatible with the CubeSat platform. DarkNESS has recently progressed from laboratory validation to a Critical Design Review (CDR) phase, with a launch opportunity anticipated in late 2025. The implementation of the DarkNESS skipper-CCD payload on the CubeSat platform will pave the way for future demonstrators of space-based imagers for X-ray and single-electron counting applications.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar-origin binary black holes in LISA Data Challenge 1b: Yorsh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first search for stellar-origin binary black holes within the LISA Data Challenges (LDC). The search algorithm and the Yorsh LDC datasets, both previously described elsewhere, are only summarized briefly; the primary focus here is to present the results of applying the search to the challenge of data. The search employs a hierarchical approach, leveraging semi-coherent matching of template waveforms to the data using a variable number of segments, combined with a particle swarm algorithm for parameter space exploration. The computational pipeline is accelerated using GPU hardware. The results of two searches using different models of the LISA response are presented. The most effective search finds all five sources in the data challenge with injected signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 12$. Rapid parameter estimation is performed for these sources.</description>

      <title>MOCKA -- A PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue: Simulations for gravity-mode oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With ESA's PLATO space mission set for launch in December 2026, a new photometric legacy and a future of new scientific discoveries await. In this work we investigate PLATO's potential for observing pulsating stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as part of the PLATO Complimentary Science program (PLATO-CS). Specifically, a PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue (MOCKA) of intermediate to massive stars is presented as a benchmark to highlight the asteroseismic yield of PLATO-CS in a quantitative way. MOCKA includes simulations of $\beta$~Cephei, slowly pulsating B (SPB), $\delta$~Scuti, $\gamma$~Doradus, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, hot subdwarf, and white dwarf stars. In particular, main-sequence gravity (g) mode pulsators are of interest as some of these stars form an important foundation for the scientific calibration of PLATO. MOCKA is based on a magnitude limited ($G\lesssim17$) \textit{Gaia} catalogue and is a product of realistic end-to-end \texttt{PlatoSim} simulations of stars for the first PLATO pointing field in the Southern hemisphere, which will be observed for a minimally 2-yr duration. We show that an abundant spectrum of frequencies is achievable across a wide range of magnitudes and co-pointing PLATO cameras. Within the magnitude limited regimes simulated ($G \lesssim 14$ for $\gamma$~Doradus stars and $G \lesssim 16$ for SPB stars) the dominant g-mode frequency is recovered in more than $95\%$ of the cases. MOCKA help us to understand the limits of the PLATO mission as well as highlight the opportunities to push astrophysics beyond current stellar models. All data products of this paper are made available to the community for further exploration. The key data products of MOCKA are the magnitude limited \textit{Gaia} catalogue of the first PLATO pointing field, together with fully reduced light curves from multi-camera observations for each pulsation class.</description>

      <title>Science Filter Characterization of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the Aditya-L1 mission is designed to observe the Sun across 200-400 nm wavelength. The telescope used 16 dichroic filters tuned at specific wavelengths in various combinations to achieve its science goals. For accurate measurements and interpretation, it is important to characterize these filters for spectral variations as a function of spatial location and tilt angle. Moreover, we also measured out-of-band and in-band transmission characteristics with respect to the inband transmissions. In this paper, we present the experimental setup, test methodology, and the analyzed results. Our findings reveal that the transmission properties of all filters meet the expected performance for spatial variation of transmission and the transmission band at a specific tilt angle. The out-of-band transmission for all filters is below 1% with respect to in-band, except for filters BB01 and NB01. These results confirm the capabilities of SUIT to effectively capture critical solar features in the anticipated layer of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise artefacts with optimised conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>cp3-bench: A tool for benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms tested with cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce cp3-bench, a tool for comparing symbolic regression algorithms which we make publicly available at https://github.com/CP3-Origins/cp3-bench. Currently, cp3-bench includes 12 symbolic regression algorithms which can be automatically installed as part of cp3-bench. The philosophy behind cp3-bench is that it should be as user-friendly as possible, available in a ready-to-use format, and allow for easy additions of new algorithms and datasets. Our hope is that users of symbolic regression algorithms can use cp3-bench to easily install and compare symbolic regression algorithms to better decide which algorithms to use for their specific tasks at hand. To introduce and motivate the use of cp3-bench we present a benchmark of 12 symbolic regression algorithms applied to 28 datasets representing six different astrophysical setups. Overall, we find that most of the benched algorithms do poorly in the benchmark and suggest possible ways to proceed with developing algorithms that will be better at identifying ground truth expressions for cosmological datasets. Our demonstration benchmark studies the significance of dimensionality of the feature space and precision of datasets. We find both to be highly important for symbolic regression tasks to be successful. On the other hand, we find no indication that inter-dependence of features in datasets is important, i.e. it is not in general a hindrance for symbolic regression algorithms if datasets e.g. contain both $z$ and $H(z)$ as features. Lastly, we find no indication that performance of algorithms on standardized datasets are good indicators of performance on particular astrophysical datasets. This suggests that it is not necessarily prudent to choose symbolic regression algorithms based on their performance on standardized data. A more robust approach is to consider a variety of algorithms, chosen based on the particular task at hand.</description>

      <title>Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA -- Uncertainty and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of the angular jitter of the spacecraft and their sub-assemblies with the optical bench and the telescope into the interferometric length readout will be a major noise source in the LISA mission. We refer to this noise as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. It will be reduced directly by realignments, and the residual noise will then be subtracted in post-processing. The success of these mitigation strategies depends on an accurate computation of the TTL coupling coefficients. We present here a thorough analysis of the accuracy of the coefficient estimation under different jitter characteristics, angular readout noise levels, and gravitational wave sources. We analyze in which cases the estimates degrade using two estimators, the common least squares estimator and the instrumental variables estimator. Our investigations show that angular readout noise leads to a bias of the least squares estimator, depending on the TTL coupling coefficients, jitter and readout noise level, while the instrumental variable estimator is not biased. We present an equation that predicts the estimation bias of the least squares method due to angular readout noise.</description>

      <title>ComPair-2: A Next Generation Medium Energy Gamma-ray Telescope Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems science themes require a gamma-ray mission with capabilities exceeding those of existing (e.g. Fermi, Swift) and planned (e.g. COSI) observatories. ComPair, the Compton Pair telescope, is a prototype of such a next-generation gamma-ray mission. It had its inaugural balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in August 2023. To continue the goals of the ComPair project to develop technologies that will enable a future gamma-ray mission, the next generation of ComPair (ComPair-2) will be upgraded to increase the sensitivity and low-energy transient capabilities of the instrument. These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain silicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This effort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity. Here we describe the ComPair-2 prototype design and integration and testing plans to advance the readiness level of these novel technologies.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary-lens perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.724 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.258 +/- 0.008 M_sun and M_2 = 0.130 +/- 0.007 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 6.83 +/- 0.31 au and a distance of D_L = 2.29 +/- 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few astronomical units) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Expanded Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (eGNILC) Framework for the 21-cm Foreground Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method is a non-parametric component separation algorithm to remove the foreground contamination of the 21-cm intensity mapping data. In this work, we perform the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along the frequency axis in the expanded GNILC framework (denoted eGNILC) which helps reduce the power loss in low multipoles, and further demonstrate its performance. We also calculate the eGNILC bias to modify the criterion for determining the degrees of freedom of the foreground (dof), and embed the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in mixing matrix computation to obtain a blind component separation method. We find that the eGNILC bias is related to the averaged domain size and the dof of the foreground but not the underlying 21-cm signal. In case of no beam effect, the eGNILC bias is negligible for simple power law foregrounds outside the Galactic plane. We also examine the eGNILC performance in the SKA-MID (SKA Phase-I in mid-frequency) and BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) simulations. We show that if the adjacent frequency channels are not highly correlated, eGNILC can recover the underlying 21-cm signal with good accuracy. With the varying Airy-disk beam applied to both SKA-MID and BINGO, the power spectra of 21-cm can be effectively recovered at the multipoles $\ell \in [20, 250]$ and $[20, 300]$ respectively. With no instrumental noise, the SKA-MID exhibits $\lesssim 20\%$ power loss and BINGO exhibits $\sim 10\%$ power loss. The varying Airy-disk beam only causes significant errors at large multipoles.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust, unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in physics.</description>
