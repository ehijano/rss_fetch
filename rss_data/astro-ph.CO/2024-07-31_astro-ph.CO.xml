      <title>Stage IV baryonic feedback correction for non-Gaussianity inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian statistics of the projected weak lensing field are powerful estimators that can outperform the constraining power of the two-point functions in inferring cosmological parameters. This is because these estimators extract the non-Gaussian information contained in the small scales. However, fully leveraging the statistical precision of such estimators is hampered by theoretical uncertainties, such as those arising from baryonic physics. Moreover, as non-Gaussian estimators mix different scales, there exists no natural cut-off scale below which baryonic feedback can be completely removed. We therefore present a Bayesian solution for accounting for baryonic feedback uncertainty in weak lensing non-Gaussianity inference. Our solution implements Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a statistical framework that accounts for model uncertainty and combines the strengths of different models to produce more robust and reliable parameter inferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a Stage IV convergence peak counts analysis, including three baryonic feedback models. We find that the resulting BMA posterior distribution safeguards parameter inference against biases due to baryonic feedback, and therefore provides a robust framework for obtaining accurate cosmological constraints at Stage IV precision under model uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>An empirical consistent redshift bias: A possible direct reproducible observation of Zwicky's TL theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have shown tensions between observations and our current understanding of the Universe. Such observations may include the Ho tension, as well as massive and mature galaxies at high redshifts that according to the existing models are older than the Universe itself. Since these observations are based on the redshift as the primary distance indicator, a bias in the redshift may explain these tensions. While the redshift follows an established model, when applied to astronomy it is based on the assumption that the rotational velocity of the Milky Way relative to the rotational velocity of the observed galaxies has a negligible effect on the redshift. But given the mysterious nature of the physics of galaxy rotation, that assumption should be tested. The test is done by comparing the redshift of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way to the redshift of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way. The results show that the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way is significantly higher than the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction. Additionally, the redshift difference becomes larger as the redshift gets higher. The consistency of the analysis was verified by comparing data collected by three different telescopes, annotated using four different methods, released by three different research teams, and cover both the Northern and Southern ends of the galactic pole. All datasets are in excellent agreement with each other, showing consistency in the observed redshift bias. Given the "reproducibility crisis" in science, all datasets used in this study are publicly available, and the results can be easily reproduced. The observation could be a first direct observation for the Zwicky's "tired-light" model.</description>

      <title>What are the Pillars of Reionization? Revising the AGN Luminosity Function at z~5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, high-z AGNs were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidences in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and HST. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z&gt;4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z~5 AGNs (both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST), allowing to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450&lt;-26) of the z~5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450&gt;-22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant and the knee (M1450~-24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z=5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photo-ionization rate produced by z~5 AGNs is consistent with the UV background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z&gt;6, well into the epoch of reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be the major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Lensing with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument -- Probing structure formation at very low redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the science prospects of a 14,000 deg$^2$ Kinematic Lensing (KL) survey with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and overlapping imaging surveys. KL infers the cosmic shear signal by jointly forward modeling the observed photometric image and velocity field of a disk galaxy. The latter can be constrained by placing multiple DESI fibers along the galaxy's major and minor axis, a concept similar to the DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey. We study multiple subset galaxy samples of the DESI Legacy Survey Data Release 9 catalog and quantify the residual shape noise, $\sigma_\epsilon$, of each sample as a function of cuts in $r$-band magnitude using mock observations. We conduct simulated likelihood analyses for these galaxy samples and find that a DESI-KL program can place highly interesting constraints on structure formation at very low redshifts, i.e. $\sigma_8(z&lt;0.15)$. We conclude that if the $S_8$ tension consolidates as a phenomenon, a DESI-KL survey can provide unique insights into this phenomenon in the very late-time Universe. Given the different footprints of DESI and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), lensing results from both surveys are highly complementary and can be combined into a joint lensing survey. We further note that DESI-KL benefits multiple additional science cases, e.g. studies of modified gravity models when combined with peculiar velocity surveys, and dark matter studies that are based on galaxy-galaxy lensing of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Catalog-based pseudo-$C_\ell$s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism to extract the angular power spectrum of fields sampled at a finite number of points with arbitrary positions -- a common situation for several catalog-based astrophysical probes -- through a simple extension of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ algorithm. A key complication in this case is the need to handle the shot noise component of the associated discrete angular mask which, for sparse catalogs, can lead to strong coupling between very different angular scales. We show that this problem can be solved easily by estimating this contribution analytically and subtracting it. The resulting estimator is immune to small-scale pixelization effects and aliasing, and, more interestingly, unbiased against the contribution from measurement noise uncorrelated between different sources. We demonstrate the validity of the method in the context of cosmic shear datasets, and showcase its usage in the case of other spin-0 and spin-1 astrophysical fields of interest. We incorporate the method in the public $\texttt{NaMaster}$ code (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster).</description>

      <title>A Short History of the First 50 Years: from the GRB Prompt Emission and Afterglow Discoveries to the Multimessenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than fifty years have been elapsed from the first discovery of a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) with the American Vela satellites, and more than twenty-five years from the discovery with the BeppoSAX satellite of the first X-ray afterglow of a GRB. Thanks to the afterglow discovery and to the possibility given to the optical and radio astronomers to discover the GRB optical counterparts, the long-time mystery about the origin of these events was solved. Now we know that GRBs are huge explosions, mainly ultra relativistic jets, in galaxies at cosmological distances. Starting from the first GRB detection with the Vela satellites, I will review the story of these discoveries, those obtained with BeppoSAX, the contribution to GRBs by other satellites and ground experiments, among them Venera, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, HETE2, Swift, Fermi, AGILE, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., which were, and some of them are still, very important for the study of GRB properties. Then I will review the main results obtained thus far and the still open problems and prospects of the GRB astronomy.</description>

      <title>Horndeski speed tests with scalar-photon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit multi-messenger constraints from neutron star mergers on the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories. By considering non-trivial couplings between the dark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can propagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the phenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular, we show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories disformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit speed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational couplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We also consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with second order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with constraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>Are isolated compact galaxy groups special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling of Polarized Atmosphere at the South Pole with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of Austral winter survey data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The signal is most significant at large angular scales, high observing frequency, and low elevation angle. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 years of winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. For the SPT-3G data, downweighting the small fraction of significantly contaminated observations is an effective mitigation strategy. In addition, we present a strategy for further improving sensitivity on large angular scales where maps made in the 220 GHz band are used to measure and subtract the polarized atmosphere signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument at the South Pole, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and sub-dominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal pressures from light scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Prime-Cam Optics Overview and Status Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prime-Cam is a first-generation science instrument for the CCAT Observatory's six-meter aperture Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). FYST's crossed-Dragone design provides high optical throughput to take advantage of its unique site at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert to reach mapping speeds over ten times greater than current and near-term submillimeter experiments. Housing up to seven independent instrument modules in its 1.8-meter diameter cryostat, Prime-Cam will combine broadband polarization-sensitive modules and spectrometer modules designed for observations in several frequency windows between 210 GHz and 850 GHz to study a wide range of astrophysical questions from Big Bang cosmology to the formation of stars and galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization and beyond. In order to cover this range of frequencies and observation modes, each of the modules contains a set of cold reimaging optics that is optimized for the science goals of that module. These optical setups include several filters, three or four anti-reflection-coated silicon lenses, and a Lyot stop to control the field of view and illumination of the primary mirror, satisfy a series of mechanical constraints, and maximize optical performance within each passband. We summarize the design considerations and trade-offs for the optics in these modules and provide a status update on the fabrication of the Prime-Cam receiver and the design of its 1 K and 100 mK thermal BUSs.</description>

      <title>Mitigating calibration errors from mutual coupling with time-domain filtering of 21 cm cosmological radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm transition from neutral Hydrogen promises to be the best observational probe of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). This has led to the construction of low-frequency radio interferometric arrays, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), aimed at systematically mapping this emission for the first time. Precision calibration, however, is a requirement in 21 cm radio observations. Due to the spatial compactness of HERA, the array is prone to the effects of mutual coupling, which inevitably lead to non-smooth calibration errors that contaminate the data. When unsmooth gains are used in calibration, intrinsically spectrally-smooth foreground emission begins to contaminate the data in a way that can prohibit a clean detection of the cosmological EoR signal. In this paper, we show that the effects of mutual coupling on calibration quality can be reduced by applying custom time-domain filters to the data prior to calibration. We find that more robust calibration solutions are derived when filtering in this way, which reduces the observed foreground power leakage. Specifically, we find a reduction of foreground power leakage by 2 orders of magnitude at k=0.5.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Polarized Dust Emission from the First Flight of the SPIDER Balloon-Borne Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate that i) the spectral energy distribution of diffuse Galactic dust emission is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) its angular power spectrum is broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) there is no significant detection of line-of-sight decorrelation of the astrophysical polarization. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within a subset of the SPIDER region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. These modeling uncertainties have a small--but non-negligible--impact on limits on the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the \spider dataset. The fidelity of the component separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments may thus have a significant impact on their constraining power.</description>

      <title>Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning models applied to direct dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.</description>

      <title>A new "temperature inversion" estimator to detect CMB patchy screening by large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons imprints various properties of the baryons around galaxies on the CMB. One such imprint, called patchy screening, is a direct probe of the gas density profile around galaxies. It usefully complements the information from the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and does not require individual redshifts. In this paper, we derive new estimators of patchy screening called the "temperature inversion" (TI) and "signed" estimators, analogous to the gradient inversion estimator of CMB lensing. Pedagogically, we clarify the relation between these estimators and the standard patchy screening quadratic estimator (QE). The new estimators trade optimality for robustness to biases caused by the dominant CMB lensing and foreground contaminants, allowing the use of smaller angular scales. We perform a simulated analysis to realistically forecast the expected precision of patchy screening measurements from four CMB experiments, ACT, SPT, Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4, cross-correlated with three galaxy samples from BOSS, unWISE and the simulated Rubin LSST Data Challenge 2 catalog. Our results give further confidence in the first detection of this effect from the ACT$\times$unWISE data in the companion paper and show patchy screening will be a powerful observable for future surveys like SO, CMB-S4 and LSST. Implementations of the patchy screening QE and the TI and signed estimators are publicly available in our LensQuEst and ThumbStack software packages, available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst and https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/ThumbStack , respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shear with small scales: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of the combination of the DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1 weak lensing samples under a joint harmonic-space pipeline making use of angular scales down to $\ell_{\rm max}=4500$, corresponding to significantly smaller scales ($\delta\theta\sim2.4'$) than those commonly used in cosmological weak lensing studies. We are able to do so by accurately modelling non-linearities and the impact of baryonic effects using Baccoemu. We find $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.795^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$, in relatively good agreement with CMB constraints from Planck (less than $\sim1.8\sigma$ tension), although we obtain a low value of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.212^{+0.017}_{-0.032}$, in tension with Planck at the $\sim3\sigma$ level. We show that this can be recast as an $H_0$ tension if one parametrises the amplitude of fluctuations and matter abundance in terms of variables without hidden dependence on $H_0$. Furthermore, we find that this tension reduces significantly after including a prior on the distance-redshift relationship from BAO data, without worsening the fit. In terms of baryonic effects, we show that failing to model and marginalise over them on scales $\ell\lesssim2000$ does not significantly affect the posterior constraints for DES-Y3 and KiDS-1000, but has a mild effect on deeper samples, such as HSC-DR1. This is in agreement with our ability to only mildly constrain the parameters of the Baryon Correction Model with these data</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>2D vs. 3D BAO: quantification of their tension and test of the Etherington relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several studies in the literature have found a disagreement between data on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) derived using two distinct methodologies: the two-dimensional (2D or angular) BAO, which extracts the BAO signal from the angular two-point correlation function; and the three-dimensional (3D) BAO, which also exploits the radial signal imprinted on the large-scale structure of the universe. This discrepancy is worrisome, since many of the points contained in these data sets are obtained from the same catalogs of tracers, so we would expect them to be consistent. Since BAO measurements play a pivotal role in the building of the inverse distance ladder, this mismatch impacts the discourse on the Hubble tension and the theoretical solutions to the latter. So far, the discrepancy between 2D and 3D BAO has been only pointed out in the context of fitting analyses of cosmological models or parametrizations that involve a concrete calibration of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. In this Letter, we avoid the use of any calibration and cosmological model, assuming that the Etherington (a.k.a distance duality) relation holds. We use state-of-the-art measurements in our analysis, and study how the results change when the angular components of the 3D BAO data from BOSS/eBOSS are substituted by the recent data from DESI Y1. We find the tension to exist at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$ and $\sim 2.5\sigma$, respectively, when the SNIa of Pantheon+ are used, and at $\sim 4.6\sigma$ when they are replaced with those of DES Y5. We then apply a calibrator-independent method to investigate the robustness of the distance duality relation when analyzed not only with 3D BAO measurements, but also with 2D BAO. We do not find any hint for a violation of the cosmic distance duality relation in any of the considered data sets. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Relativistic and wide-angle corrections to galaxy power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys contain information on the largest scales via wide-angle and relativistic contributions. By combining two different galaxy populations, we can suppress the strong cosmic variance on ultra-large scales and thus enhance the detectability of the signals. The relativistic Doppler and Sachs-Wolfe effects are of a similar magnitude to the leading wide-angle corrections, so that it is important to treat them together, especially since they can partially cancel. The power spectra depend on the choice of line of sight for each galaxy pair and we present results for a general line of sight. Then we estimate the detection significance of the auto- and cross-power spectra for a variety of cases. We use two futuristic galaxy samples based on a `beyond-DESI' survey and a SKA Phase 2 survey, covering 15,000\,deg$^2$ up to $z=1$. We find a detection significance for the total relativistic wide-angle effects that ranges from $\sim 5\sigma$ to $&gt;15\sigma$, depending on the line-of-sight configuration.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization in the JWST Era: Back to AGNs?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4&lt; z&lt; 14 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, &gt;80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant measurements from gravitational clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant ($H_0$) require us to estimate the distance and recession velocity of galaxies independently. Gravitational clustering that leads to the formation of galaxies and the large scale structure leaves its imprints in the form of peculiar velocities of galaxies. In general, it is not possible to disentangle the peculiar velocity component from the recession velocities of galaxies, and this introduces an uncertainty in the determination of $H_0$. Using N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of peculiar velocities on the $H_0$ estimation. We consider observers to be located in dark matter halos and compute the distribution of the estimated value of $H_0$ across all such observers. We find that the dispersion of this distribution is large at small scales, and it diminishes as we go to large separations, reaching the level of the quoted statistical error in Planck and SH0ES measurements well beyond $\sim$135 Mpc/h and $\sim$220 Mpc/h, respectively. Measurements at smaller scales are susceptible to errors arising from peculiar motions, and this error can propagate to measurements at larger scales in the distance ladder. Notably, we observe a negative correlation between the local over-density around an observer and the deviation of the local and the global value of $H_0$. We show that deviations more significant than 5% of the global values can be encountered frequently at scales of up to 40 Mpc/h, and this is considerably larger than the statistical errors on local estimates. We also analyse the cumulative effect of such errors on mock measurements of $H_0$ as measured from Milky Way-sized halos. We find that this error is sensitive to the lowest distance at which we use measurements. The distribution of $H_0$ in mock measurements has a large tail, and deviations of a few percent from the global value cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristic polarization formation and evolution of vector dark matter (VDM) in the outer halo of galaxies. By employing numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different initial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The simulations solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of total polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite polarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the partially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM kinetically mixed with ordinary photons.</description>

      <title>The split majoron model confronts the NANOGrav signal and cosmological tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the light of the evidence of a gravitational wave background from the NANOGrav 15yr data set, we reconsider the split majoron model as a new physics extension of the standard model able to generate a needed contribution to solve the current tension between the data and the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole massive binaries. In the split majoron model the seesaw right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses from spontaneous symmetry breaking of global $U(1)_{B-L}$ in a strong first order phase transition of a complex scalar field occurring above the electroweak scale. The final vacuum expectation value couples to a second complex scalar field undergoing a low scale phase transition occurring after neutrino decoupling. Such a coupling enhances the strength of this second low scale first order phase transition and can generate a sizeable primordial gravitational wave background contributing to the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Some amount of extra-radiation is generated after neutron-to-proton ration freeze-out but prior to nucleosynthesis. This can be either made compatible with current upper bound from primordial deuterium measurements or even be used to solve a potential deuterium problem. Moreover, the free streaming length of light neutrinos can be suppressed by their interactions with the resulting majoron background and this mildly ameliorates existing cosmological tensions. Thus cosmological observations nicely provide independent motivations for the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement in Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to significantly enhance the signal rate in qubit-based dark matter detection experiments with the help of quantum interference. Various quantum sensors possess ideal properties for detecting wave-like dark matter, and qubits, commonly employed in quantum computers, are excellent candidates for dark matter detectors. We demonstrate that, by designing an appropriate quantum circuit to manipulate the qubits, the signal rate scales proportionally to $n_{\rm q}^2$, with $n_{\rm q}$ being the number of sensor qubits, rather than linearly with $n_{\rm q}$. Consequently, in the dark matter detection with a substantial number of sensor qubits, a significant increase in the signal rate can be expected. We provide a specific example of a quantum circuit that achieves this enhancement by coherently combining the phase evolution in each individual qubit due to its interaction with dark matter. We also demonstrate that the circuit is fault tolerant to de-phasing noises, a critical quantum noise source in quantum computers. The enhancement mechanism proposed here is applicable to various modalities for quantum computers, provided that the quantum operations relevant to enhancing the dark matter signal can be applied to these devices.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Forecasting the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing population for the China Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing (GGSL) is a powerful probe for the formation and evolution of galaxies and cosmology, while the sample size of GGSLs leads to considerable uncertainties and potential bias. The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, to be launched in late 2026) will conduct observations across 17,500 square degrees of the sky, capturing images in the $ugriz$ bands with a spatial resolution comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope. We ran a set of Monte Carlo simulations to predict that the CSST's wide-field survey will observe $\sim$160,000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses over its lifespan, increasing the number of existing galaxy-galaxy strong lens samples by three orders of magnitude. This is comparable to the capabilities of the $\it Euclid$ telescope but with the added benefit of additional color information. Specifically, the CSST can detect strong lenses with Einstein radii about $0.64\pm0.42^{"}$, corresponding to the velocity dispersions of $217.19 \pm 50.55 \, \text{km/s}$. These lenses exhibit a median magnification of $\sim$5. The apparent magnitude of the unlensed sources in the g-band is $25.87 \pm 1.19$. The signal-to-noise ratio of the lensed images covers a range of $\sim 20$ to $\sim 1000$, allowing us to determine the Einstein radius with an accuracy ranging from $\sim 1 \%$ to $\sim 0.1 \%$, ignoring various modeling systematics. Our estimates indicate that CSST can observe rare systems like double source-plane and spiral galaxy lenses. The above selection functions of the CSST strong lensing observation help optimize the strategy of finding and modeling GGSLs.</description>

      <title>Collisions and collective flavor conversion: Integrating out the fast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense astrophysical environments, notably core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, neutrino-neutrino forward scattering can spawn flavor conversion on very short scales. Scattering with the background medium can impact collective flavor conversion in various ways, either damping oscillations or possibly setting off novel collisional flavor instabilities (CFIs). A key feature in this process is the slowness of collisions compared to the much faster dynamics of neutrino-neutrino refraction. Assuming spatial homogeneity, we leverage this hierarchy of scales to simplify the description accounting only for the slow dynamics driven by collisions. We illustrate our new approach both in the case of CFIs and in the case of fast instabilities damped by collisions. In both cases, our strategy provides new equations, the slow-dynamics equations, that simplify the description of flavor conversion and allow us to qualitatively understand the final state of the system after the instability, either collisional or fast, has saturated.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Kinetic Equation for Mixed Neutrinos: Tracing the Missing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flavor-dependent neutrino transport is described by a well-known kinetic equation for occupation-number matrices in flavor space. However, as an overlooked theoretical problem, we show that in the inhomogeneous case, neutrino-neutrino refractive energy is not conserved. We derive the missing gradient terms in the fast flavor limit (vanishing neutrino masses), and prove that the missing refractive energy is traded with the huge reservoir of neutrino kinetic energy through gradients of the weak interaction potential. Even small changes of the kinetic energy accommodate the refractive energy gained or lost. Flavor evolution alone is negligibly affected by the new terms.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>
