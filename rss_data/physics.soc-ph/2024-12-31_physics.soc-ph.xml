      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning and Physics-based Modelling of Pedestrian Pushing Behaviours at Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-density crowds, close proximity between pedestrians makes the steady state highly vulnerable to disruption by pushing behaviours, potentially leading to serious accidents. However, the scarcity of experimental data has hindered systematic studies of its mechanisms and accurate modelling. Using behavioural data from bottleneck experiments, we investigate pedestrian heterogeneity in pushing tendencies, showing that pedestrians tend to push under high-motivation and in wider corridors. We introduce a spatial discretization method to encode neighbour states into feature vectors, serving together with pedestrian pushing tendencies as inputs to a random forest model for predicting pushing behaviours. Through comparing speed-headway relationships, we reveal that pushing behaviours correspond to an aggressive space-utilization movement strategy. Consequently, we propose a hybrid machine learning and physics-based model integrating pushing tendencies heterogeneity, pushing behaviours prediction, and dynamic movement strategies adjustment. Validations show that the hybrid model effectively reproduces experimental crowd dynamics and fits to incorporate additional behaviours.</description>

      <title>Iterative structural coarse-graining for contagion dynamics in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contagion dynamics in complex networks drive critical phenomena such as epidemic spread and information diffusion,but their analysis remains computationally prohibitive in large-scale, high-complexity systems. Here, we introduce the Iterative Structural Coarse-Graining (ISCG) framework, a scalable methodology that reduces network complexity while preserving key contagion dynamics with high fidelity. Importantly, we derive theoretical conditions ensuring the precise preservation of both macroscopic outbreak sizes and microscopic node-level infection probabilities during network reduction. Under these conditions, extensive experiments on diverse empirical networks demonstrate that ISCG achieves significant complexity reduction without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Beyond simplification, ISCG reveals multiscale structural patterns that govern contagion processes, enabling practical solutions to longstanding challenges in contagion dynamics. Specifically, ISCG outperforms traditional adaptive centrality-based approaches in identifying influential spreaders, immunizing critical edges, and optimizing sentinel placement for early outbreak detection, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency. By bridging computational efficiency with dynamical fidelity, ISCG provides a transformative framework for analyzing large-scale contagion processes, with broad applications for epidemiology, information dissemination, and network resilience.</description>

      <title>Aging behavior of the scale-free network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of users on social media continues to increase during the growth phase. Still, eventually, the number of new users balances out the number of departing users, and the number of users becomes almost constant. To investigate how network properties change under these conditions, we study the aging behavior of the network. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab'asi model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We defined $\alpha$ as the node deletion parameter and $\beta$ as the node addition parameter. The larger $\alpha$ yields, the higher the probability of deleting a node with a larger degree, and the larger $\beta$ yields, the higher the probability of connecting to a node with a larger degree and fitness. We found that the network cannot reach a steady state in some parameter regions. We investigated the degree distribution of the network that reached a steady state. The scale-free nature of the network broke down in regions where $\alpha$ is large and $\beta$ is small, and the degree distribution became exponential. We also performed percolation analyses. While the phase transition point was zero in the scale-free network, the phase transition point changed finitely in regions with large $\alpha$ and small $\beta$. The phase diagram of whether the degree distribution is power-law or exponential and whether the phase transition point of percolation is zero or finite exhibits a good agreement between the phase boundaries. This study is expected to help control network structure in mature networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning in the all-or-nothing public goods game on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interpersonal trust by means of the all-or-nothing public goods game between agents on a network. The agents are endowed with the simple yet adaptive learning rule, exponential moving average, by which they estimate the behavior of their neighbors in the network. Theoretically we show that in the long-time limit this multi-agent reinforcement learning process always eventually results in indefinite contribution to the public good or indefinite defection (no agent contributing to the public good). However, by simulation of the pre-limit behavior, we see that on complex network structures there may be mixed states in which the process seems to stabilize before actual convergence to states in which agent beliefs and actions are all the same. In these metastable states the local network characteristics can determine whether agents have high or low trust in their neighbors. More generally it is found that more dense networks result in lower rates of contribution to the public good. This has implications for how one can spread global contribution toward a public good by enabling smaller local interactions.</description>

      <title>Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While homophily -- the tendency to link with similar others -- may nurture a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network. We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.</description>

      <title>BikeNodePlanner: a data-driven decision support tool for bicycle node network planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bicycle node network is a wayfinding system targeted at recreational cyclists, consisting of numbered signposts placed alongside already existing infrastructure. Bicycle node networks are becoming increasingly popular as they encourage sustainable tourism and rural cycling, while also being flexible and cost-effective to implement. However, the lack of a formalized methodology and data-driven tools for the planning of such networks is a hindrance to their adaptation on a larger scale. To address this need, we present the BikeNodePlanner: a fully open-source decision support tool, consisting of modular Python scripts to be run in the free and open-source geographic information system QGIS. The BikeNodePlanner allows the user to evaluate and compare bicycle node network plans through a wide range of metrics, such as land use, proximity to points of interest, and elevation across the network. The BikeNodePlanner provides data-driven decision support for bicycle node network planning, and can hence be of great use for regional planning, cycling tourism, and the promotion of rural cycling.</description>

      <title>Supervised centrality via sparse network influence regression: an application to the 2021 Henan floods' social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The social characteristics of players in a social network are closely associated with their network positions and relational importance. Identifying those influential players in a network is of great importance as it helps to understand how ties are formed, how information is propagated, and, in turn, can guide the dissemination of new information. Motivated by a Sina Weibo social network analysis of the 2021 Henan Floods, where response variables for each Sina Weibo user are available, we propose a new notion of supervised centrality that emphasizes the task-specific nature of a player's centrality. To estimate the supervised centrality and identify important players, we develop a novel sparse network influence regression by introducing individual heterogeneity for each user. To overcome the computational difficulties in fitting the model for large social networks, we further develop a forward-addition algorithm and show that it can consistently identify a superset of the influential Sina Weibo users. We apply our method to analyze three responses in the Henan Floods data: the number of comments, reposts, and likes, and obtain meaningful results. A further simulation study corroborates the developed method.</description>
