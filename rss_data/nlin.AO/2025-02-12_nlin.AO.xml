      <title>Network Dynamics in Mixed Martial Arts: A Complex Systems Approach to Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Competition Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has grown from a niche combat sport promotion into a globally recognized competitive enterprise. This study applies complex network analysis to explore the structural evolution of UFC matchmaking and its impact on competitive dynamics, fighter prominence, and audience engagement. By constructing directed and undirected networks where fighters represent nodes and bouts define edges, we examine key metrics such as degree distribution, clustering, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Our findings reveal how the UFC's matchmaking strategies transitioned from tightly clustered, repetitive matchups in its early years to a more decentralized and strategically curated fight network. We identify distinct structural properties between winners and losers, showing that successful fighters maintain centrality while frequently losing fighters exhibit surprising degrees of sustained connectivity. Correlations with Pay-Per-View sales and Google search trends suggest that network dispersion and novelty in matchups drive greater audience interest, while excessive clustering and density reduce engagement. Furthermore, comparisons with official rankings (Pound-for-Pound, champions, and top-15 fighters) demonstrate that traditional success metrics only partially align with network-based prominence, highlighting the complex interplay between structural connectivity, commercial appeal, and competitive success. This research contributes to the understanding of sports as complex adaptive systems and provides insights into how strategic matchmaking shapes both competitive integrity and economic viability in professional mixed martial arts.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behavior, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this framework, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.</description>
