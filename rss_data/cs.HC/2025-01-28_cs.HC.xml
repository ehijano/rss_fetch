      <title>The Many Tendrils of the Octopus Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conspiratorial thinking can connect many distinct or distant ills to a central cause. This belief has visual form in the octopus map: a map where a central force (for instance a nation, an ideology, or an ethnicity) is depicted as a literal or figurative octopus, with extending tendrils. In this paper, we explore how octopus maps function as visual arguments through an analysis of historical examples as well as a through a crowd-sourced study on how the underlying data and the use of visual metaphors contribute to specific negative or conspiratorial interpretations. We find that many features of the data or visual style can lead to "octopus-like" thinking in visualizations, even without the use of an explicit octopus motif. We conclude with a call for a deeper analysis of visual rhetoric, and an acknowledgment of the potential for the design of data visualizations to contribute to harmful or conspiratorial thinking.</description>

      <title>Mining Evidence about Your Symptoms: Mitigating Availability Bias in Online Self-Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People frequently exposed to health information on social media tend to overestimate their symptoms during online self-diagnosis due to availability bias. This may lead to incorrect self-medication and place additional burdens on healthcare providers to correct patients' misconceptions. In this work, we conducted two mixed-method studies to identify design goals for mitigating availability bias in online self-diagnosis. We investigated factors that distort self-assessment of symptoms after exposure to social media. We found that availability bias is pronounced when social media content resonated with individuals, making them disregard their own evidences. To address this, we developed and evaluated three chatbot-based symptom checkers designed to foster evidence-based self-reflection for bias mitigation given their potential to encourage thoughtful responses. Results showed that chatbot-based symptom checkers with cognitive intervention strategies mitigated the impact of availability bias in online self-diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mobile Game-Based Learning for Raising Adolescent Health Awareness: The Case of "AHlam Na 2.0"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a critical gap in adolescent health education strategies in the Philippines, as highlighted by the Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality (YAFS) survey series, which overlooks the use of games as a medium for disseminating health information. To bridge this gap, the research introduces AHlam Na, a game-based mobile application designed to enhance adolescents' awareness and understanding of key health-related topics. Using a single-group pretest-posttest design, the study involved forty junior high school students from a randomly selected school in the Philippines. They interacted with the application that embedded adolescent health topics into its gameplay. Data collected through pretest and post-test surveys revealed a significant improvement in the student's knowledge and attitudes toward adolescent health after engaging in the game, indicating that game-based learning effectively enhances their learning experience. The positive reception and knowledge gains suggest that AHlam Na is a promising tool for promoting adolescent health awareness. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the application be integrated into the adolescent health curriculum in schools across the Philippines. Future studies should examine the long-term impact of game-based learning on health behaviors and expand the sample size to include more diverse demographic groups. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on game-based learning in health education by demonstrating the potential of digital games to address the limitations of traditional teaching methods. The successful implementation of AHlam Na underscores the importance of exploring gamified learning tools to deliver critical health information to young people effectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Collaborative Co-Creation Process with AI: A Case Study in Novice Music Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping creative domains, yet its co-creative processes, especially in group settings with novice users, remain under explored. To bridge this gap, we conducted a case study in a college-level course where nine undergraduate students were tasked with creating three original music tracks using AI tools over 10 weeks. The study spanned the entire creative journey from ideation to releasing these songs on Spotify. Participants leveraged AI for music and lyric production, cover art, and distribution. Our findings highlight how AI transforms creative workflows: accelerating ideation but compressing the traditional preparation stage, and requiring novices to navigate a challenging idea selection and validation phase. We also identified a new "collaging and refinement" stage, where participants creatively combined diverse AI-generated outputs into cohesive works. Furthermore, AI influenced group social dynamics and role division among human creators. Based on these insights, we propose the Human-AI Co-Creation Stage Model and the Human-AI Agency Model, offering new perspectives on collaborative co-creation with AI.</description>

      <title>Perception of an AI Teammate in an Embodied Control Task Affects Team Performance, Reflected in Human Teammates' Behaviors and Physiological Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human teams is widely expected to enhance performance and collaboration. However, our study reveals a striking and counterintuitive result: human-AI teams performed worse than human-only teams, especially when task difficulty increased. Using a virtual reality-based sensorimotor task, we observed that the inclusion of an active human-like AI teammate disrupted team dynamics, leading to elevated arousal, reduced engagement, and diminished communication intensity among human participants. These effects persisted even as the human teammates' perception of the AI teammate improved over time. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the benefits of AI in team settings and highlight the critical need for human-centered AI design to mitigate adverse physiological and behavioral impacts, ensuring more effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Between Puppet and Actor: Reframing Authorship in this Age of AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines the conceptual tensions in understanding artificial intelligence (AI) agents' role in creative processes, particularly focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon Schmidt's 1954 categorization of human-technology relationships and the classical definition of "author," this chapter proposes to understand AI agency as existing somewhere between that of an inanimate puppet and a performing actor. While AI agents demonstrate a degree of creative autonomy, including the ability to improvise and construct complex narrative content in interactive storytelling, they cannot be considered authors in the classical sense of the term. This chapter thus suggests that AI agents exist in a dynamic state between human-controlled puppets and semi-autonomous actors. This conceptual positioning reflects how AI agents, while they can certainly contribute to creative work, remain bound to human direction. We also argue that existing conceptual frames concerning authorship should evolve and adapt to capture these new relationships.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Population Encoding for Multi-joint Regression using sEMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression-based decoding of continuous movements is essential for human-machine interfaces (HMIs), such as prosthetic control. This study explores a feature-based approach to encoding Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, focusing on the role of variability in neural-inspired population encoding. By employing heterogeneous populations of Leaky Integrate-and- Fire (LIF) neurons with varying sizes and diverse parameter distributions, we investigate how population size and variability in encoding parameters, such as membrane time constants and thresholds, influence decoding performance. Using a simple linear readout, we demonstrate that variability improves robustness and generalizability compared to single-neuron encoders. These findings emphasize the importance of optimizing variability and population size for efficient and scalable regression tasks in spiking neural networks (SNNs), paving the way for robust, low-power HMI implementations.</description>

      <title>Memory Reviver: Supporting Photo-Collection Reminiscence for People with Visual Impairment via a Proactive Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reminiscing with photo collections offers significant psychological benefits but poses challenges for people with visual impairment (PVI). Their current reliance on sighted help restricts the flexibility of this activity. In response, we explored using a chatbot in a preliminary study. We identified two primary challenges that hinder effective reminiscence with a chatbot: the scattering of information and a lack of proactive guidance. To address these limitations, we present Memory Reviver, a proactive chatbot that helps PVI reminisce with a photo collection through natural language communication. Memory Reviver incorporates two novel features: (1) a Memory Tree, which uses a hierarchical structure to organize the information in a photo collection; and (2) a Proactive Strategy, which actively delivers information to users at proper conversation rounds. Evaluation with twelve PVI demonstrated that Memory Reviver effectively facilitated engaging reminiscence, enhanced understanding of photo collections, and delivered natural conversational experiences. Based on our findings, we distill implications for supporting photo reminiscence and designing chatbots for PVI.</description>

      <title>XR-penter: Material-Aware and In Situ Design of Scrap Wood Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Woodworkers have to navigate multiple considerations when planning a project, including available resources, skill-level, and intended effort. Do it yourself (DIY) woodworkers face these challenges most acutely because of tight material constraints and a desire for custom designs tailored to specific spaces. To address these needs, we present XR-penter, an extended reality (XR) application that supports in situ, material-aware woodworking for casual makers. Our system enables users to design virtual scrap wood assemblies directly in their workspace, encouraging sustainable practices through the use of discarded materials. Users register physical material as virtual twins, manipulate these twins into an assembly in XR, and preview cuts needed for fabrication. We conducted a case study and feedback sessions to demonstrate how XR-penter supports improvisational workflows in practice, the type of woodworker who would benefit most from our system, and insights on integrating similar spatial and material considerations into future work.</description>

      <title>"See What I Imagine, Imagine What I See": Human-AI Co-Creation System for 360$^\circ$ Panoramic Video Generation in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of panoramic video generation from text and image prompts unlocks new creative possibilities in virtual reality (VR), addressing the limitations of current immersive experiences, which are constrained by pre-designed environments that restrict user creativity. To advance this frontier, we present Imagine360, a proof-of-concept prototype that integrates co-creation principles with AI agents. This system enables refined speech-based text prompts, egocentric perspective adjustments, and real-time customization of virtual surroundings based on user perception and intent. An eight-participant pilot study comparing non-AI and linear AI-driven workflows demonstrates that Imagine360's co-creative approach effectively integrates temporal and spatial creative controls. This introduces a transformative VR paradigm, allowing users to seamlessly transition between 'seeing' and 'imagining,' thereby shaping virtual reality through the creations of their minds.</description>

      <title>Mind the Value-Action Gap: Do LLMs Act in Alignment with Their Values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research primarily evaluates the values of LLMs by examining their stated inclinations towards specific values. However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Performance Measurements and the Impact of Sleep Quality Using Wearable and Mobile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cognitive performance is an underlying factor in most of our daily lives, and numerous factors influence cognitive performance. In this work, we investigate how changes in sleep quality influence cognitive performance, measured from a dataset collected during a 2-month field study. We collected cognitive performance data (alertness) with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), mobile keyboard typing metrics from participants' smartphones, and sleep quality metrics through a wearable sleep tracking ring. Our findings highlight that specific sleep metrics like night-time heart rate, sleep latency, sleep timing, sleep restfulness, and overall sleep quantity significantly influence cognitive performance. To strengthen the current research on cognitive measurements, we introduce smartphone typing metrics as a proxy or a complementary method for continuous passive measurement of cognitive performance. Together, our findings contribute to ubiquitous computing via a longitudinal case study with a novel wearable device, the resulting findings on the association between sleep and cognitive function, and the introduction of smartphone keyboard typing as a proxy of cognitive function.</description>

      <title>Evaluating an LLM-Powered Chatbot for Cognitive Restructuring: Insights from Mental Health Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise to expand mental health interventions by emulating therapeutic techniques, potentially easing barriers to care. Yet there is a lack of real-world empirical evidence evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLM-enabled psychotherapy interventions. In this work, we evaluate an LLM-powered chatbot, designed via prompt engineering to deliver cognitive restructuring (CR), with 19 users. Mental health professionals then examined the resulting conversation logs to uncover potential benefits and pitfalls. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based CR approach has the capability to adhere to core CR protocols, prompt Socratic questioning, and provide empathetic validation. However, issues of power imbalances, advice-giving, misunderstood cues, and excessive positivity reveal deeper challenges, including the potential to erode therapeutic rapport and ethical concerns. We also discuss design implications for leveraging LLMs in psychotherapy and underscore the importance of expert oversight to mitigate these concerns, which are critical steps toward safer, more effective AI-assisted interventions.</description>

      <title>Engage and Mobilize! Understanding Evolving Patterns of Social Media Usage in Emergency Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work of Emergency Management (EM) agencies requires timely collection of relevant data to inform decision-making for operations and public communication before, during, and after a disaster. However, the limited human resources available to deploy for field data collection is a persistent problem for EM agencies. Thus, many of these agencies have started leveraging social media as a supplemental data source and a new venue to engage with the public. While prior research has analyzed the potential benefits and attitudes of practitioners and the public when leveraging social media during disasters, a gap exists in the critical analysis of the actual practices and uses of social media among EM agencies, across both geographical regions and phases of the EM lifecycle - typically mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method analysis to update and fill this gap on how EM practitioners in the U.S. and Europe use social media, building on a survey study of about 150 professionals and a follow-up interview study with 11 participants. The results indicate that using social media is no longer a non-traditional practice in operational and informational processes for the decision-making of EM agencies working at both the local level (e.g., county or town) and non-local level (e.g., state/province, federal/national) for emergency management. Especially, the practitioners affiliated with agencies working at the local level have a very high perceived value of social media for situational awareness (e.g., analyzing disaster extent and impact) and public communication (e.g., disseminating timely information and correcting errors in crisis coverage). We conclude with the policy, technological, and socio-technical needs to design future social media analytics systems to support the work of EM agencies in such communication including the applications of AI.</description>

      <title>Understanding Attitudes and Trust of Generative AI Chatbots for Social Anxiety Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social anxiety (SA) has become increasingly prevalent. Traditional coping strategies often face accessibility challenges. Generative AI (GenAI), known for their knowledgeable and conversational capabilities, are emerging as alternative tools for mental well-being. With the increased integration of GenAI, it is important to examine individuals' attitudes and trust in GenAI chatbots' support for SA. Through a mixed-method approach that involved surveys (n = 159) and interviews (n = 17), we found that individuals with severe symptoms tended to trust and embrace GenAI chatbots more readily, valuing their non-judgmental support and perceived emotional comprehension. However, those with milder symptoms prioritized technical reliability. We identified factors influencing trust, such as GenAI chatbots' ability to generate empathetic responses and its context-sensitive limitations, which were particularly important among individuals with SA. We also discuss the design implications and use of GenAI chatbots in fostering cognitive and emotional trust, with practical and design considerations.</description>

      <title>DanmuA11y: Making Time-Synced On-Screen Video Comments (Danmu) Accessible to Blind and Low Vision Users via Multi-Viewer Audio Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By overlaying time-synced user comments on videos, Danmu creates a co-watching experience for online viewers. However, its visual-centric design poses significant challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) viewers. Our formative study identified three primary challenges that hinder BLV viewers' engagement with Danmu: the lack of visual context, the speech interference between comments and videos, and the disorganization of comments. To address these challenges, we present DanmuA11y, a system that makes Danmu accessible by transforming it into multi-viewer audio discussions. DanmuA11y incorporates three core features: (1) Augmenting Danmu with visual context, (2) Seamlessly integrating Danmu into videos, and (3) Presenting Danmu via multi-viewer discussions. Evaluation with twelve BLV viewers demonstrated that DanmuA11y significantly improved Danmu comprehension, provided smooth viewing experiences, and fostered social connections among viewers. We further highlight implications for enhancing commentary accessibility in video-based social media and live-streaming platforms.</description>

      <title>On Parallelism in Music and Language: A Perspective from Symbol Emergence Systems based on Probabilistic Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music and language are structurally similar. Such structural similarity is often explained by generative processes. This paper describes the recent development of probabilistic generative models (PGMs) for language learning and symbol emergence in robotics. Symbol emergence in robotics aims to develop a robot that can adapt to real-world environments and human linguistic communications and acquire language from sensorimotor information alone (i.e., in an unsupervised manner). This is regarded as a constructive approach to symbol emergence systems. To this end, a series of PGMs have been developed, including those for simultaneous phoneme and word discovery, lexical acquisition, object and spatial concept formation, and the emergence of a symbol system. By extending the models, a symbol emergence system comprising a multi-agent system in which a symbol system emerges is revealed to be modeled using PGMs. In this model, symbol emergence can be regarded as collective predictive coding. This paper expands on this idea by combining the theory that ''emotion is based on the predictive coding of interoceptive signals'' and ''symbol emergence systems,'' and describes the possible hypothesis of the emergence of meaning in music.</description>

      <title>Gensors: Authoring Personalized Visual Sensors with Multimodal Foundation Models and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with their expansive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, present a unique opportunity for end-users to create personalized AI sensors capable of reasoning about complex situations. A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., "alert if my toddler is getting into mischief"), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users "stress test" sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a user study, participants reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users' "blind spots" by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we discuss how unique characteristics of MLLMs--such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses--can impact the sensor-creation process. These findings contribute to the design of future intelligent sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.</description>

      <title>Walk in Their Shoes to Navigate Your Own Path: Learning About Procrastination Through A Serious Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procrastination, the voluntary delay of tasks despite potential negative consequences, has prompted numerous time and task management interventions in the HCI community. While these interventions have shown promise in addressing specific behaviors, psychological theories suggest that learning about procrastination itself may help individuals develop their own coping strategies and build mental resilience. However, little research has explored how to support this learning process through HCI approaches. We present ProcrastiMate, a text adventure game where players learn about procrastination's causes and experiment with coping strategies by guiding in-game characters in managing relatable scenarios. Our field study with 27 participants revealed that ProcrastiMate facilitated learning and self-reflection while maintaining psychological distance, motivating players to integrate newly acquired knowledge in daily life. This paper contributes empirical insights on leveraging serious games to facilitate learning about procrastination and offers design implications for addressing psychological challenges through HCI approaches.</description>

      <title>Navigation Framework for Blind and Visually Impaired Persons based on Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals who are differently-able in vision cannot proceed with their day-to-day activities as smoothly as other people do. Especially independent walking is a hard target to achieve with their visual impairment. Assistive electronic travel aids equipped with different types of sensors are designed for visually impaired persons to assist their safe navigation. The amount of research on combining multiple sensors in assistive navigation aids for visually impaired navigation is limited. Most work is targeted at sensor integration but not at sensor fusion. This paper aims to address how sensor fusion and integration will be used to improve the sub-processes of visually impaired navigation and the way to evaluate the sensor fusion-based approach for visually impaired navigation which consists of several contributions to field sensor fusion in visually impaired navigation such as a novel homogeneous sensor fusion algorithm based on extended Kalman filter, a novel heterogeneous sensor integration approach, and a complementary sensor fusion algorithm based on error state extended Kaman filter. Overall this research presents a novel navigational framework to integrate obstacle detection, obstacle recognition, localization, motion planning, and current context awareness with sensor fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) has emerged as a promising approach to the development of emotion-aware intelligent agents and systems. However, key challenges remain in utilizing FER in real-world contexts, including ensuring user understanding and establishing a suitable level of user trust. We developed a novel explanation method utilizing Facial Action Units (FAUs) to explain the output of a FER model through both textual and visual modalities. We conducted an empirical user study evaluating user understanding and trust, comparing our approach to state-of-the-art eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. Our results indicate that visual AND textual as well as textual-only FAU-based explanations resulted in better user understanding of the FER model. We also show that all modalities of FAU-based methods improved appropriate trust of the users towards the FER model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing need for diverse, high-quality stuttered speech data, particularly in the context of Indian languages. This paper introduces Project Boli, a multi-lingual stuttered speech dataset designed to advance scientific understanding and technology development for individuals who stutter, particularly in India. The dataset constitutes (a) anonymized metadata (gender, age, country, mother tongue) and responses to a questionnaire about how stuttering affects their daily lives, (b) captures both read speech (using the Rainbow Passage) and spontaneous speech (through image description tasks) for each participant and (c) includes detailed annotations of five stutter types: blocks, prolongations, interjections, sound repetitions and word repetitions. We present a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including the data collection procedure, experience summarization of people who stutter, severity assessment of stuttering events and technical validation of the collected data. The dataset is released as an open access to further speech technology development.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, High-Precision Human-Machine Interaction Solution Based on Multi-Coil Wireless Charging Pads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless charging pads are common, yet their functionality is mainly restricted to charging. Existing gesture recognition techniques, such as those based on machine vision and WiFi, have drawbacks like high costs and poor precision. This paper presents a new human machine interaction solution using multicoil wireless charging pads. The proposed approach leverages the pads existing modules without additional wearable sensors. It determines gestures by monitoring current and power changes in different coils. The data processing includes noise removal, sorting, highpass filtering, and slicing. A Bayesian network and particle filtering are employed for motion tracking. Through experiments, this solution proves to have wide applications, high recognition accuracy, and low cost. It can effectively identify diverse gestures, increasing the value of wireless charging pads. It outperforms traditional methods, with a 0.73 improvement in recognition accuracy and better environmental adaptability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the integration of IoT devices in virtual spaces is becoming increasingly common, technical barriers to controlling custom devices in multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) environments remain high, particularly limiting new applications in educational and prototyping settings. We propose MetaGadget, a framework for connecting IoT devices to commercial metaverse platforms that implements device control through HTTP-based event triggers without requiring persistent client connections. Through two workshops focused on smart home control and custom device integration, we explored the potential application of IoT connectivity in multi-user metaverse environments. Participants successfully implemented new interactions unique to the metaverse, such as environmental sensing and remote control systems that support simultaneous operation by multiple users, and reported positive feedback on the ease of system development. We verified that our framework provides a new approach to controlling IoT devices in the metaverse while reducing technical requirements, and provides a foundation for creative practice that connects multi-user VR environments and physical spaces.</description>

      <title>MaRginalia: Enabling In-person Lecture Capturing and Note-taking Through Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Students often take digital notes during live lectures, but current methods can be slow when capturing information from lecture slides or the instructor's speech, and require them to focus on their devices, leading to distractions and missing important details. This paper explores supporting live lecture note-taking with mixed reality (MR) to quickly capture lecture information and take notes while staying engaged with the lecture. A survey and interviews with university students revealed common note-taking behaviors and challenges to inform the design. We present MaRginalia to provide digital note-taking with a stylus tablet and MR headset. Students can take notes with an MR representation of the tablet, lecture slides, and audio transcript without looking down at their device. When preferred, students can also perform detailed interactions by looking at the physical tablet. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of MaRginalia and MR-based note-taking in a user study with 12 students.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting online privacy requires users to engage with and comprehend website privacy policies, but many policies are difficult and tedious to read. We present PRISMe (Privacy Risk Information Scanner for Me), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven privacy policy assessment tool, which helps users to understand the essence of a lengthy, complex privacy policy while browsing. The tool, a browser extension, integrates a dashboard and an LLM chat. One major contribution is the first rigorous evaluation of such a tool. In a mixed-methods user study (N=22), we evaluate PRISMe's efficiency, usability, understandability of the provided information, and impacts on awareness. While our tool improves privacy awareness by providing a comprehensible quick overview and a quality chat for in-depth discussion, users note issues with consistency and building trust in the tool. From our insights, we derive important design implications to guide future policy analysis tools.</description>

      <title>The Unbearable Lightness of Prompting: A Critical Reflection on the Environmental Impact of genAI use in Design Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design educators are finding ways to support students in skillfully using GenAI tools in their practices while encouraging the critical scrutiny of the ethical and social issues around these technologies. However, the issue of environmental sustainability remains unaddressed. There is a lack of both resources to grasp the environmental costs of genAI in education and a lack of shared practices for engaging with the issue. This paper critically reflects on the energy costs of using genAI in design education, using a workshop held in 2023 with 49 students as a motivating example. Through this reflection, we develop a set of five alternative stances, with related actions, that support the conscious use of genAI in design education. The work contributes to the field of design and HCI by bringing together ways for educators to reflect on their practices, informing the future development of educational programs around genAI.</description>

Abstract: Automation and semi-automation through computational tools like LLMs are also making their way to deployment in research synthesis and secondary research, such as systematic reviews. In some steps of research synthesis, this has the opportunity to provide substantial benefits by saving time that previously was spent on repetitive tasks. The screening stages in particular may benefit from carefully vetted computational support. However, this position paper argues for additional caution when bringing in such tools to the analysis and synthesis phases, where human judgement and expertise should be paramount throughout the process.</description>

      <title>MIND-EEG: Multi-granularity Integration Network with Discrete Codebook for EEG-based Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has broad potential across various domains. EEG signals have ability to capture rich spatial information related to brain activity, yet effectively modeling and utilizing these spatial relationships remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle with simplistic spatial structure modeling, failing to capture complex node interactions, and lack generalizable spatial connection representations, failing to balance the dynamic nature of brain networks with the need for discriminative and generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-granularity Integration Network with Discrete Codebook for EEG-based Emotion Recognition (MIND-EEG). The framework employs a multi-granularity approach, integrating global and regional spatial information through a Global State Encoder, an Intra-Regional Functionality Encoder, and an Inter-Regional Interaction Encoder to comprehensively model brain activity. Additionally, we introduce a discrete codebook mechanism for constructing network structures via vector quantization, ensuring compact and meaningful brain network representations while mitigating over-smoothing and enhancing model generalization. The proposed framework effectively captures the dynamic and diverse nature of EEG signals, enabling robust emotion recognition. Extensive comparisons and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MIND-EEG, and the source code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MIND_EEG.</description>

      <title>AiGet: Transforming Everyday Moments into Hidden Knowledge Discovery with AI Assistance on Smart Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the free exploration of childhood, the demands of daily life reduce our motivation to explore our surroundings, leading to missed opportunities for informal learning. Traditional tools for knowledge acquisition are reactive, relying on user initiative and limiting their ability to uncover hidden interests. Through formative studies, we introduce AiGet, a proactive AI assistant integrated with AR smart glasses, designed to seamlessly embed informal learning into low-demand daily activities (e.g., casual walking and shopping). AiGet analyzes real-time user gaze patterns, environmental context, and user profiles, leveraging large language models to deliver personalized, context-aware knowledge with low disruption to primary tasks. In-lab evaluations and real-world testing, including continued use over multiple days, demonstrate AiGet's effectiveness in uncovering overlooked yet surprising interests, enhancing primary task enjoyment, reviving curiosity, and deepening connections with the environment. We further propose design guidelines for AI-assisted informal learning, focused on transforming everyday moments into enriching learning experiences.</description>

      <title>Exploring Data-Driven Advocacy in Home Health Care Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores opportunities and challenges for data-driven advocacy to support home care workers, an often overlooked group of low-wage, frontline health workers. First, we investigate what data to collect and how to collect it in ways that preserve privacy and avoid burdening workers. Second, we examine how workers and advocates could use collected data to strengthen individual and collective advocacy efforts. Our qualitative study with 11 workers and 15 advocates highlights tensions between workers' desires for individual and immediate benefits and advocates' preferences to prioritize more collective and long-term benefits. We also uncover discrepancies between participants' expectations for how data might transform advocacy and their on-the-ground experiences collecting and using real data. Finally, we discuss future directions for data-driven worker advocacy, including combining different kinds of data to ameliorate challenges, leveraging advocates as data stewards, and accounting for workers' and organizations' heterogeneous goals.</description>

      <title>Advancing Trustworthy AI for Sustainable Development: Recommendations for Standardising AI Incident Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of AI technologies has led to increasing AI incidents, posing risks and causing harm to individuals, organizations, and society. This study recognizes and addresses the lack of standardized protocols for reliably and comprehensively gathering such incident data crucial for preventing future incidents and developing mitigating strategies. Specifically, this study analyses existing open-access AI-incident databases through a systematic methodology and identifies nine gaps in current AI incident reporting practices. Further, it proposes nine actionable recommendations to enhance standardization efforts to address these gaps. Ensuring the trustworthiness of enabling technologies such as AI is necessary for sustainable digital transformation. Our research promotes the development of standards to prevent future AI incidents and promote trustworthy AI, thus facilitating achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Through international cooperation, stakeholders can unlock the transformative potential of AI, enabling a sustainable and inclusive future for all.</description>

      <title>The Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Upper Secondary Mathematics Education Through the Lens of Technology Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use) influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.</description>

      <title>Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14917v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the Hegelian Dialectic for LLMs' self-reflection, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the contradicting points. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed temperature strategy for generation. Our proposed approach is examined to determine its ability to generate novel ideas from an initial proposition. Additionally, a Multi Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy is leveraged to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves beneficial in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments show promise in generating new ideas and provide a stepping stone for future research.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for Efficient Information Seeking in Goal-Oriented Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to identify and acquire missing information is a critical component of effective decision making and problem solving. With the rise of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems, strategically formulating information-seeking questions becomes crucial and demands efficient methods to guide the search process. We introduce a novel approach to adaptive question-asking through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) for generating questions that maximize information gain, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing and leveraging a decision tree across multiple samples, and a hierarchical feedback mechanism to learn from past interactions. We present two key innovations: (1) an adaptive MCTS algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation for efficient search over potential questions; and (2) a clustering-based feedback algorithm that leverages prior experience to guide future interactions. Each incoming sample is assigned to a cluster based on its semantic similarity with previously observed samples. Our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation selects optimal questions by combining expected rewards, a function of information gain, with a cluster-specific bonus that decays with depth, to emphasize the importance of early-stage questions that have proven effective for narrowing the solution space in similar samples. Experiments across three domains, including medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, demonstrate that our method leads to an average of 12% improvement in success rates and a 10x reduction in the average number of LLM calls made per conversation for the search process, in comparison to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</description>

      <title>Into the Void: Mapping the Unseen Gaps in High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pipeline, augmented by a visual analytics system named ``GapMiner'', that is aimed at exploring and exploiting untapped opportunities within the empty areas of high-dimensional datasets. Our approach begins with an initial dataset and then uses a novel Empty Space Search Algorithm (ESA) to identify the center points of these uncharted voids, which are regarded as reservoirs containing potentially valuable novel configurations. Initially, this process is guided by user interactions facilitated by GapMiner. GapMiner visualizes the Empty Space Configurations (ESC) identified by the search within the context of the data, enabling domain experts to explore and adjust ESCs using a linked parallel-coordinate display. These interactions enhance the dataset and contribute to the iterative training of a connected deep neural network (DNN). As the DNN trains, it gradually assumes the task of identifying high-potential ESCs, diminishing the need for direct user involvement. Ultimately, once the DNN achieves adequate accuracy, it autonomously guides the exploration of optimal configurations by predicting performance and refining configurations, using a combination of gradient ascent and improved empty-space searches. Domain users were actively engaged throughout the development of our system. Our findings demonstrate that our methodology consistently produces substantially superior novel configurations compared to conventional randomization-based methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through several case studies addressing various objectives, including parameter optimization, adversarial learning, and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach that combines Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL RL) with principles derived from music theory to facilitate real-time generation of musical compositions. HITL RL, previously employed in diverse applications such as modelling humanoid robot mechanics and enhancing language models, harnesses human feedback to refine the training process. In this study, we develop a HILT RL framework that can leverage the constraints and principles in music theory. In particular, we propose an episodic tabular Q-learning algorithm with an epsilon-greedy exploration policy. The system generates musical tracks (compositions), continuously enhancing its quality through iterative human-in-the-loop feedback. The reward function for this process is the subjective musical taste of the user.</description>

      <title>Blissful (A)Ignorance: People form overly positive impressions of others based on their written messages, despite wide-scale adoption of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools becomes more prevalent in interpersonal communication, understanding their impact on social perceptions is crucial. According to signaling theory, GenAI may undermine the credibility of social signals conveyed in writing, since it reduces the cost of writing and makes it hard to verify the authenticity of messages. Using a pre-registered large-scale online experiment (N = 647; Prolific), featuring scenarios in a range of communication contexts (personal vs. professional; close others vs. strangers), we explored how senders' use of GenAI influenced recipients' impressions of senders, both when GenAI use was known or uncertain. Consistent with past work, we found strong negative effects on social impressions when disclosing that a message was AI-generated, compared to when the same message was human-written. However, under the more realistic condition when potential GenAI use was not explicitly highlighted, recipients did not exhibit any skepticism towards senders, and these "uninformed" impressions were virtually indistinguishable from those of fully human-written messages. Even when we highlighted the potential (but uncertain) use of GenAI, recipients formed overly positive impressions. These results are especially striking given that 46% of our sample admitted having used such tools for writing messages, just within the past two weeks. Our findings put past work in a new light: While social judgments can be substantially affected when GenAI use is explicitly disclosed, this information may not be readily available in more realistic communication settings, making recipients blissfully ignorant about others' potential use of GenAI.</description>

      <title>AI Agents for Computer Use: A Review of Instruction-based Computer Control, GUI Automation, and Operator Assistants</title>

Abstract: Instruction-based computer control agents (CCAs) execute complex action sequences on personal computers or mobile devices to fulfill tasks using the same graphical user interfaces as a human user would, provided instructions in natural language. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.</description>

      <title>Peer Recommendation Interventions for Health-related Social Support: a Feasibility Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online health communities (OHCs) offer the promise of connecting with supportive peers. Forming these connections first requires finding relevant peers - a process that can be time-consuming. Peer recommendation systems are a computational approach to make finding peers easier during a health journey. By encouraging OHC users to alter their online social networks, peer recommendations could increase available support. But these benefits are hypothetical and based on mixed, observational evidence. To experimentally evaluate the effect of peer recommendations, we conceptualize these systems as health interventions designed to increase specific beneficial connection behaviors. In this paper, we designed a peer recommendation intervention to increase two behaviors: reading about peer experiences and interacting with peers. We conducted an initial feasibility assessment of this intervention by conducting a 12-week field study in which 79 users of CaringBridge received weekly peer recommendations via email. Our results support the usefulness and demand for peer recommendation and suggest benefits to evaluating larger peer recommendation interventions. Our contributions include practical guidance on the development and evaluation of peer recommendation interventions for OHCs.</description>

      <title>M3D: Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution for Non-Deep Transfer Learning in Cross-subject and Cross-session EEG-based Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion decoding using Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) plays a crucial role in affective computing but is limited by challenges such as EEG's non-stationarity, individual variability, and the high cost of large labeled datasets. While deep learning methods are effective, they require extensive computational resources and large data volumes, limiting their practical application. To overcome these issues, we propose Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution (M3D), a lightweight, non-deep transfer learning framework. M3D consists of four key modules: manifold feature transformation, dynamic distribution alignment, classifier learning, and ensemble learning. The data is mapped to an optimal Grassmann manifold space, enabling dynamic alignment of source and target domains. This alignment is designed to prioritize both marginal and conditional distributions, improving adaptation efficiency across diverse datasets. In classifier learning, the principle of structural risk minimization is applied to build robust classification models. Additionally, dynamic distribution alignment iteratively refines the classifier. The ensemble learning module aggregates classifiers from different optimization stages to leverage diversity and enhance prediction accuracy. M3D is evaluated on two EEG emotion recognition datasets using two validation protocols (cross-subject single-session and cross-subject cross-session) and a clinical EEG dataset for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Experimental results show that M3D outperforms traditional non-deep learning methods with a 4.47% average improvement and achieves deep learning-level performance with reduced data and computational requirements, demonstrating its potential for real-world aBCI applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we bridge algorithmic and AI art by adding functionality to the creative coding environment. We create two systems that demonstrate how AI features can enhance algorithmic art and, conversely, how AI art can be styled based on algorithmically-generated artifacts. The first library, GenP5, extends p5.js to allow the artist to apply diffusion models to style and 'condition' their algorithmically-constructed art. The second, P52Style, can learn the 'style' of an algorithmically generated artifact and apply that when creating new AI art.</description>

Abstract: The effectiveness of automatic evaluation of generative models is typically measured by comparing the labels generated via automation with labels by humans using correlation metrics. However, metrics like Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and Randolph's $\kappa$ were originally designed to measure the reliability of human labeling, thus make assumptions about typical human labeling behavior, and these assumptions may not be applicable to machine generated labels. In this paper, we show how *relying on a single aggregate correlation score* can obscure fundamental differences between human labels and those from automatic evaluation, including LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the proportion of samples with variation or uncertainty in human assigned labels is relatively high, machine labels (generated by automatic evaluation methods) may superficially appear to have similar or better correlation with the human majority label compared to the human-to-human (HH) correlation. This can create the illusion that labels from automatic evaluation approximates the human majority label. However, as the proportion of samples with consistent human labels increases, the correlation between machine and human labels fall well below HH correlation. Based on these findings, we first propose stratifying data by human label uncertainty to provide a more robust analysis of automatic evaluation performance. Second, recognizing that uncertainty and variation are inherent in perception-based human evaluations, such as those involving attitudes or preferences, we introduce a new metric - binned Jensen-Shannon Divergence for perception for such scenarios to better measure the effectiveness of automatic evaluations. We present visualization techniques -- perception charts, to contextualize correlation measures appropriately.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues its ballistic trajectory, everything from text to audio, image, and video generation continues to improve at mimicking human-generated content. Through a series of perceptual studies, we report on the realism of AI-generated voices in terms of identity matching and naturalness. We find human participants cannot consistently identify recordings of AI-generated voices. Specifically, participants perceived the identity of an AI-voice to be the same as its real counterpart approximately 80% of the time, and correctly identified a voice as AI generated only about 60% of the time.</description>

      <title>Thermal Comfort in Sight: Thermal Affordance and its Visual Assessment for Sustainable Streetscape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to climate change and urban heat island effects, enhancing human thermal comfort in cities is crucial for sustainable urban development. Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalizes the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance -- VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments.</description>

      <title>Adanonymizer: Interactively Navigating and Balancing the Duality of Privacy and Output Performance in Human-LLM Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot support users to precisely balance privacy protection and output performance during individual consultations. We introduce Adanonymizer, an anonymization plug-in that allows users to control this balance by navigating a trade-off curve. A survey (N=221) revealed a privacy paradox, where users frequently disclosed sensitive information despite acknowledging privacy risks. The study further demonstrated that privacy risks were not significantly correlated with model output performance, highlighting the potential to navigate this trade-off. Adanonymizer normalizes privacy and utility ratings by type and automates the pseudonymization of sensitive terms based on user preferences, significantly reducing user effort. Its 2D color palette interface visualizes the privacy-utility trade-off, allowing users to adjust the balance by manipulating a point. An evaluation (N=36) compared Adanonymizer with ablation methods and differential privacy techniques, where Adanonymizer significantly reduced modification time, achieved better perceived model performance and overall user preference.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of AI Companionship: A Taxonomy of Harmful Algorithmic Behaviors in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As conversational AI systems increasingly permeate the socio-emotional realms of human life, they bring both benefits and risks to individuals and society. Despite extensive research on detecting and categorizing harms in AI systems, less is known about the harms that arise from social interactions with AI chatbots. Through a mixed-methods analysis of 35,390 conversation excerpts shared on r/replika, an online community for users of the AI companion Replika, we identified six categories of harmful behaviors exhibited by the chatbot: relational transgression, verbal abuse and hate, self-inflicted harm, harassment and violence, mis/disinformation, and privacy violations. The AI contributes to these harms through four distinct roles: perpetrator, instigator, facilitator, and enabler. Our findings highlight the relational harms of AI chatbots and the danger of algorithmic compliance, enhancing the understanding of AI harms in socio-emotional interactions. We also provide suggestions for designing ethical and responsible AI systems that prioritize user safety and well-being.</description>

      <title>Keeping Score: A Quantitative Analysis of How the CHI Community Appreciates Its Milestones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ACM CHI Conference has a tradition of citing its intellectual heritage. At the same time, we know CHI is highly diverse and evolving. In this highly dynamic context, it is not clear how the CHI community continues to appreciate its milestones (within and outside of CHI). We present an investigation into how the community's citations to milestones have evolved over 43 years of CHI Proceedings (1981-2024). Forgetting curves plotted for each year suggest that milestones are slowly fading from the CHI community's collective memory. However, the picture is more nuanced when we trace citations to the top-cited milestones over time. We identify three distinct types of milestones cited at CHI, a typology of milestone contributions, and define the Milestone Coefficient as a metric to assess the impact of milestone papers on a continuous scale. Further, we provide empirical evidence of a Matthew effect at CHI. We discuss the broader ramifications for the CHI community and the field of HCI.</description>

      <title>Breaking Barriers or Building Dependency? Exploring Team-LLM Collaboration in AI-infused Classroom Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classroom debates are a unique form of collaborative learning characterized by fast-paced, high-intensity interactions that foster critical thinking and teamwork. Despite the recognized importance of debates, the role of AI tools, particularly LLM-based systems, in supporting this dynamic learning environment has been under-explored in HCI. This study addresses this opportunity by investigating the integration of LLM-based AI into real-time classroom debates. Over four weeks, 22 students in a Design History course participated in three rounds of debates with support from ChatGPT. The findings reveal how learners prompted the AI to offer insights, collaboratively processed its outputs, and divided labor in team-AI interactions. The study also surfaces key advantages of AI usage, reducing social anxiety, breaking communication barriers, and providing scaffolding for novices, alongside risks, such as information overload and cognitive dependency, which could limit learners' autonomy. We thereby discuss a set of nuanced implications for future HCI exploration.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Multimodal Interfaces: A Survey and Taxonomy for Enhanced Context-Aware System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent surge in artificial intelligence, particularly in multimodal processing technology, has advanced human-computer interaction, by altering how intelligent systems perceive, understand, and respond to contextual information (i.e., context awareness). Despite such advancements, there is a significant gap in comprehensive reviews examining these advances, especially from a multimodal data perspective, which is crucial for refining system design. This paper addresses a key aspect of this gap by conducting a systematic survey of data modality-driven Vision-based Multimodal Interfaces (VMIs). VMIs are essential for integrating multimodal data, enabling more precise interpretation of user intentions and complex interactions across physical and digital environments. Unlike previous task- or scenario-driven surveys, this study highlights the critical role of the visual modality in processing contextual information and facilitating multimodal interaction. Adopting a design framework moving from the whole to the details and back, it classifies VMIs across dimensions, providing insights for developing effective, context-aware systems.</description>

      <title>KnowAgent: Knowledge-Augmented Planning for LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</description>

      <title>Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use cases, such as automated personal assistants that adapt to the user's unique data and demands. Two key requirements for such assistants are personalization - in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may prefer to always store their personal data locally, on their own computing device. In this application paper, we present a new design and evaluation for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be trained and deployed locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized to the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a combination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions technique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate that this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to better reflect a user's writing style using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g. on a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is what we believe to be the first detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task, and of how different choices of system components - e.g. the use of RAG and of different fine-tuning approaches - impact the system's performance. We also perform an ablation study showing that less than 100 emails are generally sufficient to produce a credible Panza model. We are releasing the full Panza code as well as a new "David" personalized email dataset licensed for research use, both available on https://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.</description>

      <title>Community Fact-Checks Trigger Moral Outrage in Replies to Misleading Posts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Displaying community fact-checks is a promising approach to reduce engagement with misinformation on social media. However, how users respond to misleading content emotionally after community fact-checks are displayed on posts is unclear. Here, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally analyze changes in sentiments and (moral) emotions in replies to misleading posts following the display of community fact-checks. Our evaluation is based on a large-scale panel dataset comprising N=2,225,260 replies across 1841 source posts from X's Community Notes platform. We find that informing users about falsehoods through community fact-checks significantly increases negativity (by 7.3%), anger (by 13.2%), disgust (by 4.7%), and moral outrage (by 16.0%) in the corresponding replies. These results indicate that users perceive spreading misinformation as a violation of social norms and that those who spread misinformation should expect negative reactions once their content is debunked. We derive important implications for the design of community-based fact-checking systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VR-Doh, a hands-on 3D modeling system that enables intuitive creation and manipulation of elastoplastic objects in Virtual Reality (VR). By customizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of hand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for seamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling experience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both contact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions. To achieve real-time performance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques, particle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and appearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh supports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such as designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting in simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced participants highlights the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and creative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh offers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful tool for creative exploration in VR.</description>

      <title>TelePreview: A User-Friendly Teleoperation System with Virtual Arm Assistance for Enhanced Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleoperation provides an effective way to collect robot data, which is crucial for learning from demonstrations. In this field, teleoperation faces several key challenges: user-friendliness for new users, safety assurance, and transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation. To address these limitations, we introduce TelePreview. This teleoperation system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePreview allows the user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly and safely. We demonstrate that it outperforms other teleoperation systems across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its straightforward deployment across diverse robotic platforms. We release our code and a deployment document on our website https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/telepreview/.</description>
