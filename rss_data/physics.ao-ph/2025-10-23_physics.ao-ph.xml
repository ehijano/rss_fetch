      <title>Characterising the properties of the atmospheric emission at Teide Observatory in the 10-20 GHz range with QUIJOTE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QUIJOTE is a CMB experiment composed of two telescopes, QT1 and QT2, located at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. The MFI instrument (2012-2018), installed on QT1, observed the sky at four frequency bands (11, 13, 17, and 19 GHz) with one degree angular resolution. Its successor, MFI2, began operations in 2024 and operates in the same bands. This paper has two main goals: first, to characterise the atmospheric conditions at Teide Observatory to improve existing models at these frequencies, and second, to empirically characterise atmospheric turbulence using QUIJOTE MFI and MFI2 observations. This work has implications for both atmospheric physics and CMB studies and can support future reanalyses of MFI data or the preparation of upcoming instruments such as the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer. We used data from GPS antennas, the STELLA observatory, and radio soundings to derive median profiles and distributions of key atmospheric parameters for 2012-2018. MFI data were analysed to compute atmospheric structure functions at 17 and 19 GHz and to study the correlation properties of the atmospheric signal through cross-correlation between horns at the same frequency. MFI2 observations were used to estimate the atmospheric power spectrum and compare it with the structure function derived from MFI data. The water vapour density profile follows an exponential decay with a characteristic half-height of about 1000 m. Median PWV in 2012-2018 is 3.3 mm. For high PWV conditions, the structure function agrees with the Kolmogorov turbulence model. The slope of the power spectrum also matches the model prediction, within the frequency range limited by the outer scale and instrument noise. Finally, from the correlation function, we find that atmospheric conditions remain stable for about 1-2 hours.</description>

      <title>Projecting Hurricane Risk in Atlantic Canada under Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atlantic Canada faces significant hurricane threats from damaging winds and coastal flooding that are projected to intensify under climate change. This study adopts a two-stage framework. First, the evolution of wind and coastal-flood hazards is quantified from a historical baseline (1979-2014) to two future periods: a near future (2024-2059) and a far future (2060-2095). Hazard fields are constructed from large ensembles of physics-informed synthetic hurricane tracks, and changes are evaluated in return-period wind speeds and in inundation depth and extent, with sea-level rise included for flood projections. The second stage estimates hurricane risk using wind as an operational proxy for total loss, combining the simulated wind fields with exposure data and a vulnerability relationship to compute expected damages. This design clarifies how physical drivers change and how those shifts translate into loss potential without requiring fully coupled compound-loss modeling. Results indicate an intensification of wind extremes and a substantial amplification of coastal inundation, yielding higher wind-proxy risk for many coastal communities. Spatial patterns show a heterogeneous escalation of risk concentrated along exposed shorelines and urban corridors. This comprehensive analysis of both hazard evolution and proxy risk provides decision-ready evidence on where and by how much hurricane losses are likely to grow. The approach clarifies the link between physical drivers and loss potential, ensuring compatibility with standard wind-centric workflows used in engineering and insurance practice.</description>

      <title>Learning Coupled Earth System Dynamics with GraphDOP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between different components of the Earth System (e.g. ocean, atmosphere, land and cryosphere) are a crucial driver of global weather patterns. Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run separate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their interfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components. Accurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific and technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based machine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw satellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or traditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds information from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system into a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture cross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit coupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the capability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a particularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic, mixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe European heat wave of 2022. The results suggest that learning directly from Earth System observations can successfully characterise and propagate cross-component interactions, offering a promising path towards physically consistent end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction with a single model.</description>

      <title>CSU-PCAST: A Dual-Branch Transformer Framework for medium-range ensemble Precipitation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE), balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance for moderate to heavy rainfall.</description>

      <title>Hurdle-IMDL: An Imbalanced Learning Framework for Infrared Rainfall Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model. Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.</description>

      <title>High-resolution ensemble retrieval of cloud properties for all-day based on geostationary satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clouds play a critical role in Earth's hydrological and energy cycles, and accurately representing their properties is essential for effective numerical modeling and weather forecasting. Machine learning methods have been widely used for cloud property retrieval; however, most existing techniques are deterministic and do not incorporate uncertainty quantification. Generative machine learning has made significant advances in various domains, including natural language processing, image generation, and notably weather forecasting, where it has enabled ensemble predictions and the quantification of forecast uncertainty. This ability to quantify uncertainty offers valuable opportunities for cloud remote sensing. In this study, we propose a novel cloud property retrieval method, CloudDiff, based on a generative diffusion model. By leveraging thermal infrared observations from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), CloudDiff generates high spatiotemporal resolution cloud properties for both daytime and nighttime conditions, increasing the resolution of Himawari-8/AHI cloud retrievals from 2 km to 1 km. Unlike deterministic retrieval methods, CloudDiff generates multiple samples from the underlying probability distribution, allowing for a diverse range of plausible retrievals and taking steps towards providing uncertainty assessment. Additionally, CloudDiff produces sharper samples and better captures fine local features, enhancing the precision of cloud property retrieval. By averaging over the ensemble of generated samples, we demonstrate that both the accuracy and reliability of the retrievals are significantly improved. These high-resolution cloud properties have been successfully applied to analyze extreme weather events, such as typhoons, providing potentially valuable insights into atmospheric processes.</description>
