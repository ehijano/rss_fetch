      <title>Strongly interacting bosons in 1D disordered lattice: phase coherence of distorted Mott phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of disorder on phase coherence in the Mott insulator phases in an optical lattice. Few bosons with contact interaction in small optical lattice can feature varieties of insulating phases: weakly interacting Mott in deep lattice, maximally fragmented and strongly interacting Mott in intermediate lattice, weak Mott with double filling and intra-well coherence, fermionized Mott with strong intra-well coherence. Utilization of the multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) to solve the many-boson Schroedinger equation, facilitates to understand the microscopic effect of disorder on the different kinds of Mott phases in the primary lattice. The many-body properties are analyzed by distinct measures of the reduced one-body density in real and momentum space, fragmentation, order parameter, variance of spatial single-shot measurements, compressibility and the Glauber normalized correlation functions. We find very complex competition of localization due to disorder and Mott correlation. We observe distinct response of four different Mott phases in the disordered lattice. When the weakly interacting Mott exhibits the Bose Glass phase, the strongly correlated and fully fragmented Mott exhibits leakage, melting and central localization. In contrast, weak Mott with double filling which is a spatially separated dimer in each site, exhibits only some dissociation of intra-well coherence and assist in the development of inter-well coherence in the presence of strong disorder. For the fermionized Mott, when the density in each well is fragmented, strong disorder interfere with the intra-well correlation and the characteristic dip in each site starts to disappear leading to simple Mott localization with a pair of bosons.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Lieb excitations and topological flat mode of spectral function of Tonks-Girardeau gas in Kronig-Penney potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lieb excitations are fundamental to the understanding of the low energy behaviour of many-body quantum gases. Here we study the spectral function of a Tonks-Girardeau gas in a finite sized Kronig-Penney potential and show that the Lieb-I and Lieb-II excitations can become gapped as a function of the barrier height. Moreover, we reveal the existence of a topological flat mode near the Fermi energy and at zero momentum and show that this is robust to perturbations in the system. Through a scaling analysis, we determine the divergent behaviour of the spectral function. Our results provide a significant reference for the observation and understanding of the gapped Lieb excitations and the topological flat mode of quantum gases in experimentally realistic subwavelength optical lattice potentials.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves careful labelling of density depletions in absorption images following short time-of-flight expansions, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, often beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We benchmark the performance of our method by comparing it to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the number-conserving unitary dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and argue that an analogue gravity model in such a setting must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This in turn requires that one expands to second order in perturbations, and takes the nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that this leads to significant modifications of the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh metric and, to subleading order, two emergent vector fields. Both the renormalized metric and the vector fields then keep track of the effect of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to quantum many-body backreaction.</description>

      <title>Observation of string-breaking dynamics in a quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous particle-pair formation is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. It can, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles increases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond a critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to break. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in high-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string evolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern physics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to outperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental capabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been demonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally probe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a (1+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges and strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array of tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how confinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without string tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased. Then, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string stretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string tension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk, revealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional Schwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have achieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may ultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>
