      <title>The Veronese Geometry of Dziobek Configurations and Generic Finiteness for Homogeneous Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is the proof of the generic finiteness of Dziobek central configurations for a homogeneous potential and the derivation of a uniform upper bound for their number. By exploiting the isomorphism between the Veronese variety and the determinantal variety associated with the Dziobek conditions, we define the Dziobek-Veronese variety and apply the dimension of fibers theorem to analyze the projection from the space of configurations and masses to the space of masses. We prove that the fibers of this projection, representing the central configurations for a given mass vector, are finite for masses chosen outside a proper algebraic subvariety. Furthermore, we utilize that the Dziobek variety is defined by an intersection of quadrics to obtain a bound of Bezout type for the number of Dziobek configurations with fixed masses given by a power of $2$ with exponent quadratic in $n$. Unlike previous estimates tailored to specific potentials, this bound depends solely on the dimension $n$. For instance, for the four-body problem, our bound reduces to $8192$, which is lower than the bound of $8472$ established by Moeckel and Hampton. This suggests that the complexity of counting Dziobek configurations for generic masses is governed primarily by the ambient geometry of the configuration space, rather than by the non-linearity of the interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Trimmed strong laws and distributional limits for exponentially mixing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem establishes pointwise convergence for integrable observables, but for $f\notin L^1$, no normalization yields almost sure convergence. This paper investigates trimmed ergodic sums, where the largest observations are removed, for observables with polynomial tails $\P(f&gt;t)\asymp t^{-1/\alpha}$ in exponentially mixing dynamical systems. We prove trimmed strong laws of large numbers when $\alpha\geq 1$, extending known results from the i.i.d.\ case. Moreover, we establish distributional limit theorems for both lightly and intermediately trimmed sums in the regime $\alpha&gt;1/2$, showing convergence to a non-standard law, which we describe explicitly, and a normal distribution, respectively. The proofs rely on approximating the trimmed sums by truncated ergodic sums and exploiting the system's exponential mixing properties.</description>

      <title>Determining the Winner in Alternating-Move Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba{\'n}ski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>

      <title>Shadowing and the continuity of omega-limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between shadowing phenomena and the continuity properties of $\omega$-limit sets in dynamical systems. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a shadowable point to be an upper (resp. a lower) semicontinuity point of $\omega$-limit sets. Assuming global shadowing, we show that the lower semicontinuity of $\omega$-limit sets is equivalent to the chain continuity. We also show that the lower semicontinuity of $\omega$-limit sets is equivalent to the chain continuity in a general setting. Several examples are given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A dynamical model of the U.S. mathematics graduate degree pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a latent-stock compartmental framework for modeling degree production systems when only completion flows, rather than enrollments, are observed. Applied to U.S.\ mathematics degrees from 1969 to 2017, the model treats master's and PhD populations as latent compartments -- unobserved state variables that are inferred indirectly because they generate the observed completion flows -- with time-varying routing fractions and completion hazards. Using information-criterion model comparison across a grid of specifications, we find strong support for smooth nonlinear time variation in routing fractions and hazards, while models with explicit international forcing are disfavored. The preferred model achieves a log-scale root mean squared error of approximately 0.036, corresponding to a typical multiplicative error of about 4\% in fitted degree counts, and highlights key structural shifts in the graduate pipeline: the master's pathway became increasingly central to PhD production through the late twentieth century before weakening, while direct bachelor's-to-PhD entry remained small but persistent. Estimated completion hazards for both degrees rise over time, indicating faster effective turnover in the graduate compartments. Methodologically, our main contribution is a latent stock dynamical approach that recasts linked degreecompletion time series as a coherent stock-flow system when intermediate enrollments are unobserved, making explicit both what features of pipeline dynamics are identifiable from completion data alone and what limitations such data impose.</description>

      <title>Deformation and perturbative rigidity near de la Llave examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De la Llave's examples are Anosov diffeomorphisms on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with constant Lyapunov spectrum, yet they are not $C^{1}$-conjugate to the linear model or to each other. Nevertheless, we show that such examples are ``locally exceptional'': we prove deformation and local rigidity for generic diffeomorphisms in proximity of de la Llave's examples.</description>

      <title>Path Connectivity of Anosov Metrics on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of Riemannian metrics in closed surfaces of genus greater than one, having Anosov geodesic flows, and some regions of positive curvature, such that for each such surface, there exists a smooth curve of conformal deformations that preserves the Anosov property and connects the surface with a Riemannian metric of negative curvature. The conformal deformation does not arise from geometric flows like the Ricci flow, since it is known that such flows might generate conjugate points in the presence of points of positive curvature in the surface.</description>

      <title>Extinction in Reaction Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study extinction in dynamical systems generated by reaction networks. We introduce two notions: weak extinction and strong extinction, and relate them to the structure of the underlying network through Lyapunov functions and LaSalle's invariance principle. In particular, for all deficiency-zero networks that are not weakly reversible, we provide a geometric construction of linear Lyapunov functions. Using these functions, we establish that if these networks have bounded invariant subspaces, then they must exhibit weak extinction within every such subspace. Also, for linear networks that are not weakly reversible, we show that every species outside a terminal strongly connected component undergoes strong extinction. Moreover, in order to further emphasize the difference between weak and strong extinction, we construct an example of a reaction system (based on the Ivanova network) that exhibits weak extinction for all the species, but does not exhibit strong extinction in any species.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents versus Integrability in Random Conservative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random dynamical systems generated by volume-preserving piecewise $C^{1}$ maps. For this class of random systems, we establish an invariance principle asserting that if the Lyapunov exponents vanish, then there exists a measurable family of probability measures on the projective bundle that is invariant under the projective cocycle induced by the derivative. We apply this principle to two classes of random systems. First, we study random additive perturbations of a single billiard map associated with a strictly convex planar table on a surface of constant curvature. In this setting, we prove that the Lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere if and only if the billiard table is a geodesic disk. Second, we consider random additive perturbations of a single standard map and show that the Lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere if and only if the standard map is integrable.</description>

      <title>Non-local planelike minimizers and $\Gamma$-convergence of periodic energies to a local anisotropic perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem related to a non-local interface energy with a periodic forcing term. We show the existence of planelike minimizers for such energy. Moreover, we prove that, under suitable assumptions on the non-local kernel and the external field, the sequence of rescaled energies $\Gamma$-converges to a suitable local anisotropic perimeter, where the anisotropy is defined as the limit of the normalized energy of a planelike minimizer in larger and larger cubes (i.e., what is called in jargon "stable norm"). To obtain this, we also establish several auxiliary results, including: the minimality of the level sets of the minimizers, explicit bounds on the oscillations of the minimizers, density estimates for almost minimizers, and non-local perimeter estimates in the large.</description>

      <title>Filament Pairs, Dynamic Partitions, and Spiders for Post-Singularly Finite Entire Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filaments are a natural generalization of the well-known concept of dynamic rays in complex dynamics. In this article we investigate which periodic or preperiodic filaments land together for arbitrary post-singularly finite transcendental entire functions. Our first main result is a combinatorial description of the landing relation of filaments in terms of the dynamic partitions of the space of external addresses. One of the main difficulties deals with taming the more complicated topology of filaments. In the end, filaments possess all the topological properties of dynamic rays that are essential for the construction of dynamic partitions. The results of this paper are the foundation for the development of combinatorial models, in particular homotopy Hubbard trees, for arbitrary post-singularly finite transcendental entire functions.
  Our second mail result is that every postsingularly finite entire function has an iterated that possesses and invariant spider: spiders are, like homotopy Hubbard trees, an important tool for the combinatorial classification of postsingularly finite polynomials and presumably also for entire functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\varphi_0$ be a $C^2$-conservative diffeomorphism of a compact surface $S$ and let $\Lambda_0$ be a mixing horseshoe of $\varphi_0$. Given a smooth real function $f$ defined in $S$ and some diffeomorphism $\varphi$, close to $\varphi_0$, let $\mathcal{L}_{\varphi, f}$ be the Lagrange spectrum associated to the hyperbolic continuation $\Lambda(\varphi)$ of the horseshoe $\Lambda_0$ and $f$. We show that, for generic choices of $\varphi$ and $f$, if $L_{\varphi, f}$ is the map that gives the Hausdorff dimension of the set $\mathcal{L}_{\varphi, f}\cap (-\infty, t)$ for $t\in \mathbb{R}$, then there are at most two points that can be limit of a infinite sequence of discontinuities of $L_{\varphi, f}$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for unique codings of fat Sierpinski gaskets with multiple digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $M\ge 1$ and $\beta\in(1, M+1)$, let $S_{\beta, M}$ be the fat Sierpinski gasket in $\mathbb R^2$ generated by the iterated function system $\left\{f_d(x)=\frac{x+d}{\beta}: d\in\Omega_M\right\}$, where $\Omega_M=\{(i,j)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^2: i+j\le M\}$. Then each $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ may be represented as a series $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{\beta^i}=:\Pi_\beta((d_i))$, and the infinite sequence $(d_i)\in\Omega_M^{\mathbb N}$ is called a \emph{coding} of $x$. Since $\beta&lt;M+1$, a point in $S_{\beta, M}$ may have multiple codings. Let $U_{\beta, M}$ be the set of $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ having a unique coding, that is \[ U_{\beta, M}=\left\{x\in S_{\beta, M}: \#\Pi_\beta^{-1}(x)=1\right\}. \] When $M=1$, Kong and Li [2020, Nonlinearity] described two critical bases for the phase transitions of the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde U_{\beta, 1}$, which is a subset of $U_{\beta, 1}$. In this paper we consider $M\ge 2$, and characterize the two critical bases $\beta_G(M)$ and $\beta_c(M)$ for the phase transitions of $U_{\beta, M}$: (i) if $\beta\in(1, \beta_G(M)]$, then $U_{\beta, M}$ is finite; (ii) if $\beta\in(\beta_G(M), \beta_c(M))$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is countably infinite; (iii) if $\beta=\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is uncountable and has zero Hausdorff dimension; (iv) if $\beta&gt;\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our results can also be applied to the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde{U}_{\beta, M}$. Moreover, we show that the first critical base $\beta_G(M)$ is a Perron number, while the second critical base $\beta_c(M)$ is a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and stability of stationary shear flows of Ericksen-Leslie model for nematic liquid crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, focusing on a critical case for shear flows of nematic liquid crystals, we investigate multiplicity and stability of stationary solutions via the parabolic Ericksen-Leslie system. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of the stationary solutions with the set of the solutions of an algebraic equation for a cusp case. This one-to-one correspondence is established essentially based on the treatment in the work of Jiao, et. al. [{\em J. Diff. Dyn. Syst. {\bf 34} (2022), 239-269}] for a different case, and the relation gives directly parameter ranges for existence of multiple stationary solutions; in particular, multiple stationary solutions are created through countably many saddle-node bifurcations for the algebraic equation at critical shear speeds. The main result of the paper is on the stability of stationary solutions associated to the bifurcations; more precisely, (i) for each critical shear speed, there is a unique stationary solution and, for smaller shear speed, the stationary solution disappears but, for larger shear speed, two stationary solutions nearby bifurcate; (ii) more importantly, under a generic condition, there is a simple zero eigenvalue for the linearization of the shear flow at the critical stationary solution and, for larger shear speed, the zero eigenvalue bifurcates to a negative eigenvalue for one of the two stationary solutions and to a positive eigenvalue for the other stationary solution.</description>

      <title>Universal Analog Computation: Fra\"iss\'e Limits of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog computation is an alternative to digital computation, that has recently re-gained prominence, since it includes neural networks and neuromorphic computing. Further important examples are cellular automata and differential analyzers. While analog computers offer many advantages, they lack a notion of universality akin to universal digital computers. Since analog computers are best formalized as dynamical systems, we review scattered results on universal dynamical systems. We identify four senses of universality and connect to the two main general theories of computation: coalgebra and domain theory. For nondeterministic systems, we construct a universal system as a Fra\"iss\'e limit. It not only is universal in many of the identified senses, it also is unique in additionally being homogeneous. For deterministic systems, a universal system cannot exist, but we provide a simple method for constructing subclasses of deterministic systems with a universal and homogeneous system. This way, we introduce sofic proshifts: those systems that are limits of sofic shifts. In fact, their universal and homogeneous system even is a limit of shifts of finite type and has the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent nonautonomous 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise and subject to almost periodic external forcing. Owing to the distribution-dependent structure and the almost periodicity of the external forcing, the resulting solution process becomes an inhomogeneous Markov process, presenting significant analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we propose sufficient conditions on the time-dependent external forcing and distribution-dependent nonlinear terms, and develop novel analytical estimates. As a result, we establish the existence and uniqueness of uniform measure attractors for the system. Notably, the joint continuity of the family of processes is achieved without relying on the Feller property of $\{P^{(g,h)}{(\tau,t)}\}_{\tau\leq t}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the classical continuous system initially proposed by Bailey in 1975, we present a novel Susceptible--Infected--Removed (SIR) model defined in quantum time, where the temporal evolution is governed by a non-uniform time grid. An explicit analytical solution is derived, and the long-term behavior of the susceptible, infected, and removed individuals is analyzed. Moreover, we prove the model preserves dynamic consistency with its continuous counterpart, as evidenced by the non-negativity of solutions and their corresponding qualitative agreement with the continuous dynamics. All results are further supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Does $\mathcal P(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$ know its right hand from its left?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ denote the shift automorphism on $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$, defined by setting $\sigma([A]) = [A+1]$ for all $A \subseteq \omega$. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies the shift automorphism $\sigma$ and its inverse $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate in the automorphism group of $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$.
  Due to work of van Douwen and Shelah, it has been known since the 1980's that it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are not conjugate. Our result shows that the question of whether $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$.
  As a corollary to the main theorem, we deduce that the structures $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma \rangle$ and $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma^{-1} \rangle$ are elementarily equivalent in the language of algebraic dynamical systems (Boolean algebras together with an automorphism). This corollary does not depend on the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving space discretization of differential and nonlocal constitutive relations for port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure-preserving space discretization of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems defined with differential constitutive relations. Using the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a structure-preserving Finite Element Method.
  To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports naturally occur.
  Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system. Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Perturbing and $C^*$-algebra Lifting Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate morphisms have seen significant study across many areas of mathematics, for instance, in the theory of Absolute (Neighborhood) Retracts in topology, or of almost-commuting unitary matrices in analysis. This paper initiates study of a type of approximate group action (which we call almost-actions). More precisely, these are sequences of set maps from a group into the homeomorphisms of a compact metric space which are asymptotically multiplicative in the sense of the metric. We prove a kind of topological stability holds in certain cases, such as when the group is finite and the space is a Cantor set, so that one can find genuine actions near the almost-actions, and apply these results to produce new finite approximations of many actions by virtually free groups on Cantor sets. We also introduce a new type of lifting problem for $C^*$-algebras which, rather than asking for a lift of a homomorphism, asks for a lift of the structure of a Cartan pair, and use this new notion to characterize the stability of more general almost-actions. In the course of attempting to apply the theory of semiprojective $C^*$-algebras to these questions, we define a notion of conditional semiprojectivity for morphisms of $C^*$-algebras. We show that maps of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras are conditionally semiprojective, but that the inclusion of $C(S^1)$ into $C(S^1)\rtimes \Gamma$ (for any non-trivial action of a finite group $\Gamma$) is not. We conclude with a conjecture about the general stability of almost-actions by finite groups and some commentary on possible directions for further developing these ideas.</description>
