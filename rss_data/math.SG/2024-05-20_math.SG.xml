      <title>A dual pair for the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use cotangent bundles of spaces of smooth embeddings to construct symplectic dual pairs involving the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Via symplectic reduction we obtain descriptions of coadjoint orbits of this group in terms of nonlinear Grassmannians of augmented submanifolds. For codimension one embeddings these submanifolds are further constrained to the leaves of isodrastic foliations with finite codimensions.</description>

      <title>Wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plumbing spaces have drawn significant attention among symplectic topologists due to their natural occurrence as examples of Weinstein manifolds. In our paper, we provide a general formula for the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings (with arbitrary grading structure) of cotangent bundles along any quiver. Our approach relies on "local-to-global" computations. Specifically, we compute the wrapped Fukaya category of "plumbing sectors" that serve as local models for the singularities of Lagrangian skeletons of plumbing spaces. As corollaries, we fully describe the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbing spaces in dimension $4$ and plumbings of $T^*S^n$ for $n \geq 3$. We show that any Ginzburg dg algebra/category of a graded quiver without potential is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a plumbing of $T^*S^n$ (with the corresponding grading structure).</description>

      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Symplectic embeddings of toric domains with boundary a lens space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial description of the embedded contact complex (ECC) of a certain family of contact toric lens spaces that we call concave lens spaces. We also define a notion of a concave toric domain that generalizes the usual concave toric domain in a way that possesses a singularity point and has a boundary a lens space. After desingularization these toric domains include the unitary cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the unitary cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}P^2$. We use the combinatorial expression of the ECC to compute the ECH capacities of these toric domains. Furthermore, for certain concave toric domains we describe a packing of symplectic manifolds that recovers their ECH capacities.</description>
