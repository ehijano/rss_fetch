      <title>Hecke categories, idempotents, and commuting stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a connection between a topological and a geometric category. The former is the idempotent completion of the (horizontal) trace of the affine Hecke category, while the latter is the equivariant derived category of the (semi-nilpotent) commuting stack. This provides a more precise and improved version of our proposal in [8].</description>

      <title>The Fibonacci Space-Filling Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can you stretch and reform a curve such that it fills a square completely? This question dates back to 18th century, the origin of space-filling curves. It was proved affirmatively by many great mathematicians. In this document, we reconsider the problem and present a different proof using Cartesian product of Fibonacci substitution with itself. Our construction differs from other curves by design.</description>

      <title>Cross-sectional shape analysis for risk assessment and prognosis of patients with true lumen narrowing after type-A aortic dissection surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: For acute type-A aortic dissection (ATAAD) surgery, early post-surgery assessment is crucially important for effective treatment plans, underscoring the need for a framework to identify the risk level of aortic dissection cases. We examined true-lumen narrowing during follow-up examinations, collected morphological data 14 days (early stages) after surgery, and assessed patient risk levels over 2.8 years.
  Purpose: To establish an implementable framework supported by mathematical techniques to predict the risk of aortic dissection patients experiencing true-lumen narrowing after ATAAD surgery.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed CT data from 21 ATAAD patients. Forty uniformly distributed cross-sectional shapes (CSSs) are derived from each lumen to account for gradual changes in shape. We introduced the form factor (FF) to assess CSS morphology. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for the risk classification of aortic dissection patients. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) is used for risk prediction.
  Results: For this investigation, we examined data of 21 ATAAD patients categorized into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk cases based on clinical observations of the range of true-lumen narrowing. Our risk classification machine-learning (ML) model preserving the model's generalizability. The model's predictions reliably identified low-risk patients, thereby potentially reducing hospital visits. It also demonstrated proficiency in accurately predicting the risk for all high-risk patients.
  Conclusion: The suggested method anticipates the risk linked to aortic enlargement in patients with a narrowing true lumen in the early stage following ATAAD surgery, thereby aiding follow-up doctors in enhancing patient care.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of mapping tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify in terms of Hopf-type properties mapping tori of residually finite Poincar\'e Duality groups with non-zero Euler characteristic. This generalises and gives a new proof of the analogous classification for fibered 3-manifolds. Various applications are given. In particular, we deduce that rigidity results for Gromov hyperbolic groups hold for the above mapping tori with trivial center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13864v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new tools for the construction of fixed point sets in digital topology. We define excludable points and show that these may be excluded from all freezing sets. We show that articulation points are excludable.
  We also present results concerning points that must belong to a freezing set and often are easily recognized. These include points of degree~1 and some local extrema.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic dimension of the grand arc graph is infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a compact, orientable surface, and let $\Gamma$ be a relation on $\pi_0(\partial \Sigma)$ such that the prescribed arc graph $\mathcal{A}(\Sigma,\Gamma)$ is Gromov-hyperbolic and non-trivial. We show that $\text{asdim }\mathcal{A}(\Sigma,\Gamma) \geq -\chi(\Sigma) - 1$, from which we prove that the asymptotic dimension of the grand arc graph is infinite. More generally, we prove that any connected, Gromov-hyperbolic multiarc and curve graph $\mathcal{M}$ preserved by $\text{PMod}(\Sigma)$ with bounded geometric intersection over edges has $\text{asdim }\mathcal{M} \geq g - \lceil\frac{1}{2} \chi(\Sigma)\rceil$, and that a broad class of multiarc and curve graphs on infinite-type surfaces has infinite asymptotic dimension.</description>

      <title>Stated SL(n)-Skein Modules and Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of stated SL(n)-skein modules, $S_n(M,N),$ of 3-manifolds $M$ marked with intervals $N$ in their boundaries. They consist of linear combinations of $n$-webs with ends in $N$, considered up to skein relations inspired by the relations of the Reshetikhin-Turaev theory.
  We prove that cutting $M$ along a disk resulting in a $3$-manifold $M'$ yields a homomorphism $S_n(M)\to S_n(M')$. That result allows to analyze the skein modules of $3$-manifolds through the skein modules of their pieces.
  The theory of stated skein modules is particularly rich for thickened surfaces $M=\Sigma \times (-1,1),$ in whose case, $S_n(M)$ is an algebra, denoted by $S_n(\Sigma).$ We prove that the skein algebra of the ideal bigon is $O_q(SL(n))$ and that it provides simple geometric interpretations of the product, coproduct, counit, the antipode, and the cobraided structure on $O_q(SL(n)).$
  Additionally, we show that a splitting of a thickened bigon near a marking defines a $O_q(SL(n))$-comodule structure on $S_n(M),$ or dually, an $U_q(sl_n)$-module structure. Furthermore, we show that the skein algebra of surfaces $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$ glued along two sides of a triangle is isomorphic with the braided tensor product $S_n(\Sigma_1)\underline{\otimes} S_n(\Sigma_2)$ of Majid. These results allow for a geometric interpretation of further concepts in the theory of quantum groups, for example, of the braided products and of Majid's transmutation operation.
  We prove that the factorization homology of surfaces with coefficients in $Rep\, U_q(sl_n)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over $S_n(\Sigma)$. We also discuss the relation with the quantum moduli spaces of Alekseev-Schomerus.
  Finally, we show that for surfaces $\Sigma$ with boundary, $S_n(\Sigma)$ is a free module with a basis induced from the Kashiwara-Lusztig canonical bases.</description>
