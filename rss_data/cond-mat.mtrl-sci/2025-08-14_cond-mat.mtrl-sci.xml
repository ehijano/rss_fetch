      <title>Thermal gradient effect on hydrogen transport in tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key challenge for efficiency and safety in fusion devices is the retention of tritium (T) in plasma-facing components. Tritium retention generates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to generate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the main candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a reliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal gradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W. Strong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense energy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical approach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in irreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the presence of thermal gradients. We show that $Q^*$ can be written as a function of temperature, temperature gradient, a characteristic length and the ratio of the rates towards hot and cold regions. Furthermore, we describe how, to first order, the dependence of $Q^*$ on the thermal gradient vanishes, in agreement with MD results. On average, we find $Q^*=-5.41\times 10^{-3}kT^2~\text{eV}$ for H in pure W, with $k$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature.</description>

      <title>Controlled Growth of Bronze Telluride for Scalable Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for sustainable and decentralized energy solutions, thermoelectric energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technology for directly converting waste heat into electricity through solid state, environmentally friendly means. Among copper chalcogenides, Cu2Te is a notable p-type material due to its degenerate semiconducting nature and low thermal conductivity. In this study, we present a sustainable synthesis strategy for Sn-doped Cu2Te referred to as bronze telluride (BT) via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) assisted tellurization process using pre-alloyed Cu Sn (bronze) powder. The resulting BT exhibited an enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 1 at 500 K. To assess practical applicability, BT was integrated with n type galena (PbS) in a cascaded p n thermoelectric module, which generated 2.8 mV across a temperature gradient of 35 K, demonstrating its potential for medium- to high-temperature waste heat recovery. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations and density functional theory (DFT) simulations provided insights into the formation mechanism of Cu2Te and the thermoelectric behaviour of BT. This work introduces an efficient, scalable, and environmentally responsible pathway for developing copper-based thermoelectric materials using industrially relevant precursors.</description>

      <title>Antiferron Modes in Ferroelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of antiferron modes in ferroelectric materials as dynamically stabilized collective excitations over inverted polarization states that decrease the system energy. While ferrons represent quantized oscillations around the stable polarization minimum, antiferrons require dynamic stabilization via high-frequency driving. Using a generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we derive the effective curvature corrections from external driving, demonstrate the conditions for stabilizing metastable wells, and present the quantized Hamiltonian. Antiferrons could be a promising candidate for developing electrical sensing devices, offering tunable, dynamically controllable excitations with high sensitivity to external electric fields.</description>

      <title>Energetically Favored One-Dimensional Moir\'e Superstructure in the Pseudo-Square Lattice GdTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e engineering in layered crystals has recently gained considerable attention due to the discovery of various structural and physical phenomena, including interfacial reconstruction, superconductivity, magnetism, and distinctive optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, most explored moir\'e systems have been limited to hexagonal lattices, thereby constraining a comprehensive understanding and technological application of moir\'e phenomena in general layered crystals. Here, we investigate GdTe3, a pseudo-tetragonal layered crystal, as a platform to explore unconventional moir\'e phenomena. GdTe3 exhibits a slight in-plane distortion correlated with the direction of charge density wave formation. Through vertical stacking of layers with different distortions-induced via a controlled strain/release process-we realize energetically favorable one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superstructures. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution scanning TEM imaging, dark-field TEM imaging, and sample tilting experiments, we systematically examine stacking variations across the 1D moir\'e structure. Additionally, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals modulations in electronic properties associated with the 1D moir\'e structure. Our findings expand the scope of moir\'e systems beyond conventional hexagonal twistronics, enabling exploration of moir\'e phenomena in low-symmetry van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Force-Driven Charge Redistribution for Hydrogen Release at Ambient Conditions in Transition Metal-Intercalated Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal (TM) atom-functionalized nanomaterials are promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their ability to adsorb multiple hydrogen molecules through Kubas interactions. However, achieving efficient hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions remains a critical challenge for practical use. Here, we present a novel approach to modulate the desorption temperature of hydrogen in TM-intercalated bilayer graphene (BLG) using external mechanical forces. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamic occupancy probability calculations, we demonstrate that adjusting the interlayer distance allows for precise control over the interaction energy of H2, thereby facilitating its desorption at ambient conditions. Complete hydrogen desorption occurs when the interlayer distance is reduced below 4.7 {\AA}, 5.3 {\AA}, and 5.1 {\AA} for Sc-, Ti-, and V-intercalated BLG, respectively. Our findings suggest that external mechanical forces can effectively bring hydrogen occupancy to zero by minimizing charge transfer from the TM d-orbitals to H2 antibonding orbitals. Notably, while the total charge transferred from the TM atoms remains nearly constant at varying interlayer distances, its redistribution between the graphene layers and H2 fine-tunes the interaction strength. This approach can be extended to large interlayer distances, as supported by recent experiments on graphene oxide membranes [ACS Nano 12, 9309 (2018)]. Furthermore, recent experimental advances in noble gas and alkali metal intercalation in BLG highlight the potential of this approach to overcome the long-standing challenge of high desorption temperatures in TM-functionalized layered nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Boron Clusters for Metal-Free Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-deficient boron clusters are identified as a fundamentally new class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, entirely free of transition metals. Selective sodium extraction from NaAlB14 and Na2B29 via high-pressure diffusion control introduces hole doping into B12 icosahedral frameworks, resulting in OER activity exceeding that of Co3O4 by more than an order of magnitude, and exceptional durability under alkaline conditions. B12 clusters are known for their superchaotropic character, which destabilizes hydrogen bonding in water. In this system, H2O, instead of OH-, preferentially adsorbs on the catalyst surface, suggesting a distinct OER pathway mediated by molecular water. This adsorption behavior contrasts with conventional transition-metal oxides and reflects the unique interfacial properties of the boron clusters. Density functional theory reveals unoccupied p orbitals and unique local electric fields at the cluster surface, both of which could promote the water activation. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in OER catalysis, in which the unique interaction between B12 clusters and water drives the reaction, replacing the conventional role of redox-active metals. Hole-doped boron clusters thus offer a promising platform for designing high-performance and durable water-splitting catalysts, opening new avenues for OER design beyond conventional transition-metal chemistry.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Synthesis of a Family of Boride Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borides are a rich material family. To push the boundaries of borides' properties and applications into broader fields, we have conducted systematic theoretical and experimental searches for synthesizable phases in ternary borides TM$_2$B$_2$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d transition metals). We find that TM$_2$B$_2$ in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type and CoW$_2$B$_2$-type structures form a large family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we identify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11 altermagnets in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets are rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel T-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin splitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both effects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially constrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of relevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced spin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An iodine-assisted synthesis method for TM$_2$B$_2$ is developed, using which 7 of the predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and characterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides by offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in borides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of altermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing a common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets by elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations.</description>

      <title>Investigating oxides by electrochemical projection of the oxygen off-stoichiometry diagram onto a single sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygen stoichiometry is an essential key to tune functional properties of advanced oxide materials and thus has motivated numerous studies of the oxygen off-stoichiometry diagram, with the aim to determine and control structural, electronic, ionic, electrochemical and optical properties, as well as thermodynamic quantities such as the oxygen storage capacity, among others. Here, a novel approach is developed, which allows to project a broad range of oxygen chemical potentials onto a single thin film sample with unprecedented control via electrochemical polarization. Therefore, a specifically designed electrochemical cell geometry is deployed, resulting in a well-defined, linear, 1D in-plane oxygen concentration gradient, independent of variations in the materials electrical resistivity, whose endpoints can be flexibly controlled via the external pO2 and applied overpotential. This allows for an unparalleled study of materials properties as a continuous function of the oxygen content using spatially resolved tools (spectroscopic, diffraction, microscopy, local electrical probes, etc.) and thereby greatly reduces experimental efforts while also avoiding sample-to-sample variability, multi-step treatments, sample evolution effects, etc. This work presents the proof-of-concept of in-plane oxygen gradients, based on spatially resolved ex/in situ and novel fixed-energy X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray diffraction, ellipsometry and electrical resistivity measurements in hyper-stoichiometric La2NiO4+{\delta} and sub-stoichiometric (La,Sr)FeO3-{\delta} thin films. It thereby demonstrates the readiness and wide applicability of this innovative approach, which can be highly relevant for fundamental as well as applied research.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Aqueous Two-Phase Extraction of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Highly Versatile Nonionic Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of efficient separation methods is essential for the production of fine chemicals and materials. Among them, the aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) allows for the isolation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of specific structures and other substances. However, this easy-to-use method, in which an analyte is partitioned between two phases, still demands a better understanding of its mechanism to make its application more effective. Herein, we demonstrate how various biphasic systems can be formed according to the nature of the phase-forming components. Moreover, by employing polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPEG), previously unrecognized in this context, we reveal the versatility of nonionic polymers for ATPE, which can successfully act as phase-forming compounds, partitioning modulators, and dispersing agents. Interestingly, as proven by experiments and modelling, PEPEG exhibited chirality-sensitive preference toward SWCNTs, which can significantly facilitate the purification of SWCNTs using various approaches. Capitalizing on this finding, we report how the extraction environment may be tailored to promote the isolation of (8,3) SWCNTs and other chirality-enriched SWCNT fractions. The relationships noted, based on the examination of a model material (SWCNTs), provide substantial insight into the elusive mechanism of the ATPE purification approach, widely employed across a range of analytes, from cell organelles to nanostructures</description>

      <title>Colorization of Optically Transparent Surfactants to Track Their Movement in Biphasic Systems Used for Differentiation of Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is a versatile method for the purification of numerous chemical compounds and materials, ranging from proteins and nucleic acids to cell organelles and various nanostructures. However, despite its widespread use, the underlying extraction mechanism remains unclear, which significantly reduces the utility of ATPE. Many types of surfactants are often added to biphasic systems to enhance the extraction of analytes between phases. Although their role in this process is crucial, it is not entirely understood. In this work, to fill this gap, we adapt and refine a nearly two-hundred-year-old chemical technique for the detection of bile salts in urine, referred to as Pettenkofer's test and monitor the partitioning of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by ATPE. This approach enabled us to tint the otherwise transparent bile salt surfactants to precisely track their distribution and concentration in the biphasic system, thereby unravelling the modus operandi of this popular purification technique.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared LEDs based on lattice-mismatched hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can bridge the gap between narrow linewidth, expensive lasers and broadband, inefficient thermal globars for low-cost chemical sensing in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). However, the efficiency of III-V based mid-IR LEDs at room temperature is low, primarily limited by strong nonradiative Auger-Meitner recombination that is only partially overcome with complex quantum-engineered active regions. Here, we exploit the intrinsically low Auger Meitner recombination rates of the IV-VI semiconductors PbSe and PbSnSe, while leveraging the mature III-V platform through the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions that mediate the ~8% lattice mismatch to GaAs. Electrically injected n-PbSe/p-GaAs LEDs emit at 3.8 um with output powers up to 400 uW under pulsed operation and a peak wall plug efficiency of 0.08% at room temperature, approaching the performance of commercial III-V LEDs at similar wavelengths. Incorporating 7% Sn extends the emission to 5 um in GeSe/PbSnSe/GaAs LEDs with output powers up to 45 uW. Notably, both devices operate despite threading dislocation densities on the order of 1e9/cm^2, underscoring the potential of hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunction architectures. We show that combining the complementary advantages of IV-VI and III-V semiconductors offers a simple and efficient mid IR optoelectronic platform for a rapidly expanding set of applications.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research landscape of magnetism has been recently enriched by the discovery of altermagnetism. It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity. We conclude with an outlook on the nascent experimental research of altermagnetic spintronics, and on the role of relativistic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a low-density filled-ice phase in nitrogen hydrate at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the high-pressure phase diagram of nitrogen hydrate up to 16 GPa at room temperature by combining neutron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and crystal structure prediction. We reveal a rich sequence of structural transformations, from sI/sII clathrates to hexagonal (sH) and tetragonal (sT) phases, culminating in a previously unknown orthorhombic filled-ice structure above 1.8 GPa in the Pnma space group, which we designate as NH-V. This new phase cannot be indexed to any known ice frameworks - such as the high-pressure methane hydrates MH-III (Imma) or MH-IV (Pmcn) - and exhibits a density approximately 30% lower than that of stable ice VII, pointing to distinctive water-nitrogen interactions. Our results refine the understanding of nitrogen hydrate behavior under extreme conditions and demonstrate the propensity of nitrogen and water to form stable filled-ice structures up to 16 GPa, with important implications for planetary science.</description>

      <title>Optical phonons as a testing ground for spin group symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations are highly sensitive to crystal symmetries and their changes across phase transitions. The latter can modify irreducible (co)representations and corresponding infrared and Raman selection rules of phonons. This concept is established for relativistic magnetic point groups, simultaneously transforming spatial and spin coordinates. However, in altermagnets described by non-relativistic spin groups with disjunct symmetry operations for both vector spaces, the phonon selection rules have remained unexplored. Here, we present a detailed study of the infrared- and Raman-active modes in the collinear antiferromagnet and altermagnet candidate Co$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Comparing to ab initio calculations accurately capturing the eigenfrequencies, we identify all expected phonon modes at room temperature and deduce their selection rules using both symmetry approaches. Importantly, we observe the change of selection rules upon antiferromagnetic ordering, agreeing with the relativistic symmetry approach, while the spin group formalism predicts no changes. Therefore, optical phonons can reveal the appropriate symmetry treatment.</description>

      <title>Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer Kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. In the breathing Kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted, and increasing the polar angle induces successive closing and reopening of the valleys. For chiral spin textures, increasing polar angle enlarges the bandgap when chirality \k{appa} = 1, while reducing it when \k{appa} = -1. Moreover, spin chirality enables the quantum anomalous Hall state without spin-orbit coupling. Structural asymmetry and spin chirality effectively modulate the bandgap, Chern number, and valley polarization. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effects in metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel technologies mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as they can involve timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds. In this study, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the necessary high dynamic range of timescales to fully trace the pathways of far-from-equilibrium photoexcited transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a technologically promising prototypical Mott insulator. We find a 105 times adjustment in relaxation time: the memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity during transition causes a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts shaped relaxation lingering over a hundred microseconds versus nanoseconds. The dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system accompanies heterogeneous excitation barriers, as in neural systems.</description>

      <title>Edge states in square lattice media and their deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge states are time-harmonic solutions of conservative wave systems which are plane wave-like parallel to and localized transverse to an interface between two bulk media. We study a class of 2D edge Hamiltonians modeling a medium which slowly interpolates between periodic bulk media via a domain wall across a "rational" line defect. We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk media having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of such media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to perturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band structure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these are quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical degeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct edge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of topological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies are described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via multiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case (1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schr\"{o}dinger operator; in case (2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators. We present analytical results and numerical simulations for both the full 2D edge Hamiltonian spectral problem and the spectra of effective edge Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic dissolution of silicon electrodes.
  In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode.
  Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled:
  1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer
  2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at the Si-oxide interface.
  3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of the oxide.
  Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results, we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Doping Evolution of Nodal Electron Dynamics in Trilayer Cuprate Superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The doping evolution of the nodal electron dynamics in the trilayer cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) is investigated using high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bi2223 single crystals with different doping levels are prepared by controlled annealing which cover the underdoped, optimally-doped and overdoped regions. The electronic phase diagram of Bi2223 is established which describes the T$_\mathrm{c}$ dependence on the sample doping level. The doping dependence of the nodal Fermi momentum for the outer (OP) and inner (IP) CuO$_2$ planes is determined. Charge distribution imbalance between the OP and IP CuO$_2$ planes is quantified, showing enhanced disparity with increasing doping. Nodal band dispersions demonstrate a prominent kink at $\sim$94$\,$meV in the IP band, attributed to the unique Cu coordination in the IP plane, while a weaker $\sim$60$\,$meV kink is observed in the OP band. The nodal Fermi velocity of both OP and IP bands is nearly constant at $\sim$1.62$\,$eV\r{A} independent of doping. These results provide important information to understand the origin of high T$_\mathrm{c}$ and superconductivity mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements (TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter. Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.</description>

      <title>Towards chemical accuracy for chemi- and physisorption with an efficient density functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations, and their modes (linear, circular, or stationary) are symmetry-determined. Circularly polarized phonons, possessing nonzero angular momentum (AM), have drawn widespread attention recently. Despite widespread use of pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) and circularly polarized light polarization flips to identify chiral phonons in Raman scattering, their reliability is debated due to symmetry dependence, and experimental verification standards remain lacking. Here, we systematically study phonon chirality and associated phenomena across magnetic point groups. We establish that the AM-PAM correlation is governed by both crystalline symmetry and Wyckoff positions, dictating conditions where nonzero AM manifests in PAM signatures. Crucially, phonons belonging to distinct irreducible representations exhibit distinct experimental benchmarks, enabling direct determination of crystalline chirality and symmetry classification. Furthermore, we report the discovery of a signature for symmetry-induced phenomena, notably a half-wave plate-analogous effect induced by mirror-odd phonons. Meanwhile, we conducted five experiments to validate our theory.</description>

Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors offer a promising platform for advancing quantum technologies due to their localized energy states and controllable spin properties. Prior research has focused on a limited set of defects within materials such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride. We present a high-throughput study to systematically identify and evaluate point defects across a diverse range of host materials, aiming to uncover previously unexplored defects in novel host materials suitable for use in quantum applications. A range of host materials are selected for their desirable properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d- or f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software framework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements, and interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to calculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements, Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is given to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We uncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum applications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials show properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Beryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particularly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the materials available for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</description>

      <title>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.046802}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moir\'e" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Irradiation Damage in Fe3Cr and Fe5Cr: A Study on the Effects of Chromium Content and Temperature</title>

Abstract: Fe-Cr binary alloys serve as simplified model systems to study irradiation damage relevant to fusion structural materials. Here, Fe-3%Cr and Fe-5%Cr samples were irradiated with 4 MeV Fe ions under a dose rate of 4x10^5 dpa/s across a linear thermal gradient (120C to 480C) in a single experiment, enabling direct comparison of temperature and Cr content effects under identical conditions. Depth-resolved Laue micro-diffraction (~10^4 strain sensitivity), nanoindentation, and AFM reveal non-monotonic evolution of lattice strain and hardness: both decrease with temperature up to ~300C, then increase beyond. This turning point reflects a shift from enhanced defect mobility and partial recovery to solute-defect clustering and cavity formation, which stabilize damage. Fe-3%Cr shows consistently higher strain and hardening than Fe-5%Cr, especially at lower temperatures. Minimal change in post-indentation pile-up indicates limited softening or localization. These results highlight how Cr content and temperature jointly affect irradiation response, offering new insights into defect evolution in fusion-relevant alloys.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineered Layer Dependent Nonlinear Optical Response in Two Dimensional Muscovite for Efficient Optical Limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14786</link>

Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>

Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>
