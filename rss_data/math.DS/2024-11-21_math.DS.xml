      <title>Independence of multipliers in several variables complex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the independence of multipliers for polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb C^n$ and endomorphisms of $\mathbb P^n.$ This allows us to extend results about the bifurcation measure and the critical height obtained in \cite{arXiv:2305.02246} to the case of polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb C^n$ for $n\geq 3$. An important step in the proof is the irreducibility of the spaces of endomorphisms with $N$ marked periodic points, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Existence and Nonexistence of Invariant Curves of Coin Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the coin billiards introduced by M. Bialy. It is a family of maps of the annulus $\mathbb A = \mathbb T \times (0,\pi)$ given by the composition of the classical billiard map on a convex planar table $\Gamma$ with the geodesic flow on the lateral surface of a cylinder (coin) of given height having as bases two copies of $\Gamma$. We prove the following three main theorems: in two different scenarios (when the height of the coin is small, or when the coin is near-circular) there is a family of KAM curves close to, but not accumulating on, the boundary $\partial \mathbb A$; for any non-circular coin, if the height of the coin is sufficiently large, there is a neighbourhood of $\partial \mathbb A$ through which there passes no invariant essential curve; for many noncircular coins, there are Birkhoff zones of instability. These results provide partial answers to questions of Bialy. Finally, we describe the results of some numerical experiments on the elliptical coin billiard.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Estimates on Invariant Manifolds for Surface Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed quantitative analysis on the geometry of invariant manifolds for smooth dissipative systems in dimension two. We begin by quantifying the regularity of any orbit (finite or infinite) in the phase space with a set of explicit inequalities. Then we relate this directly to the quasi-linearization of the local dynamics on regular neighborhoods of this orbit. The parameters of regularity explicitly determine the sizes of the regular neighborhoods and the smooth norms of the corresponding regular charts. As a corollary, we establish the existence of smooth stable and center manifolds with uniformly bounded geometries for regular orbits independently of any pre-existing invariant measure. This provides us with the technical background for the renormalization theory of H\'enon-like maps developed in the sequel papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present note we focus on dynamics on the Gehman dendrite $\mathcal{G}$. It is well-known that the set of its endpoints is homeomorphic to a standard Cantor ternary set. For any given surjective Cantor system $\mathcal{C}$ we provide constructions of (i) a mixing but not exact and (ii) an exact map on $\mathcal{G}$, such that in both cases the subsystem formed by $\text{End}(\mathcal{G})$ is conjugate to the initially chosen system on $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Circular Economy Design through System Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, there is an increasing concern about the unsustainability of the take-make-dispose paradigm upon which traditional production and consumption systems are built. The concept of circular economy is gaining attention as a potential solution, but it is an emerging field still lacking analytical and methodological dynamics approaches. Hence, in this paper, firstly we propose a quantitative definition of circularity, namely, $\lambda$, predicated on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, and then, we use it to state the optimization of the circularity $\lambda$ as an arg-max problem. By leveraging the derivation of Lagrange's equations of motion from the first law of thermodynamics, we apply the analytical mechanics approaches to circularity. Three examples illustrate the calculation of $\lambda$ for different settings of two compartmental networks. In particular, hypothesizing a repair stage followed by product reuse we highlight the memory property of $\lambda$. Finally, robotic repair is proposed within this framework to pave the way for circular robotics as a new area of research in which the performance of a robotic system is measured against $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>The impact of recovery rate heterogeneity in achieving herd immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herd immunity is a critical concept in epidemiology, describing a threshold at which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune, either through infection or vaccination, thereby preventing sustained transmission of a pathogen. In the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics, the achievement of herd immunity depends on key parameters, including the transmission rate ($\beta$) and the recovery rate ($\gamma$), where $\gamma$ represents the inverse of the mean infectious period. While the transmission rate has received substantial attention, recent studies have underscored the significant role of $\gamma$ in determining the timing and sustainability of herd immunity. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evident that assuming $\gamma$ as a constant parameter might oversimplify the dynamics, as variations in recovery times can reflect diverse biological, social, and healthcare-related factors.
  In this paper, we investigate how heterogeneity in the recovery rate affects herd immunity. We show empirically that the mean of the recovery rate is not a reliable metric for determining the achievement of herd immunity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result demonstrating that it is instead the mean recovery time, which is the mean of the inverse $1/\gamma$ of the recovery rate that is critical in deciding whether herd immunity is achievable within the SIR framework. A similar result is proved for the SEIR model. These insights have significant implications for public health interventions and theoretical modeling of epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex) and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we say that the pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex). We prove that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This generalizes our previous result obtained in the case where the associated curve consists only of invariant lines.</description>

      <title>Extreme firebrand transport by atmospheric waves in wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wildfires, burning pieces of ember-firebrands-are carried downstream by wind. At the time of landing, these firebrands can start secondary fires far away from the main burning unit. This phenomenon is called spotting and the secondary fires are referred to as spot fires. Here, we first present numerical evidence that atmospheric traveling waves can increase the spotting distance by at least an order of magnitude compared to unidirectional wind conditions. We then present theoretical results explaining this numerical observation. In particular, we show that the firebrand's motion can synchronize with the traveling wave, leading to a surf-like motion for some firebrand particles. This delays the firebrand's landing, making extreme spotting distances possible. This physical phenomena helps explain the discrepancy between previous theoretical estimates of maximum spotting distance and much larger spotting distances observed empirically. We derive new analytical expressions for the landing time and landing distance of the firebrands.</description>

      <title>A Birkhoff Normal Form Theorem for Partial Differential Equations on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an abstract Birkhoff normal form theorem for Hamiltonian partial differential equations on torus. The normal form is complete up to arbitrary finite order. The proof is based on a valid non-resonant condition and a suitable norm of Hamiltonian function. Then as two examples, we apply this theorem to nonlinear wave equation in one dimension and nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in high dimension. Consequently, the polynomially long time stability is proved in Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with the index $s$ being much smaller than before. Further, by taking the iterative steps depending on the size of initial datum, we prove sub-exponentially long time stability for these two equations.</description>

      <title>Existence of All Wilton Ripples of the Kawahara Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of all small-amplitude Wilton ripple solutions of the Kawahara equation is proven. These are periodic, traveling-wave solutions that bifurcate from a two-dimensional nullspace spanned by two distinct, co-propagating cosine waves. In contrast with previous results, the proof, which relies on a carefully constructed Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, implies the existence of all small-amplitude Wilton ripples of the Kawahara equation, of which there are countably infinite. Though this result pertains only to the Kawahara equation, the method of proof likely extends to most nonlinear dispersive equations admitting Wilton ripple solutions.</description>

Abstract: We give a formula with explicit error term for the number of $K$-rational points $P$ satisfying $H(f(P)) \le X$ as $X \to \infty$, where $f$ is a nonconstant morphism between projective spaces defined over a number field $K$ and $H$ is the absolute multiplicative Weil height. This yields formulae for the counting functions of $f(\mathbb{P}^m(K))$ with respect to the Weil height as well as of $\mathbb{P}^m(K)$ with respect to the Call-Silverman canonical height.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an analogue of W. Thurston's "Master teapot" for each principal vein in the Mandelbrot set, and generalize geometric properties known for the corresponding object for real maps. In particular, we show that eigenvalues outside the unit circle move continuously, while we show "persistence" for roots inside the unit circle. As an application, this shows that the outside part of the corresponding "Thurston set" is path connected. In order to do this, we define a version of kneading theory for principal veins, and we prove the equivalence of several algorithms that compute the core entropy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion on Networks: Perturbations and Consensus Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of equations representing nonlinear diffusion on networks. A particular instance of our model can be seen as a network equivalent of the porous-medium equation. We are interested in studying perturbations of such a system and describing the consensus dynamics. The nonlinearity of the equations gives rise to potentially intricate structures of equilibria that can intersect the consensus space, creating singularities. For the unperturbed case, we characterise the sets of equilibria by exploiting the symmetries under group transformations of the nonlinear vector field. Under small perturbations, we obtain a slow-fast system. Thus, we analyse the slow-fast dynamics near the singularities on the consensus space. The analysis at this stage is carried out for complete networks, allowing a detailed characterisation of the system. We provide a linear approximation of the intersecting branches of equilibria at the singular points; as a consequence, we show that, generically, the singularities on the consensus space turn out to be transcritical. We prove under local assumptions the existence of canard solutions. For generic graph structures, assuming more strict conditions on the perturbation, we prove the existence of a maximal canard, which coincides with the consensus subspace. In addition, we validate by numerical simulations the principal findings of our main theory, extending the study to non-complete graphs. Moreover, we show how the delayed loss of stability associated to the canards induces transient spatio-temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Chemical mass-action systems as analog computers: implementing arithmetic computations at specified speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent technological advances allow us to view chemical mass-action systems as analog computers. In this context, the inputs to a computation are encoded as initial values of certain chemical species while the outputs are the limiting values of other chemical species. In this paper, we design chemical systems that carry out the elementary arithmetic computations of: identification, inversion, $m$th roots (for $m \ge 2$), addition, multiplication, absolute difference, rectified subtraction over non-negative real numbers, and partial real inversion over real numbers. We prove that these ``elementary modules'' have a speed of computation that is independent of the inputs to the computation. Moreover, we prove that finite sequences of such elementary modules, running in parallel, can carry out composite arithmetic over real numbers, also at a rate that is independent of inputs. Furthermore, we show that the speed of a composite computation is precisely the speed of the slowest elementary step. Specifically, the scale of the composite computation, i.e. the number of elementary steps involved in the composite, does not affect the overall asymptotic speed -- a feature of the parallel computing nature of our algorithm. Our proofs require the careful mathematical analysis of certain non-autonomous systems, and we believe this analysis will be useful in different areas of applied mathematics, dynamical systems, and the theory of computation. We close with a discussion on future research directions, including numerous important open theoretical questions pertaining to the field of computation with reaction networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a family of travelling wave solutions in a variant of the $\textit{Zeldovich-Frank-Kamenetskii (ZFK) equation}$, a reaction-diffusion equation which models the propagation of planar laminar premixed flames in combustion theory. Our results are valid in an asymptotic regime which corresponds to a reaction with high activation energy, and provide a rigorous and geometrically informative counterpart to formal asymptotic results that have been obtained for similar problems using $\textit{high activation energy asymptotics}$. We also go beyond the existing results by (i) proving smoothness of the minimum wave speed function $\overline c(\epsilon)$, where $0&lt; \epsilon \ll 1$ is the small parameter, and (ii) providing an asymptotic series for a flat slow manifold which plays a role in the construction of travelling wave solutions for non-minimal wave speeds $c &gt; \overline c(\epsilon)$. The analysis is complicated by the presence of an exponential nonlinearity which leads to two different scaling regimes as $\epsilon \to 0$, which we refer to herein as the $\textit{convective-diffusive}$ and $\textit{diffusive-reactive}$ zones. The main idea of the proof is to use the geometric blow-up method to identify and characterise a $(c,\epsilon)$-family of heteroclinic orbits which traverse both of these regimes, and correspond to travelling waves in the original ZFK equation. More generally, our analysis contributes to a growing number of studies which demonstrate the utility of geometric blow-up approaches to the study dynamical systems with singular exponential nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Determining the Possibility of Multistationarity in a Model of the Earth Carbon Cycle with Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multistationarity or the existence of steady-state multiplicity in the Earth System raises the possibility that the Earth may reach a "tipping point" and rapidly transition to a warmer steady-state from which recovery may be practically impossible. In detailed Earth models that require extensive computation time, it is difficult to make an a priori prediction of the possibility of multistationarity. In this study, we demonstrate Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) analysis of a simple heuristic box model of the Earth System carbon cycle with the human intervention of Direct Air Capture. The analysis reveals necessary conditions for the combination of system parameters where steady-state multiplicity may exist. With this method, other negative emissions technologies (NET) may be screened in a relatively simple manner to aid in the priority setting by policymakers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics for individual payoff game-theoretic models of vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vaccination is widely recognised as one of the most effective forms of public health interventions. Individuals decisions regarding vaccination creates a complex social dilemma between individual and collective interests, where each person's decision affects the overall public health outcome. In this paper, we study the adaptive dynamics for the evolutionary dynamics of strategies in a fundamental game-theoretic model of vaticination. We show the existence of an (Nash) equilibrium and analyse the stability and bifurcations when varying the relevant parameters. We also demonstrate our analytical results by several concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of direct reciprocity with N rounds of memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of direct reciprocity explores how individuals cooperate when they interact repeatedly. In repeated interactions, individuals can condition their behaviour on what happened earlier. One prominent example of a conditional strategy is Tit-for-Tat, which prescribes to cooperate if and only if the co-player did so in the previous round. The evolutionary dynamics among such memory-1 strategies have been explored in quite some detail. However, obtaining analytical results on the dynamics of higher memory strategies becomes increasingly difficult, due to the rapidly growing size of the strategy space. Here, we derive such results for the adaptive dynamics in the donation game. In particular, we prove that for every orbit forward in time, there is an associated orbit backward in time that also solves the differential equation. Moreover, we analyse the dynamics by separating payoffs into a symmetric and an anti-symmetric part and demonstrate some properties of the anti-symmetric part. These results highlight some interesting symmetries that arise when interchanging player one with player two, and cooperation with defection.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between dynamical symmetries, Cartan symmetries, and dynamical similarities in contact mechanics. Using an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we provide a characterization of those symmetries and a new description in terms of tensor densities. Additionally, we show that, in certain cases, this construction enables the recovery of integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for durable tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>
