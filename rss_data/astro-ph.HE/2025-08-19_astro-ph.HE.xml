      <title>Tera-Hertz Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts from Coherent Cherenkov Radiation by Tilted Bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients characterized by ultrahigh brightness temperatures, suggesting coherent emission mechanisms in extreme astrophysical processes. In this paper, we extend the bunched coherent Cherenkov radiation (CChR) framework by incorporating bunch inclination and geometric configuration parameters, enabling it to more rigorously model FRB emission and tera-Hertz (THz) emission from magnetars. When relativistic bunches are injected into the magnetized plasma of a magnetar's magnetosphere at the Cherenkov angle, their emitted waves achieve phase coherence through constructive interference. Furthermore, the three-dimensional geometry of the bunches plays a crucial role in influencing the coherence of the radiation. Within the framework of CChR, we predict the existence of THz emission counterparts associated with FRBs and explain the observed characteristics of the THz-emitting magnetar SGR J1745-2900. Detections of such counterparts by upgraded millimeter telescopes (e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, IRAM) would be expected to provide new insights into the potential physical connection between FRBs and magnetars.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.</description>

      <title>Late-time Hubble Space Telescope Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi Show Ongoing Interaction with Circumstellar Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present far- and near-ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the Type II supernovae (SNe) SN~2023ixf from days 199 to 722 and SN~2024ggi at days 41 and 232. Both supernovae show broad, blueshifted, and asymmetric UV emission lines with an initial maximum velocity of $\sim9000\,km\,s^{-1}$ and narrow unresolved emission in CIV. We compare the optical and UV emission-line profiles, showing that they evolve from two distinct velocity profiles to a single profile tracing the UV emission. We interpret this as shock power from interaction with circumstellar material coming to dominate over the radioactive-decay power from the inner ejecta. Comparing our observations to radiative transfer models with injected shock power, we find SN~2024ggi is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock, abs}}=1\times10^{41}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at day 40, SN~2023ixf at day 300 and SN~2024ggi at day 200 are best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=1\times10^{40}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and SN~2023ixf at day 600 is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=5\times10^{39}\,erg\,s^{-1}$. From these models, we find the mass-loss rate of both supernovae increased just before explosion. For SN~2023ixf our mass-loss rates go from $4\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 600 yr before explosion to $2\times10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 15 yr prior to explosion. For SN~2024ggi, we find a mass-loss rate of $9\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 150 yr before explosion and $1\times10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 30 yr before explosion.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous discovery of a young cluster of galaxies at $z \sim 0.5$ projected next to the nearby tadpole galaxy KUG 1138 + 327</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\sim 9 \times 10^{56}~\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and the Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $&gt; 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^&gt;_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.</description>

      <title>Limitations in constraining neutron star radii and nuclear properties from inspiral gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Long term variability of Cygnus X-1. IX. A spectral-timing comparison of Cygnus X-1 and MAXI J1820+070 in the hard state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which in the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with intriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here, we compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg X-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and NICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms spectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard state MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1 data, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of spectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1 shows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are clearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags and rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than for MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the different black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their different accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity diagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of coronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic difference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been suggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard intermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Magnetar Crust Quakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfv\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.</description>

These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.</description>

      <title>Runaway stars and the Galactic supernova remnant landscape: non-thermal emission and observational evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum.
  Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population.
  Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey.
  Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data.
  Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.</description>

      <title>Photospheric radius expansion thermonuclear burst and X-ray reflection from the neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1702-429</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of thermonuclear bursts from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429 detected with NICER and XMM-Newton. The thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star photosphere expanded to a maximum of $23.1_{-3.2}^{+3.8}$ km while its temperature reached a minimum of 1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star, potentially due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of 4U 1702-429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around 20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill provides an inner disk radius of 12 $R_g$ and an inclination angle of $\sim39^{\circ}$. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star is estimated to be 5.1 $\times10^8$ G, assuming that the accretion disk is truncated at magnetosphere boundary.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae in the eROSITA eRASS1 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>

      <title>EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Double-Peaked Optical Afterglows with X-ray Shallow Decay Inferring a Magnetized Thick Shell Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts early afterglows are important tracers for determining the radial structure and magnetization of the ejecta. In this paper, we focus on GRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB 110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A multi-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model is publicly available as the open source Julia package "Magglow".</description>

      <title>The Design and Performance Characteristics of the NRL4 ASIC Developed for the COSI Small Explorer Gamma-ray Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gamma-ray observatories aim to enable precision measurements in high-energy astrophysics using advanced semiconductor detector technologies. Meeting the scientific requirements of modern instruments demands detector systems that provide high spatial and spectral resolution across large detection areas, with strict limits on power consumption and mass. These needs drive innovation in front-end electronics and mixed-signal processing to support compact detector electrode geometries. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are essential in front-end readout electronics, enabling high-channel-density and low-power systems, while maintaining low-noise performance suitable for space-based instruments and balloon-borne payloads. The NRL4 (Naval Research Laboratory 4) is a recently developed 32-channel front-end ASIC featuring low-power, low-noise channels consisting of charge-sensitive preamplifiers, 4 configurable gain settings, dual configurable shapers for optimized timing and energy resolution, trimmable per-channel discrimination, time-to-analog conversion, and peak-detect output. The NRL4 has been integrated with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) dual-sided strip detector with a 1.16 mm strip pitch. Energy resolution of 3 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 59.54 keV was achieved with a gain of 18.4 mV/fC and a slow shaper peaking time of 2 {\mu}s. Preliminary results from ongoing research demonstrate the suitability of the NRL4 for high-resolution, low-power gamma-ray spectroscopy for ground and space-based missions.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings with Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays scattering with neutrinos produced in supernovae induce a flux of supernova neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate the neutrino flux arising from this new mechanism in environments with large cosmic-ray and supernova densities, such as some Active Galactic Nuclei. Under plausible astrophysical conditions, this flux may be detectable with high-energy neutrino telescopes, just considering the proton-neutrino scattering cross section expected in the Standard Model. Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such scatterings can reach $ \sqrt{s} \sim 10-100$ TeV, where the proton-neutrino cross section may be enhanced by new physics such as extra-dimensional theories. The boosted neutrino signal benefits from such an enhancement in the cross section not only at the detection point on Earth, but also at production in astrophysical sources, which allows us to set novel constraints on the ultra-high energy proton-neutrino cross section with neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.</description>

      <title>GW200105: A detailed study of eccentricity in the neutron star-black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW200105_162426 is the first neutron star-black hole merger to be confidently confirmed through either gravitational-wave or electromagnetic observations. Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study, Morras et al. (2025), that employed a post-Newtonian inspiral-only waveform model and reported strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from $99\%$ credible interval, but yield a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of Morras et al. (2025). Additionally, similar to previous eccentric-only analysis Planas et al. (2025), we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.</description>

      <title>Type IIb Supernova Progenitors in 3D: Variability and Episodic Mass Loss revealed by Radiation-Hydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first 3D Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulations of partially-stripped ($M_\mathrm{core}\sim10M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{env}\sim0.1-1M_\odot$) Yellow Supergiant ($L\sim10^5$, $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5000-8000$K) envelopes, constructed with Athena++. These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models. However, it does provide a natural, self-consistent explanation for the presence and diversity of dense circumstellar material observed or inferred around pulsating evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Mass Loss and Subsequent Thermal Evolution of Surviving Helium White Dwarfs Shocked by Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a double white dwarf (WD) binary, a surviving WD companion leaves at its orbital velocity $\approx 1$,000 - 3,000 km/s. The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ helium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated $\approx0.02\,M_{\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\approx 0.005 - 0.06\,M_{\odot}$ with velocities $\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick velocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital velocity $\lesssim$ 1,600 km/s. We model the post-explosion evolution of the shock-heated companions using MESA, and find reasonable agreement with the hypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332-3541 &amp; SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving $\gtrsim 0.3\,M_{\odot}$ helium WD can be ruled out in SN1972E &amp; SN2011fe, and any surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 &amp; SN1006.</description>

      <title>Scalarized neutron stars with a highly relativistic core in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

Abstract: Compact stars in scalar-tensor gravity have been extensively investigated, but relatively few studies have focused on highly relativistic neutron stars (NSs) with an extremely dense core region where the trace of the energy-momentum tensor reverses its sign. In this regime, we identify the origin of the phenomenon where {\it multiple} scalarized solutions exist for a {\it fixed} central density, arising from the oscillatory profile of the scalar field inside the star. This origin further indicates that the multi-branch structure emerges for both negative and positive $\beta$, the quadratic-term coefficient in the effective coupling function between the scalar field and conventional matter in the Einstein frame. By comparing the Damour--Esposito-Far\`ese and Mendes-Ortiz models of the scalar-tensor gravity, we demonstrate that their distinct scalarization behaviors stem from whether the effective coupling function is bounded. We also compute for scalarized NSs with a highly relativistic dense core in scalar-tensor theories the moment of inertia and tidal deformability that are relevant to pulsar-timing and gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>The Demographics of Binary Companions to Stripped-Envelope Supernovae: Confronting Observations with Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) mark the deaths of massive stars without hydrogen-rich envelopes. Most SESNe likely originate from binary systems where a companion stripped the progenitor of its envelope. Years of HST imaging of nearby SESNe sites have produced a statistically meaningful sample of constraints on surviving binary companions. We assemble the current sample of six companion detections and six non-detections from the literature, re-analyzing whenever needed. We then conduct the first statistical comparison with binary population-synthesis predictions, primarily based on new calculations performed with the POSYDON framework. Across a metallicity range, our models predict that 80-90% of Type Ib/c and 60-85% of IIb SNe explode with a rapidly rotating, main-sequence companion. The observed luminosity distribution favors fairly inefficient mass accretion and failed explosions of the most massive stripped stars. The companion detection fraction broadly matches predictions, given the imaging depth, but appears elevated for Type IIb SNe. In all but one non-detection, a faint, undetected companion is the most likely scenario. The red, apparently evolved companions in a few Type Ib/c SNe may result from strong interaction with the ejecta, expected in $\sim$12% of them. Companion demographics offer a powerful, independent probe of SESN progenitor systems, with the current sample disfavoring efficient accretion and supporting Wolf-Rayet non-explodability. Larger companion samples and follow-up studies will further clarify binary pathways to SESNe, serving as benchmarks for transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Current sheet formation under radiative cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, analytically solvable MHD model of current sheet formation through X-point collapse under optically thin radiative cooling. Our results show that cooling accelerates the collapse of the X-point along the inflows, but strong cooling can arrest or even reverse the current sheet elongation in the outflow direction. Hence, we detail a modification to the radiatively-cooled Sweet-Parker model developed by Uzdensky &amp; McKinney (2011) to allow for varying current sheet length. The steady-state solution shows that when radiative cooling dominates compressional heating, the current sheet length is shorter than the system size, with an increased reconnection rate compared to the classical Sweet-Parker rate. The model and subsequent results lay out the groundwork for a more complete theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in regimes dominated by optically thin radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning intermediate mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) BHs. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruptions of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive BHs. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between BH and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. The coupling of BH and stellar spin results in distinctive behaviour of mass distribution of debris, compared to non-rotating cases. Further, while late time fallback rates of debris into the BH is unaffected by only BH spin, these have noticeable deviations in the presence of stellar spin, in particular, this causes a broadening of the fallback curves at late times. On the other hand, gravitational wave signatures are unaffected by stellar spin in the parameter regime that we consider.</description>

      <title>Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Massive Double White Dwarf Binary Mergers from the Moon: Extending the Reach of Multi-messenger Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of lunar-based gravitational-wave detectors to broaden the multi-messenger astrophysics landscape by detecting mergers of massive ($M_1,M_2 &gt;1 M_\odot$) double white dwarf (WD) binaries. These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). We estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to $\sim$1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before merger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.</description>

      <title>XL-Calibur measurements of polarised hard X-ray emission from the Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the linear polarisation degree (PD) and angle (PA) for hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar and wind nebula. Measurements were made with the XL-Calibur ($\sim$15-80 keV) balloon-borne Compton-scattering polarimeter in July 2024. The polarisation parameters are determined using a Bayesian analysis of Stokes parameters obtained from X-ray scattering angles. Well-constrained ($\sim$8.5$\sigma$) results are obtained for the polarisation of the $\sim$19-64 keV signal integrated over all pulsar phases: PD=(25.1$\pm$2.9)% and PA=(129.8$\pm$3.2)$^\circ$. In the off-pulse (nebula-dominated) phase range, the PD is constrained at $\sim$4.5$\sigma$ and is compatible with the phase-integrated result. The PA of the nebular hard X-ray emission aligns with that measured by IXPE in the 2-8 keV band for the toroidal inner region of the pulsar wind nebula, where the hard X-rays predominantly originate. For the main pulsar peak, PD=(32.8$^{+18.2}_{-28.5}$)% and PA=(156.0 $\pm$ 21.7)$^\circ$, while for the second peak (inter-pulse), PD=(0.0$^{+33.6}_{-0.0}$)% and PA=(154.5 $\pm$ 34.5)$^\circ$. A low level of polarisation in the pulsar peaks likely does not favour emission originating from the inner regions of the pulsar magnetosphere. Discriminating between Crab pulsar emission models will require deeper observations, e.g. with a satellite-borne hard X-ray polarimeter.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Shock Structures and QPOs After Halting BHL Accretion onto Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate for the first time the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) that arise as a result of halting the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism around a Kerr black hole. Unlike previous studies, which focused on shock cones or perturbed tori, we show that stopping BHL accretion leads to the formation of a new plasma structure. On this plasma structure, spiral shock waves are observed to develop. These shock waves are found to excite both low-frequency (LFQPOs) and high-frequency QPOs (HFQPOs). Two key results emerge from our numerical simulations. First, LFQPOs arise only when the halted flow is supersonic, identifying for the first time the velocity dependence of their formation. Second, nonlinear couplings that produce $3:2$, $2:1$, and $1:2:3$ resonances appear exclusively for rapidly rotating black holes ($a/M = 0.9$), directly linking spin to resonance states. In addition, it is demonstrated that HFQPOs are strongly influenced by the black hole spin. The generated QPOs are observed to be excited through the modes induced by the black hole spacetime curvature. The frequencies obtained from the numerical simulations align with observations of $GRS1915+105$, $XTEJ1550-564$, and $REJ1034+396$, thereby bridging stellar-mass and supermassive black hole systems within a unified framework. Thus, the newly uncovered physical mechanism associated with halted BHL accretion is capable of explaining both the persistence and the intermittency of QPOs across diverse astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform metal distribution in the ram-pressure stripped circumgalactic medium of M86</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the recent ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.</description>

      <title>The impact of natal kicks on black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic variation during a fast X-ray outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0709-159 / LY CMa observed by NICER</title>

Abstract: We report on a quasi-periodic variation at $\sim1$ Hz during a fast X-ray outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0709$-$159 / LY CMa observed by the Neutron-star interior composition explorer (NICER). The new X-ray transient MAXI J0709$-$159 was discovered on 2022 January 25. Due to the transient X-ray behavior characterized by the short (a few hours) outburst duration, rapid ($\lesssim$ 1 s) variability with spectral change, and large luminosity swing from $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the object was considered likely to be a supergiant X-ray binary with a neutron star (NS) categorized as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT). Follow-up NICER and NuSTAR observations confirmed that the position of the new X-ray object is consistent with a Be star, LY CMa, which has been also identified as a B supergiant. We analyzed the NICER data obtained from 3 hours to 6 days after the discovery. The light curve reveals that the X-ray activity continued for $\sim7$ hours in sparse short flares, each lasting $\lesssim 100$ seconds, and the luminosity instantaneously reached up to $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The light-curve and spectral features reasonably agree with those expected from accretion of a clumpy stellar-wind onto a magnetized NS. The variability power spectrum during the brightest flare shows a broad peak at $1.1$ Hz resembling a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). If the QPO is attributed to the Keplerian orbital frequency at the inner edge of a transient accretion disk truncated by the NS magnetosphere, the NS surface magnetic field is estimated to be $\sim 10^{12}$ G.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $M_\bullet^{\rm thr} \simeq 3\times 10^7 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps (roughly 80%). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups prevail. Most notably, disks without migration traps ($\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups at $R\simeq 10^2 R_{\rm S}$ due to traffic-jam-like accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>

Abstract: Nearly all of the previous gravitational wave (GW) searches in the LIGO-Virgo data included GW waveforms with only the dominant quadrupole harmonic, i.e., omitting higher-order harmonics which are predicted by general relativity. We improved the IAS pipeline by efficiently introducing higher harmonics in the GW templates using the techniques in Wadekar et al. [1, 2]. Using the IAS-HM pipeline on the public LIGO-Virgo data from the O3 run, we find 11 new candidate BBH mergers with $0.52\leq p_\mathrm{astro}\leq 0.88$ (we use the detection threshold as the astrophysical probability, $p_\mathrm{astro}$, being over 0.5, following the approach of other pipelines). We broadly recover the high-significance events from earlier catalogs, except a few which were vetoed. We also find that including higher harmonics in our search raises the significance of a few previously reported marginal events (e.g., GW190711_030756).
  A few notable properties of our new candidate events are as follows. At $&gt;95$% credibility, 4 candidates have primary masses in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) range (i.e., above $\sim$100 $M_\odot$). 5 candidates have median mass ratio $q \leq 0.5$. 5 candidates have median redshift $z \geq 0.8$. 3 candidates have non-zero $\chi_{\rm eff}$ at $&gt;95\%$ credibility. While our new candidate events have modest false alarm rates ($\gtrsim 1.5 $/yr), a population inference study including these can better inform the parameter space of BHs corresponding to the pair instability mass gap, high redshifts and asymmetric mass ratios.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (everywhere vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00650</link>

Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>High-cadence observations of galactic nuclei by the future two-band UV-photometry mission QUVIK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quick Ultra-VIolet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krti\v{c}ka et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim 0.1$-$1$ day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z&lt;1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($&lt;20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening) in the era of intensive wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in rotating dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are a key observational target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The waveforms may be affected by the astrophysical environment surrounding the central black hole (BH), and in particular by the surrounding dark matter (DM) distribution. In this work, we consider the effect of a rotating DM "spike" around a central Kerr BH, and assess its detectability with LISA. Using a fully relativistic model for the rotating spike, we investigate its effect on the inspiral and hence on the emitted GW signals. We compute dephasings and mismatches to quantify how the spin of the primary BH affects the binary dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We show that the modifications due to the spin of the primary BH improve the detection prospects of DM spikes with LISA, and must be taken into account for future parameter estimation studies. We also estimate within post-Newtonian theory how the environment affects the background metric, and show that this effect is mostly negligible for the systems we consider.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: the wideband paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vela is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>Mass-feeding of jet-launching white dwarfs in grazing and common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose a scenario that allows white dwarfs (WDs) to launch relatively powerful jets when they enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) or experience a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) with a red giant branch star (RGB) or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this, still a speculative scenario, the accretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~1Ro that increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite jets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as its mass increases. The jets launched by the disk remove high-entropy gas from its outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates due to nuclear burning on its surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent findings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a major role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous red novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to include jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a phase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a major ingredient in modeling and simulating all energetic luminous red novae.</description>
