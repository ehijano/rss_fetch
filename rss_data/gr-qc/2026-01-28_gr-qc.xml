      <title>The stealth Kerr solution in the bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find Kerr solution accompanied with a nontrivial vector field as a solution to one of the simplest vector-tensor theories of gravity, namely the bumblebee model with an intriguing coupling constant between the Ricci curvature tensor and the vector field. We also demonstrate that the accompanied vector field can be generated via the Newman-Janis algorithm from a simple spherical vector field, which together with the Schwarzschild metric constitutes a solution to the same bumblebee model. It is probably the simplest example of a theory and its black-hole solutions for the Newman-Janis algorithm to hold except for general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and a new realization of the matter Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new realization of the matter Lagrangian is introduced which models the dark energy component as a non-standard combination of thermodynamics quantities of the baryonic matter. We will prove that the present realization is independent of existing models with matter-geometry couplings and has a property that the energy-momentum tensor of both baryonic matter and dark energy is conserved separately. We further show that two possible choices of the matter Lagrangian in the $\Lambda$CDM model are not totally equivalent and investigate the background and perturbative constraints on the form of matter Lagrangian. We will also investigate cosmological implications of a test model with logarithmic DE and obtain the model parameters by confronting the model with observational data on the cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ and $f\sigma_8$ datasets. We will also explain in details the predictions of the model on the late time behavior of the universe and compare the result with $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the consistent use of precessing, higher order multipole models for gravitational wave analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of gravitational-wave (GW) observations allows for constraints to be placed on the underlying population of black holes; current estimates show that black hole spins are small, with binaries more likely to have comparable component masses. Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated "worst-case" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\sim 20\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power.</description>

      <title>Inertial-to-Rindler Coordinates, with applications to the Twin Paradox, Radar Time and the Unruh Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we formulate a two-parameter family of transformations in flat Minkowksi spacetime that smoothly interpolates between motion with constant initial/final velocity (inertial coordinates), and with constant acceleration (Rindler coordinates \cite{Rindler:1956}), which we term Inertial-to-Rindler (I2R) coordinates. We revisit the Twin ``Paradox" and show how the new I2R coordinates justify the ``immediate-" and ``gradual-turnaround" scenarios discussed in many texbooks and articles. We also examine the radar time formulation of hypersurfaces of simultaneity by Dolby and Gull \cite{Dolby_Gull:2001} for these new coordinates as we transition from zero to uniform acceleration. Finaly we re-examine the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency Minkowski plane wave as observed by the I2R observer, and derive perturbative corrections to the Unruh \cite{Unruh:1976} temperature for the two cases of initial/final velocities slightly greater than zero, and slightly less than the speed of light - the latter of which characterizes constant acceleration motion. We argue for a proposed velocity-dependent generalization of the Unruh temperature that smoothly varies from zero at zero-acceleration, to the standard form at constant acceleration.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the inflationary epoch, we investigate the reconstruction of the background variables within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, considering the scalar spectral index $n_s(N)$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r(N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of $e-$folds. Under a general formalism, we determine the effective potential and the coupling function associated with the Gauss-Bonnet term as functions of the cosmological parameters $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$, respectively. To implement the reconstruction methodology for the background variables, we study an example in which the attractors for the index $n_s$ and the ratio $r$ are in agreement with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. In this context, explicit expressions for the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling parameter $\xi(\phi)$ are reconstructed. Moreover, the reconstruction based on observational parameters shows that $V(\phi)\not\propto 1/\xi(\phi)$, in contrast to the assumption adopted in the literature for the study of the evolution of the universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Classical emergence of the quantum-backreacted BTZ black hole from exponential electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a recently reported generalization of the Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli black hole arising in New Massive Gravity sourced by the quantum fluctuations of scalar matter, now examined through the lens of a purely classical framework. We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer--Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spiral Density Waves and Torque Balance in the Kerr Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs are a key science target for the upcoming LISA mission. Existing models of disc-EMRI interactions typically rely on crude dynamical friction or Newtonian planetary migration prescriptions, which fail to capture the relativistic fluid response induced by the binary potential. In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Black Hole Interiors in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with scale-dependent gravitational couplings within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. In the Hamiltonian formulation based on a renormalization-group improved Einstein-Hilbert action, the consistency of the theory and the Poisson algebra of constraints have been clarified. Within this framework, we show that, despite the explicit scale dependence of Newton's constant, the classical solutions are generically unaffected by the running of the coupling.
  We then derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating the scale dependence of the gravitational couplings and analyze its solutions in the minisuperspace framework. In the classical limit, while the scale dependence of Newton's constant does not affect the classical behavior, the running of the cosmological constant can contribute to the classical solutions. Moreover, we show that the quantum behavior in the ultraviolet regime acts toward suppressing singularity formation in all cases, independently of how the renormalization-group scale is identified with spacetime coordinates and of the relative magnitudes of the ultraviolet fixed points of the running Newton's constant and cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by Frolov black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by Frolov black holes, which is a class of regularization of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om spacetime. By analyzing the null geodesics, we determine the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter, deriving the geometric capture cross section and the classical differential scattering cross section. Utilizing the partial-wave method, we numerically compute the absorption and scattering cross sections across a broad frequency range. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with the low-frequency limit and the high-frequency sinc approximation, as well as with the semiclassical glory approximation. We analyze the dependence of the spectra on the charge and the regularization parameter (Hubble length). Under the horizon-radius normalization, we observe that the total absorption cross section increases with the regularization parameter, a behavior we attribute to the variation of the dimensionless mass. Furthermore, by comparing Frolov, Reissner--Nordstr\"om, and Hayward black holes, we demonstrate that their absorption and scattering patterns are nearly indistinguishable when their critical impact parameters or glory impact parameters are matched. This indicates that the photon sphere geometry predominantly governs scalar field interactions, while the detailed core structure plays a secondary role. Our work underscores the potential of wave-based probes to test regular black hole geometries and their observable imprints.</description>

      <title>Atomic clocks and gravitational waves as probes of non-metricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-metricity provides a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, yet its experimental signatures remain largely unexplored. In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and observational properties of weakly Proca-charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_{\gamma}&lt;10^{-48}\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $\mu \leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 &lt; \mathrm{Q} &lt; 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required.</description>

      <title>The diffusion equation is compatible with special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its parabolic character, the diffusion equation exhibits instantaneous spatial spreading, and becomes unstable when Lorentz-boosted. According to the conventional interpretation, these features reflect a fundamental incompatibility with special relativity. In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the objects of limiting compactness: Black hole and Buchdahl star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity, there exist two objects of limiting compactness, one with a null boundary defining the horizon of a black hole and the other with a timelike boundary defining a Buchdahl star. The two are characterized by gravitational energy equal to or half the mass. Since non-gravitational mass-energy is the source of gravitational energy, both of these objects are manifestly stable. We demonstrate in this letter, in a simple and general way, that the equilibrium state defining the object is indeed stable, independent of the nature of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise characterization on the detection of mHz stochastic gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission. However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Multidimensional arrow of time" (arXiv:2601.14134)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent preprint [arXiv:2601.14134v1], Rubin argues that the arrow of time originates from the monotonic growth of the volume of extra dimensions. While the identification of a geometric origin for time's arrow is compelling in the case of brane-world models, we point out a possible tension between the proposed volume growth and the observational stability of the effective four-dimensional Newton's gravitational constant, G, that may arise in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. In standard KK approaches, such volume growth induces a time-variation of G that exceeds Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) bounds by many orders of magnitude. To resolve this tension while preserving the author's key insight in the Kaluza-Klein case, we propose an extension: the "shape-dynamic arrow of time". By utilizing the scale-invariant monotonicity of Perelman's nu-entropy under normalized Ricci flow, we demonstrate how an arrow of time can emerge from the geometric smoothing of extra dimensions at fixed volume, thereby satisfying observational constraints on fundamental constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel dictionary relating solutions of the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell theory to solutions of gauged Skyrme--Maxwell--Einstein models in $(3+1)$ dimensions has been established. This development provides a clear and systematic route to constructing new configurations with nontrivial Baryonic charge and magnetic field, leveraging the fact that the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell system is considerably more tractable, thanks to powerful solution-generating techniques. In this work, we exploit the framework that allows compact sources dressed by scalar fields to be consistently embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds, and we construct their dual counterparts carrying Baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The resulting Baryonic charge is expressed directly in terms of the parameters characterizing the seed spacetime, and a corresponding quantization condition involving these parameters is explicitly derived. Consequently, the mass and the Baryonic charge are not independent parameters. These results provide a closed analytic formula for the black hole mass parameter in terms of the Baryonic charge and the magnetic field. This relation between the mass parameter and the Baryonic charge is linear for large values of the mass, while significant deviations from linearity arise if the mass takes intermediate values.</description>

      <title>Beyond FINDCHIRP: Breaking the memory wall and optimal FFTs for Gravitational-Wave Matched-Filter Searches with Ratio-Filter Dechirping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $&gt;10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian Approach to the Klein-Gordon Oscillator and Supercritical Step Scattering in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(\sigma_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering.
  As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).</description>

      <title>Energetic Ceilings of Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave (GWB) is limited by the amount of rest mass available to be converted into gravitational radiation. Here we derive a population-agnostic scaling law that places an absolute energetic ceiling on stochastic backgrounds across the entire GW frequency spectrum, from nanoHertz to kilohertz. We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1\sigma$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $\Omega_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.</description>

      <title>Progenitor of the recoiling super-massive black hole RBH-1 identified using HST/JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$~Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (``wet'') merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with equal and near-equal mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of GW230529_181500 suggested the existence of more symmetric black hole-neutron star mergers where the black hole mass can be as low as 2.6 times that of the neutron star. Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \in \{1, 1/2, 1/3\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc.</description>

      <title>The quasi-normal modes of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the well-known unitary equivalence between Fokker-Planck operators and Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians, we compute the quasi-normal-mode spectrum of ultrarelativistic kinetic theories with momentum-space diffusion. We show that the collision operator reduces to a Dirac-delta Schr\"odinger problem in one spatial dimension, and to a Coulomb Schr\"odinger operator with hydrogenic spectrum in three dimensions. Finite spatial wavenumber appears as a perturbation of the associated quantum potential. The hydrodynamic mode is found to obey exact Fick-type diffusion at all real wavenumbers, whereas relativistic kinematics generically produces a continuous ballistic band in the non-hydrodynamic sector, a feature absent in the Newtonian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the spacetime torsion can modify neutrino flavor oscillations in f(T) gravity. This offers a probe of modified teleparallel gravity in astrophysical environments. By using the Dirac action in teleparallel geometry, we derive an effective coupling between the torsion vector and neutrino current. In the weak-field limit around a spherical mass, we obtain analytical expressions for torsion-induced phase shifts and effective mass-squared differences. Our results indicate that both vacuum oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in matter are affected by these torsion-based modifications. Using solar neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we constrain the teleparallel model parameters and also the neutrino-torsion coupling.</description>

      <title>On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

      <title>Approximate Decoherence, Recoherence and Records in Isolated Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.</description>

Abstract: A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and structure of gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms -- including ghost freedom in the gravitational sector -- without tuning. Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>A two-mode model for black hole evaporation and information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of large-scale structure within the standard model of cosmology is well posed only up to the onset of shell crossing, where particle trajectories appear to intersect. Beyond this point, the evolution equations become non-predictive and perturbative approaches break down. We show that in General Relativity, a matter horizon forms before caustics develop for a well-defined initial over-density on an expanding FLRW spacetime. The matter horizon was first identified by Ellis and Stoeger in 2010 as a dynamical causal boundary that encloses a sub-region of spacetime where structure formation actually takes place. We construct a multi-scale hierarchical framework for the propagation of geodesic congruences that avoids the shell-crossing singularity by cutting the spacetime at the matter horizon and glueing to another spacetime with opposite orientation. We identify a relationship between the multi-scale hierarchical framework and the cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approach, and relate the local sub-region that decouples from the Hubble flow to the region of interest in cosmological zoom-in N-body simulations. Most importantly, the multi-scale hierarchical framework provides a more robust way of implementing boundary conditions, which could benefit cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approaches.</description>

      <title>Testing the Equivalence Principle in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies have been used to measure a subtle effect predicted by Einstein: gravitational redshift. This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Carrollian limit of quadratic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Carrollian limit of the (general) quadratic gravity in four dimensions. We find that in order for the Carrollian theory to be a modification of the Carrollian limit of general relativity, the parameters in the action must depend on the speed of light in a specific way. By focusing on the leading and the next-to-leading orders in the Carrollian expansion, we show that there are four such non equivalent Carrollian theories. Imposing conditions to remove tachyons (from the linearized theory), we end up with a classification of Carrollian theories according to the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions. All modify the Carrollian limit of general relativity with quartic terms of the extrinsic curvature. To the leading order, we show that two theories are equivalent to general relativity, one to $R+R^2$ theory, and one to the general quadratic gravity. To the next-to-leading order, two are equivalent to $R+R^2$ while the other two to the general quadratic gravity. We study the two theories that are equivalent to $R+R^2$ to the leading order and write their magnetic limit actions.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Galilean and Carrollian limits of gravitational theories and application to higher derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the seemingly different methods used to derive non-Lorentzian (Galilean and Carrollian) gravitational theories from Lorentzian ones are equivalent. Specifically, the pre-nonrelativistic and the pre-ultralocal parametrizations can be constructed from the gauging of the Galilei and Carroll algebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the Carrollian limit is equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then setting the signature of the Lorentzian manifold to zero. We use this uniqueness to write a generic expansion for the curvature tensors and construct Galilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theories of gravity of finite order ranging from the $f(R)$ gravity to a completely generic higher derivative theory, the $f(g_{\mu\nu},R_{\mu\nu\sigma \rho},\nabla_{\mu})$ gravity. We present an algorithm for calculation of the $n$-th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions that transforms this problem into a constrained optimization problem. We also derive the condition under which a gravitational theory becomes a modification of general relativity in both limits simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: We prove a nonlinear characteristic $C^k$-gluing theorem for vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge for a class of characteristic hypersurfaces near static vacuum $n$-dimensional backgrounds, $n\ge 3$, with any finite $k$, with cosmological constant $ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, near Birmingham-Kottler backgrounds.

      <title>Carroll black holes in (A)dS and their higher-derivative modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Carrollian black holes corresponding to the limit of Schwarzschild-(A)dS spacetime and its higher-derivative counterpart known as Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS spacetime, which is also a static spherically symmetric vacuum solution of quadratic gravity. By analyzing motion of massive particles in these geometries, we found that: In the case of Schwarzschild-(A)dS, a (nearly) tangential particle from infinity will wind around the extremal surface with a finite number of windings depending on the impact parameter and the cosmological constant. In Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS, a particle passing close enough to the extremal surface will have an infinite number of windings; hence, it will not escape to asymptotic infinity as in Schwarzschild-(A)dS. We also calculate the thermodynamical quantities for such black holes and argue that it is analogous to an incompressible thermodynamical system with divergent entropy when the temperature goes to zero (in the strict Carroll limit). We then define a divergent specific heat that can be positive, negative, or zero.</description>

      <title>Testing modified gravity with the eccentric neutron star--black hole merger GW200105</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detections of gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the highly dynamical and strong field regime. Current tests are typically performed assuming signals from quasicircular binaries. However, the complex waveform morphology induced by orbital eccentricity can enhance our ability to probe gravity with greater precision. A recent analysis of the neutron star-black hole event GW200105 identified strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. We extend an eccentric-precessing waveform model to test alternative models with this signal by incorporating eccentric corrections induced by Brans-Dicke, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity at leading post-Newtonian order. We show that analyzing this event with a quasi-circular model leads to a false deviation from general relativity, while the inclusion of eccentricity improves the bounds on the models. Our analysis of GW200105 places tight constraints on Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, $\alpha^{1/2}_{\rm{EdGB}} \lesssim 2.38\,\text{km}$, and Brans-Dicke gravity, $\omega_{\rm{BD}} \gtrsim 3.5$, while dynamical Chern-Simons gravity remains unconstrained due to the low spin content.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes using their shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes (KBRBHs), which have a deviation parameter $B$ that captures the effect of an external magnetic field on the spacetime geometry. These spacetimes of Petrov type $D$ are asymptotically non-flat. We utilise the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to generate null geodesics and examine the crucial impact parameters for unstable photon orbits that define the black hole shadow. We carefully investigate how the magnetic field strength $B$ and spin parameter $a$ influence black hole shadows, discovering that increasing $B$ increases the shadow size while also introducing additional distortions, especially at high spins. We calculate the shadow observables, viz., area $A$ and oblateness $D$ and create contour plots in the parameter space $(a, B)$ to facilitate parameter estimation. We also investigate the dependence of the shadow on the observer's position, specifically by altering the radial coordinate $r_O$ and the inclination angle $\theta$. For far viewers, the shadow approaches its asymptotic shape, but finite-distance observers perceive substantial deviations. The energy emission rate analysis reveals that the magnetic field parameter $B$ modifies the Hawking radiation spectrum, with increasing $B$ suppressing emission via backreaction, which lowers the Hawking temperature. Our findings confirm that KBRBH shadows encode imprints of magnetic deviations, thereby offering a potential avenue to distinguish Kerr from non-Kerr spacetimes and to probe magnetic effects in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Uniform Magnetic Fields on Strong Field Gravitational Lensing by Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of a massive scalar field and a massless Dirac field in the geometry of a dilaton--de Sitter black hole. Starting from the covariant perturbation equations, we present the corresponding effective potentials and analyze their dependence on the dilaton charge, field mass, and cosmological constant. Using the WKB approximation, we compute the grey-body factors and study the associated absorption cross-sections. The results show that increasing the field mass or dilaton charge raises the effective potential barrier, leading to a suppression of transmission at low frequencies, while a larger cosmological constant lowers the barrier and enhances transmission. The partial absorption cross-sections for different multipole numbers display the expected oscillatory structure, with the lowest multipoles dominating at small frequencies. After summation over multipoles, the oscillations average out and the total cross-section interpolates between strong suppression in the infrared regime and the geometric capture limit at high frequencies. These findings provide a systematic description of scattering and absorption properties of dilaton--de Sitter black holes for both scalar and fermionic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. We show that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it is localized along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schr\"odinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.</description>

The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Holonomy in Sagnac Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of gravitational waves on a Sagnac interferometer formed by the interference of two counter-propagating beams traversing a closed spatial loop. In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect.</description>

      <title>The neutrino behavior in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee gravity around global monopole field</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the neutrino oscillation phase propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino oscillation probability is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { \mu }$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter and gravitational-wave production in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. Current searches may therefore miss a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. When focusing on a potentially precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers, the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. We then show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the overall rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark energy after DESI DR2: a challenge for $\Lambda$CDM paradigm?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck 2018, data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and finally various Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) datasets (PantheonPlus, Union3 and DESY5). For the basic and simplest interacting model we find a mild preference of the interaction at slightly more than $1\sigma$ however still within $2\sigma$, and thus no strong evidence of interaction is found. However, comparison with $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario through $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}$, Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture, namely according to $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}$ the interaction is mildly favored by most of the datasets, while the remaining statistical measures are inclined toward $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</description>

      <title>Convection signatures in early-time gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers.
  This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star.
  We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results.
  Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.</description>

Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy for nonlocal field theories displays a universal ``volume law" scaling \cite{Barbon:2008ut, Karczmarek:2013xxa, Shiba:2013jja, Pang:2014tpa} as opposed to the ``area law" scaling for local field theories. The aim of this work is to determine whether complexity displays any such an universal scaling laws. The field theories considered here are obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory by higher dimension operators introducing nonlocality, namely a dipole deformation and noncommutativity (NCSYM) by turning on world volume Kalb-Ramond $B$ field. The dual gravity backgrounds have a running dilaton, in addition to the $B$-field background, which alter AdS asymptotics. Our results capture nonlocality in the hyperscaling behavior for complexity. We also compute the subregion complexity which display phase transitions in the nonlocal field theories with the transition point being the same as that for the phase transition of entanglement entropy \cite{Karczmarek:2013xxa}. These new results dovetail nicely with our findings from our previous works \cite{Chakraborty:2020fpt, Katoch:2022hdf, Bhattacharyya:2022ren} on other lower dimensional nonlocal field theories such as little string theories (LSTs) and warped conformal field theories (WCFTs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$ deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side. The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.</description>
