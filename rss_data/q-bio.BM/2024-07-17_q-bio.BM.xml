      <title>Observation of Aerosolization-induced Morphological Changes in Viral Capsids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-stranded RNA viruses co-assemble their capsid with the genome and variations in capsid structures can have significant functional relevance. In particular, viruses need to respond to a dehydrating environment to prevent genomic degradation and remain active upon rehydration. Theoretical work has predicted low-energy buckling transitions in icosahedral capsids which could protect the virus from further dehydration. However, there has been no direct experimental evidence, nor molecular mechanism, for such behaviour. Here we observe this transition using X-ray single particle imaging of MS2 bacteriophages after aerosolization. Using a combination of machine learning tools, we classify hundreds of thousands of single particle diffraction patterns to learn the structural landscape of the capsid morphology as a function of time spent in the aerosol phase. We found a previously unreported compact conformation as well as intermediate structures which suggest an incoherent buckling transition which does not preserve icosahedral symmetry. Finally, we propose a mechanism of this buckling, where a single 19-residue loop is destabilised, leading to the large observed morphology change. Our results provide experimental evidence for a mechanism by which viral capsids protect themselves from dehydration. In the process, these findings also demonstrate the power of single particle X-ray imaging and machine learning methods in studying biomolecular structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Context-Guided Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Molecular and Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have the potential to accelerate key steps in the discovery of novel molecular therapeutics and materials. Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, excelling at unconditional sample generation and, with data-driven guidance, conditional generation within their training domain. Reliably sampling from high-value regions beyond the training data, however, remains an open challenge -- with current methods predominantly focusing on modifying the diffusion process itself. In this paper, we develop context-guided diffusion (CGD), a simple plug-and-play method that leverages unlabeled data and smoothness constraints to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of guided diffusion models. We demonstrate that this approach leads to substantial performance gains across various settings, including continuous, discrete, and graph-structured diffusion processes with applications across drug discovery, materials science, and protein design.</description>

      <title>SPIN: SE(3)-Invariant Physics Informed Network for Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is crucial for rapid and efficient drug development. Recently, the importance of predicting binding affinity has led to increased attention on research that models the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand complexes using graph neural networks to predict binding affinity. However, traditional methods often fail to accurately model the complex's spatial information or rely solely on geometric features, neglecting the principles of protein-ligand binding. This can lead to overfitting, resulting in models that perform poorly on independent datasets and ultimately reducing their usefulness in real drug development. To address this issue, we propose SPIN, a model designed to achieve superior generalization by incorporating various inductive biases applicable to this task, beyond merely training on empirical data from datasets. For prediction, we defined two types of inductive biases: a geometric perspective that maintains consistent binding affinity predictions regardless of the complexs rotations and translations, and a physicochemical perspective that necessitates minimal binding free energy along their reaction coordinate for effective protein-ligand binding. These prior knowledge inputs enable the SPIN to outperform comparative models in benchmark sets such as CASF-2016 and CSAR HiQ. Furthermore, we demonstrated the practicality of our model through virtual screening experiments and validated the reliability and potential of our proposed model based on experiments assessing its interpretability.</description>

      <title>Repurformer: Transformers for Repurposing-Aware Molecule Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating as diverse molecules as possible with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery research, which invokes many approaches based on deep generative models today. Despite recent advancements in these models, particularly in variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), Transformers, and diffusion models, a significant challenge known as \textit{the sample bias problem} remains. This problem occurs when generated molecules targeting the same protein tend to be structurally similar, reducing the diversity of generation. To address this, we propose leveraging multi-hop relationships among proteins and compounds. Our model, Repurformer, integrates bi-directional pretraining with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and low-pass filtering (LPF) to capture complex interactions and generate diverse molecules. A series of experiments on BindingDB dataset confirm that Repurformer successfully creates substitutes for anchor compounds that resemble positive compounds, increasing diversity between the anchor and generated compounds.</description>

      <title>Unzipping of knotted DNA via nanopore translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA unzipping by nanopore translocation has implications in diverse contexts, from polymer physics to single-molecule manipulation to DNA-enzyme interactions in biological systems. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model of DNA to address the nanopore unzipping of DNA filaments that are knotted. This previously unaddressed problem is motivated by the fact that DNA knots inevitably occur in isolated equilibrated filaments and in vivo. We study how different types of tight knots in the DNA segment just outside the pore impact unzipping at different driving forces. We establish three main results. First, knots do not significantly affect the unzipping process at low forces. However, knotted DNAs unzip more slowly and heterogeneously than unknotted ones at high forces. Finally, we observe that the microscopic origin of the hindrance typically involves two concurrent causes: the topological friction of the DNA chain sliding along its knotted contour and the additional friction originating from the entanglement with the newly unzipped DNA. The results reveal a previously unsuspected complexity of the interplay of DNA topology and unzipping, which should be relevant for interpreting nanopore-based single-molecule unzipping experiments and improving the modeling of DNA transactions in vivo.</description>

      <title>ProLLaMA: A Protein Language Model for Multi-Task Protein Language Processing</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Under the premise that protein sequences constitute the protein language, Protein Language Models(PLMs) have advanced the field of protein engineering. However, as of now, unlike LLMs in NLP, PLMs cannot handle the protein understanding task and the protein generation task simultaneously in the Protein Language Processing (PLP) field. This prompts us to delineate the inherent limitations in current PLMs: (i) the lack of natural language capabilities, (ii) insufficient instruction understanding, and (iii) high training resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a training framework to transform any general LLM into a PLM capable of handling multiple PLP tasks. To improve training efficiency, we propose Protein Vocabulary Pruning (PVP) for general LLMs. We construct a multi-task instruction dataset containing 13 million samples with superfamily information, facilitating better modeling of protein sequence-function landscapes. Through these methods, we develop the ProLLaMA model, the first known PLM to handle multiple PLP tasks simultaneously. Experiments show that ProLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results in the unconditional protein sequence generation task. In the controllable protein sequence generation task, ProLLaMA can design novel proteins with desired functionalities. As for the protein understanding task, ProLLaMA achieves a 62\% exact match rate in superfamily prediction.

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>
