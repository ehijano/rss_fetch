      <title>Investigating the effect of non-resonant background variation on the CARS data analysis and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: : Non-resonant background (NRB) plays a significant role in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopic applications. All the recent works primarily focused on removing the NRB using different deep learning methods, and only one study explored the effect of NRB. Hence, in this work, we systematically investigated the impact of NRB variation on Raman signal retrieval. The NRB is simulated as a linear function with different strengths relative to the resonant Raman signal, and the variance also changed for each NRB strength. The resonant part of nonlinear susceptibility is extracted from real experimental Raman data; hence, the simulated CARS data better approximate the experimental CARS spectra. Then, the corresponding Raman signal is retrieved by four different methods: maximum entropy method (MEM), Kramers-Kronig (KK), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Pearson correlation measurements and principal component analysis combined with linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) modelling revealed that MEM and KK methods have an edge over LSTM and CNN for higher NRB strengths. It is also demonstrated that normalizing the input data favors LSTM and CNN predictions. In contrast, background removal from the predictions significantly influenced Pearson correlation but not the classification accuracies for MEM and KK. This comprehensive study is done for the first time to the best of our knowledge and has the potential to impact the CARS spectroscopy and microscopy applications in different areas.</description>

      <title>New approach for the incoherent and coherent combination of Gaussian laser beams and observation of the spatial thinning of the combined beams by modes phase locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new configuration and theoretical approach for the study of the incoherent and coherent combination of Gaussian laser beams which allows us to calculate the combined intensity at every point in space, this new approach consists of directing all the lasers towards a chosen point, which is the meeting point of all the combined lasers, this method makes it possible to obtain in the case of an incoherent combination an intensity of Gaussian shape without the existence of secondary intensity lobes at the focusing plan, and in the case of a coherent combination, we observe a spatial thinning of the combined beams with a greater intensity, which depends on the numerical aperture of the system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear effects and non-Hermitian phenomena unveil additional intricate facets in topological matter physics. They can naturally intertwine to enable advanced functionalities in topoelectrical circuits and photonic structures. Here, we illustrate the subtle interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity by examining the characteristics of small wave perturbations on the background of the self-induced topological edge state in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We demonstrate that their underlying physics is captured by the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, which features nonreciprocal coupling terms and entails unconventional time-dependent field localization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights into charge transfer plasmon lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spectral and temporal dynamics of charge transfer plasmon resonances that emerge in conductively connected plasmonic nanoparticles is crucial for exploiting their potentials for enhanced infrared spectroscopy and optical computing. In this article, we present a theoretical study based on classical electromagnetism to describe the spectral signature and dephasing time of charge transfer plasmons. By fitting the scattering curves and near-field amplitude oscillations, we determine the spectral linewidth and lifetime of charge transfer plasmons in conductively connected gold nanodisk dimers. We find that, compared with the well-known particle plasmons and dimer plasmons, charge transfer plasmons have a longer lifetime, which can be further extended by manipulating the geometric parameters of nanojunction and nanoparticles. Moreover, quantitative analyses of the optical near-field amplitude reveal that charge transfer plasmon modes oscillate completely out of phase with particle plasmon and dimer plasmon modes. The dephasing time and charge transfer rate are found to be on a few femtosecond timescale, implying that conductively connected plasmonic nanoparticles hold great promise as channels for coherent transfer of energy and information in future all-optical computing devices.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-induced $Q$-factor enhancement in waveguide-coupled surface lattice resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractively coupled nanoparticle arrays are promising candidates for helping to flatten many photonic devices such as lasers, lenses, and metrology instruments. Their performance, however, is directly linked with the size of the metasurfaces, limiting their applicability in nanophotonic applications. Here, we dramatically reduce array sizes of high-$Q$-factor metasurfaces by utilizing strongly dispersive media. The effect is demonstrated by theoretically and numerically studying periodic arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles embedded inside Bragg-reflector waveguides. We demonstrate array dimensions reduction up to two orders of magnitude while still achieving ultra-high $Q$-factors in excess of 10$^4$.</description>

      <title>Image-based wavefront correction using model-free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical aberrations prevent telescopes from reaching their theoretical diffraction limit. Once estimated, these aberrations can be compensated for using deformable mirrors in a closed loop. Focal plane wavefront sensing enables the estimation of the aberrations on the complete optical path, directly from the images taken by the scientific sensor. However, current focal plane wavefront sensing methods rely on physical models whose inaccuracies may limit the overall performance of the correction. The aim of this study is to develop a data-driven method using model-free reinforcement learning to automatically perform the estimation and correction of the aberrations, using only phase diversity images acquired around the focal plane as inputs. We formulate the correction problem within the framework of reinforcement learning and train an agent on simulated data. We show that the method is able to reliably learn an efficient control strategy for various realistic conditions. Our method also demonstrates robustness to a wide range of noise levels.</description>

      <title>Broadband Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion in Reconfigurable Poled Linearly-Uncoupled Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a periodically poled structure composed of two linearly uncoupled resonators that are nonlinearly coupled via a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The device does not require dispersion engineering to achieve efficient doubly-resonant SPDC and, unlike the case of a single resonator, one can reconfigure the system to generate photon pairs over a bandwidth of hundreds of nm. We consider the case of SPDC pumped at 775 nm in a periodically poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) device compatible with up-to-date technological platforms. We demonstrate pair generation rates of up to 250 MHz/mW pump power for a single resonance and integrated pair generation rates of up to 100 THz/mW pump power over 170 nm. When properly reconfigured, a single device can efficiently generate over a bandwidth of some 300 nm, covering the S, C, L, and U infrared bands.</description>

      <title>Multi-heterodyne differential absorption lidar based on dual-comb spectroscopy for simultaneous greenhouse gas and wind speed measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study [1], we demonstrated a multi-heterodyne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) for greenhouse gas monitoring utilizing solid targets. The multi-frequency absorption measurement was achieved using electro-optic dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) with a minimal number of comb teeth to maximize the optical power per tooth. In this work, we examine the lidar's working principle and architecture. Additionally, we present measurements of atmospheric CO2 at 1572 nm over a 1.4 km optical path conducted in summer 2023. Furthermore, we show that, due to the high power per comb tooth, multi-frequency Doppler wind speed measurements can be performed using the DCS signal from aerosol backscattering. This enables simultaneous radial wind speed and path-average gas concentration measurements, offering promising prospects for novel concepts of tunable multi-frequency lidar systems capable of simultaneously monitoring wind speed and gas concentrations.

      <title>Cascaded multi-phonon stimulated Raman scattering near second-harmonic-generation in thin-film lithium niobate microdisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality microresonators can greatly enhance light-matter interactions and are excellent platforms for studying nonlinear optics. Wavelength conversion through nonlinear processes is the key to many applications of integrated optics. The stimulated Raman scattering process can extend the emission wavelength of a laser source to a wider range. Lithium niobate, as a Raman active crystalline material, has remarkable potential for wavelength conversion. Here, we demonstrate the generation of cascaded multi-phonon Raman signals near the second-harmonic-generation peak in X-cut thin-film lithium niobate microdisk. Fine tuning of the specific cascaded Raman spectral lines has also been made by changing the pump wavelength. Raman lines can reach wavelength up to about 80 nm away from the SHG signal. We realize the SFG process associated with Raman signals in the visible range as well. Our work extends the use of WGM microresonators as effective optical upconversion wavelength converters in nonlinear optical applications.</description>

      <title>Bending Light via Transverse Momentum Exchange: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a transport model for the paraxial propagation of vector beams. Of particular importance is the appearance of a new transverse momentum term proportional to the linear polarization angle gradient imparted to the beam during the beam preparation process. The model predicts that during propagation, this new momentum will be exchanged for classical transverse momentum, thereby causing the beam to accelerate. We observe the momentum exchange in experiment by designing the polarization profile in such a way as to cause the beam centroid to follow a parabolic path through free space.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal chiral forces in photonic integrated waveguides to separate particles with realistically small chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral optical forces exhibit opposite signs for the two enantiomeric versions of a chiral molecule or particle. If large enough, these forces might be able to separate enantiomers all optically, which would find numerous applications in different fields, from pharmacology to chemistry. Longitudinal chiral forces are especially promising for tackling the challenging scenario of separating particles of realistically small chiralities. In this work, we study the longitudinal chiral forces arising in dielectric integrated waveguides when the quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes are combined as well as their application to separate absorbing and non-absorbing chiral particles. We show that chiral gradient forces dominate in the scenario of beating of non-denegerate TE and TM modes when considering non-absorbing particles. For absorbing particles, the superposition of degenerate TE and TM modes can lead to chiral forces that are kept along the whole waveguide length. We accompany the calculations of the forces with particle tracking simulations for specific radii and chirality parameters. We show that longitudinal forces can separate non-absorbing chiral nanoparticles in water even for relatively low values of the particle chirality and absorbing particles with arbitrarily low values of chirality can be effectively separated after enough interaction time.</description>

      <title>PIC2O-Sim: A Physics-Inspired Causality-Aware Dynamic Convolutional Neural Operator for Ultra-Fast Photonic Device FDTD Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which is important in photonic hardware design flow, is widely adopted to solve time-domain Maxwell equations. However, FDTD is known for its prohibitive runtime cost, taking minutes to hours to simulate a single device. Recently, AI has been applied to realize orders-of-magnitude speedup in partial differential equation (PDE) solving. However, AI-based FDTD solvers for photonic devices have not been clearly formulated. Directly applying off-the-shelf models to predict the optical field dynamics shows unsatisfying fidelity and efficiency since the model primitives are agnostic to the unique physical properties of Maxwell equations and lack algorithmic customization. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the synergy between neural operator designs and the physical property of Maxwell equations and introduce a physics-inspired AI-based FDTD prediction framework PIC2O-Sim which features a causality-aware dynamic convolutional neural operator as its backbone model that honors the space-time causality constraints via careful receptive field configuration and explicitly captures the permittivity-dependent light propagation behavior via an efficient dynamic convolution operator. Meanwhile, we explore the trade-offs among prediction scalability, fidelity, and efficiency via a multi-stage partitioned time-bundling technique in autoregressive prediction. Multiple key techniques have been introduced to mitigate iterative error accumulation while maintaining efficiency advantages during autoregressive field prediction. Extensive evaluations on three challenging photonic device simulation tasks have shown the superiority of our PIC2O-Sim method, showing 51.2% lower roll-out prediction error, 23.5 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art neural operators, providing 300-600x higher simulation speed than an open-source FDTD numerical solver.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic polarization sensing of electrostatic superlattice potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmon polaritons are formed by coupling light with delocalized electrons. The half-light and half-matter nature of plasmon polaritons endows them with unparalleled tunability via a range of parameters, such as dielectric environments and carrier density. Therefore, plasmon polaritons are expected to be tuned when in proximity to polar materials since the carrier density is tuned by an electrostatic potential; conversely, the plasmon polariton response might enable the sensing of polarization. Here, we use infrared nano-imaging and nano-photocurrent measurements to investigate heterostructures composed of graphene and twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-BN), with alternating polarization in a triangular network of moir\'e stacking domains. We observe that the carrier density and the corresponding plasmonic response of graphene are modulated by polar domains in t-BN. In addition, we demonstrate that the nanometer-wide domain walls of graphene moir\'es superlattices, created by the polar domains of t-BN, provide momenta to assist the plasmonic excitations. Furthermore, our studies establish that the plasmon of graphene could function as a delicate sensor for polarization textures. The evolution of polarization textures in t-BN under uniform electric fields is tomographically examined via plasmonic imaging. Strikingly, no noticeable polarization switching is observed under applied electric fields up to 0.23 V/nm, at variance with transport reports. Our nano-images unambiguously reveal that t-BN with triangular domains acts like a ferrielectric, rather than ferroelectric claimed by many previous studies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast (10 GHz) mid-IR modulator based on ultra-fast electrical switching of the light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a free-space amplitude modulator for mid-infrared radiation (lambda=9.6 um) that operates at room temperature up to at least 20 GHz (above the -3dB cutoff frequency measured at 8.2 GHz). The device relies on the ultra-fast transition between weak and strong-coupling regimes induced by the variation of the applied bias voltage. Such transition induces a modulation of the device reflectivity. It is made of a semiconductor heterostructure enclosed in a judiciously designed array of metal-metal optical resonators, that - all-together - behave as an electrically tunable surface. At negative bias, it operates in the weak light-matter coupling regime. Upon application of an appropriate positive bias, the quantum wells populate with electrons and the device transitions to the strong-coupling regime. The modulator transmission keeps linear with input RF power in the 0dBm - 9dBm range. The increase of optical powers up to 25 mW exhibit a weak beginning saturation a little bit below.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled photonic circuits of field-induced dipolaritons with huge nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrically controlled photonic circuits hold promise for information technologies with greatly improved energy efficiency and quantum information processing capabilities. However, weak nonlinearity and electrical response of typical photonic materials have been two critical challenges. Therefore hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton-polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically-gated waveguide architecture for dipolar-polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically-controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically-tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar-polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and anti-blockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are explained using a simple density-dependent polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field, with an order of magnitude enhancement of the nonlinearities as compared to fixed dipoles. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.</description>

      <title>Enhanced self-collimation effect by low rotational symmetry in hexagonal lattice photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present the design of a photonic crystal (PC) structure with a hexagonal lattice, where adjustments to the PC unit cell symmetry reveal an all-angle self-collimation (SC) effect. By optimizing opto-geometric parameters, such as the rotational angle of auxiliary rods and adjacent distances, we analyze the SC property in detail, leveraging group velocity dispersion (GVD) and third-order dispersion (TOD) characteristics. We also investigate the relationship between symmetry properties and their influence on dispersion characteristics. Through symmetry manipulation, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing light collimation and confinement in the proposed configurations. The PC structure with a $C_1$ symmetry group exhibits all-angle SC effect within the range of $a/\lambda=0.652$ and $a/\lambda=0.668$ normalized frequencies, with a bandwidth of $\Delta\omega/\omega_c = 2.4\%$. Further breaking the symmetry, transforming from $C_1$ to $C_2$ group symmetry, enhances the SC bandwidth to $\Delta\omega/\omega_c = 6.5\%$ and reveals the perfect linear equi-frequency contours (EFC) at two different frequency bands: all-angle SC between $a/\lambda=0.616$ and $a/\lambda=0.656$ normalized frequencies in the \nth{4} transverse magnetic (TM) band and between $a/\lambda=0.712$ and $a/\lambda=0.760$ in the \nth{5} TM band. Additionally, we propose a composite/hybrid PC structure resembling $C_2$ group symmetry, where two auxiliary rods are replaced by rectangular photonic wires with the same refractive index and width equal to the diameter of auxiliary rods. This hybrid structure exhibits an all-angle SC effect with an operating bandwidth of $\Delta\omega/\omega_c = 11.7\%$, displays near-zero GVD and TOD performance, and offers enhanced robustness against potential fabrication precision issues.</description>

      <title>Monitoring cis-to-trans isomerization of azobenzene using Brillouin microscopy</title>

Abstract: Brillouin spectroscopy is commonly used to study the acoustic properties of materials. Here we explored its feasibility in studying the photoinduced isomerization of azobenzene. The isomerization of azobenzene changes the solution elastic modulus, and Brillouin scattering is sensitive to these changes. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the photoswitching of azobenzene in DMSO using our home-made VIPA-based high-resolution optical Brillouin spectrometer, and confirmed the results by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. Remarkable Brillouin frequency shift variations were quantitatively recorded upon irradiation, and it was found that this method can indeed be used to monitor the isomerization process in situ. Importantly, our strategy also allows us to provide the relationship between the ratio of trans- and cis- azobenzene and the Brillouin frequency shift. This shows that Brillouin spectroscopy has broad prospects for the characterization of azobenzene isomerization and other photo responsive materials.</description>

      <title>Even-order optical harmonics generated from centrosymmetric-material metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation of even-order optical harmonics requires noncentrosymmetric structures being conventionally observed in crystals lacking the center of inversion. In centrosymmetric systems, even-order harmonics may arise, e.g., at surfaces but such effects are usually very weak. Here we observe optical harmonics up to 4-th order generated under the normal incidence from centrosymmetric dielectric metasurfaces empowered by resonances. We design silicon metasurfaces supporting optical quasibound states in the continuum and guided-mode resonances, and demonstrate the enhancement of second-harmonic signals by over three orders of magnitude compared to nonresonant thin films. Under the optimal conditions, the brightness of the second harmonic approaches that of the third harmonic, and the 4th-order harmonic becomes detectable.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and classical nonseparability convertible from orthogonal polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonclassicality of a macroscopic single-mode optical superposition state is potentially convertible into entanglement, when the state is mixed with the vacuum on a beam splitter. Considering light beams with polarization degree of freedom in Euclidean space as coherent product states in a bipartite Hilbert space, we propose a method to convert the two orthogonal polarizations into simultaneous entanglement and classical nonseparability through nonclassicality in the superpositions of coherent and displaced Fock states. Equivalent Bell state emerges from the resulted superpositions and the proportion of mixed entanglement and nonseparablity is determined by the displacement amplitudes along the polarization directions. We characterize the state nonclassicality via features in Wigner distributions and propose an experimental method for generating these states and measuring them via homodyne tomography.</description>

      <title>Encoding quantum phase-space with classical wireless microwave constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for enabling seamless transfer of digital information from classical microwave domain to the quantum optical domain in wireless-to-optical converters. A quantum mechanical network model is introduced to characterize microwave-to-optical digital information mapping in antenna-coupled electro-optic modulator-based converters. Design guidelines are discussed to maximize the information mapping strength. The derived model is then extended to show phase-space encoding of optical coherent-states with classical wireless microwave constellation. Further, the challenge of inter-symbol overlap in the encoded quantum optical phase-space due to quadrature fluctuations is highlighted. The possibility of erroneous phase-space encoding due to quadrature fluctuations is pointed out, followed by a potential mitigation technique. The presented framework also lays the groundwork for encoding other non-classical states of light such as squeezed states, and hence forms the basis for bridging classical microwave and quantum optical links in the near future.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of negative group velocity</title>

Abstract: Distortion free negative group velocity pulse propagation is demonstrated in a rare-earth-ion-doped-crystal (RE) through the creation of a carefully designed spectral absorption structure in the inhomogeneous profile of Eu:YSO and subsequently inverting it. The properties of the RE system make it particularly well suited for this since it supports the creation of very sharp, arbitrarily tailored spectral features, which can be coherently inverted by a single pulse thanks to the long coherence time of the transition. All together these properties allow for a large time advancement of pulses without causing distortion. A pulse advancement of 10.9% with respect to the pulse full-width-half-maximum was achieved corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 0.05. This to our knowledge is the largest time-bandwidth product achieved, with negligible shape distortion and attenuation. Our results show that the rare-earth platform is a powerful test bed for superluminal propagation in particular and dispersion profile programming in general</description>
