      <title>Towards precision quantitative measurement of radiation reaction within the classical radiation-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation reaction (RR) is a fundamental yet incompletely validated process in laser-particle interactions, since it lacks quantitatively definitive experimental verifications, especially the transition from classical to quantum regime. Herein, we propose a novel experimental scenario for investigating radiation RR within the classical radiation-dominated regime (CRDR), via the collision of a high-intensity petawatt-class laser with a tens-of-MeV electron beam from a LINAC. This approach enables access to a distinct parameter regime wherein RR dominates electron dynamics while quantum effects remain modest. Numerical simulations demonstrate that three key observables exist for identifying the RR within this CRDR regime: (i) quantitative measurement of energy spectra to validate the quantum correction factor; (ii) control of the collision time delay with charge-counting to map intensity dependence of RR; and (iii) verification of large angle ($90^\circ$) photon emission under the recoil condition $2\gamma \gtrsim a_0$. These experimental measurements will establish the benchmarks for RR models spanning the classical-to-quantum regime, thereby providing critical insights into fundamental strong-field quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometrical optical activity induced by a continuous distribution of screw dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light propagation in a medium with uniform torsion, modeled as a continuum of screw dislocations within the geometric theory of defects. By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $\Delta\theta = \Omega\rho L$, linear in the dislocation density $\Omega$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $\rho$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $\Delta n = 2c\Omega\rho/\omega$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses.</description>

      <title>Rotation angle sensing via polarization-dependent mode superposition in a hollow-core fiber with two-fold symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCF) have experienced tremendous advancements recently, leading to remarkable demonstrations of transmission loss reduction and deeper understanding of their guidance fundamentals. Indeed, this progress has entailed investigations into various HCPCF designs, allowing for attaining diverse properties of interest such as ultralow loss, polarization filtering, and specific modal operation. Among HCPCFs with tailored modal characteristics are fibers displaying microstructures with modified symmetry, which allow for changing the loss hierarchy between the guided modes, hence favoring the propagation of higher-order modes. In this context, we here demonstrate the realization of an angle sensor utilizing a tubular HCPCF with a two-fold symmetric cladding. This specific fiber design enables the generation of an output intensity profile resulting from the superposition of LP01 and LP11-like modes, whose excitation and resulting output intensity spatial distribution are dependent on the polarization angle of the incident light. Thus, by rotating the input beam's polarization and analyzing the evolution of the resulting output profile, we characterized a rotation angle sensor exhibiting a sensitivity of 25 counts/degree and an estimated resolution of 0.3{\deg}. We understand that this work broadens the framework of HCPCF applications, demonstrating that symmetry-modified hollow-core fibers can act as a promising platform for advanced sensing scenarios and polarimetric characterizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and chimera-like states of nanoemitters coupled to plasmon-polaritons in a lattice of conducting nanorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate semiclassical dynamics of the optical field produced by quantum nanoemitters (NEs) embedded in a periodic lattice of conducting nanorings (NRs), in which plasmon polaritons (PPs) are excited. The coupling between PPs and NEs through the radiated optical field leads to establishment of a significant cross-correlation between NEs, so that their internal dynamics (photocurrent affected by the laser irradiation) depends on the NR's plasma frequency $\omega _{p}$. The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $\omega _{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states. A fit of the dependence of the critical current on $\omega _{p}$ is found, being in agreement with results of numerical simulations. The critical effect may help to design new optical devices, using dispersive nanolattices which are made available by modern nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-optical theory of the few femtosecond nonlinear optical response of Drude metals with a non-parabolic conduction band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an energy-space density matrix framework to investigate the interaction of extremely short optical pulses (ESPs) with transparent conducting oxides (TCOs). This approach captures not only electron populations, material polarization, and the permittivity, but also the quantum coherences between states. Compared to traditional momentum-space models, the energy-space formulation offers substantial computational simplification while retaining accuracy. Building on but going beyond the scope of Ref.~\cite{single_cycle_nlty_Letter}, we focus on dynamical features previously unexplored. Our formulation reveals clear signatures of quantum coherence in the net absorption dynamics and highlights the emergence of strong excited-state absorption under intense excitation. It also clarifies that spontaneous emission can be neglected in this regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of pump pulse intensity on the local field's duration, spectral broadening and shift, and phase induced by carrier dynamics, highlighting the absorptive nature of the nonlinear response. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding nonlinear light-matter interaction in dispersive, low-density electron systems driven far from equilibrium by intense broadband excitation.</description>

      <title>Generation and Enhancement of Persistent Nanoscale Magnetization in All-Dielectric Metasurfaces by Optically Injected and Localized Free Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying dielectric metasurfaces supporting sharp optical resonances with a non-trivial electromagnetic field distribution represent a unique platform for realizing temporal interfaces for metasurface-guided waves (MGWs). Rapidly changing metasurface resonance enables frequency conversion and temporal scattering of a concurrently propagating MGW. Using analytical methods and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized free-carrier generation can be engineered to produce frequency-shifted, time-refracted, and reflected infrared MGWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The origin and influence of non-cavity modes in a micropillar Bragg microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the photonic environment of emitters is essential to the design of classical and quantum light sources. We study the case of a dipole-like emitter in a cylindrical pillar etched into a planar Bragg microcavity, which is a common design of quantum-dot single photon source. In addition to the well-known cavity modes created by the high-reflectivity of the Bragg mirrors at small in-plane wavevectors, we show the presence of broad spectral features that play a key role in controlling photon collection efficiency and Purcell enhancement. These non-cavity modes are insensitive to the periodic index modulation of the Bragg reflectors, but arise from the cylindrical pillar geometry, as we show by comparison with simulations of uniform pillars, which reproduce the non-cavity modes. This approach provides a tool for understanding and modelling these often-disregarded decay channels as a function of source height, cavity dimensions and surface layers.</description>

      <title>Optical losses in pure crystalline silicon in the IR band measured using WGM microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for semiconductor technology for crystalline silicon of the highest purity and homogeneity has provided samples exhibiting low optical absorption in the infrared range. Such silicon has become the basis for photonic elements in the telecommunication band, including high-Q microresonators, which are particularly important. However, at longer wavelengths, the loss mechanisms have not yet been sufficiently studied. At the same time, this range is extremely important, especially for biological and medical applications and for fundamental research. We used optical microresonators with whispering gallery modes made from various types of silicon crystals as a tool to study the loss mechanisms. The study involved the pump wavelengths 1.5, 2.6, 6.1, and 8.6 $\mu$m and the maximum measured Q-factors were $1.5\cdot10^9$, $5\cdot10^8$, $1.6\cdot10^7$, and $5\cdot10^4$, respectively. We showed that the conductivity type does not noticeably influence the optical losses, while resistivity and the growing method are defining factors. Our study confirms the utility of WGM microresonators as loss measurement tools and provides significant potential for the development of silicon microresonator-based photonics in the mid-IR band.</description>

      <title>Study on Light Propagation through Space-Time Random Media via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, the theory of stochastic partial differential equations is applied to the propagation of light fields in space-time random media. By modeling the fluctuation of refractive index's square of the media as a random field, we demonstrate that the hyperbolic Anderson model is applicable to describing the propagation of light fields in such media. Additionally, several new quantitative characterizations of the stochastic properties that govern the light fields are derived. Furthermore, the validity of the theoretical framework and corresponding results is experimentally verified by analyzing the statistical properties of the propagated light fields after determining the spatial and temporal stochastic features of the random media. The results presented here provide a more accurate theoretical basis for better understanding random phenomena in emerging domains such as free-space optical communication, detection, and imaging in transparent random media. The study could also have practical guiding significance for experimental system design in these fields.</description>

      <title>Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Terahertz emission and detection using Ge-on-Si photoconductive antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium-on-Silicon (Ge-on-Si) is a promising, CMOS-compatible platform for integrated terahertz (THz) photonics, offering a low-cost alternative to III-V semiconductors. A primary challenge for Ge-based photoconductive antennas (PCAs), however, has been the long carrier lifetime of bulk Ge, preventing its use as a detector. Here, we demonstrate that amorphous Ge (a-Ge) films overcome this limitation, possessing inherent ultrashort carrier lifetimes ~ 1.11-1.38 ps. We leverage this property to demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, coherent THz pulse detection using undoped a-Ge-on-Si PCAs. We present a comparative study of devices fabricated on a-Ge films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and DC magnetron sputtering. The PECVD-Ge device, with better homogeneity and a smoother morphology in the films, demonstrates superior performance for both THz emission and detection. As an emitter, the PECVD-Ge PCA achieves a 40 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a bandwidth of ~ 3 THz. As a detector, it achieves a 32 dB SNR and a ~ 2 THz bandwidth, representing a ~2.5-fold increase in detected signal amplitude over the sputtered-Ge device. These results establish amorphous Ge-on-Si as a viable and scalable platform for both THz generation and detection, paving the way for fully integrated Si-based THz time-domain systems.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning 10-GHz Er-doped solid-state optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs provide a phase-coherent interface between optical and microwave domains, underpinning advances in precision metrology, spectroscopy, and time-frequency transfer. Most conventional comb architectures are limited to sub-gigahertz repetition rates, constraining integration and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a compact, 10-GHz Er-doped solid-state frequency comb operating near the 1550 nm telecommunications window. The system, assembled entirely from commercially available components, produces a coherent spectrum spanning from 1150 nm to 2350 nm with exceptionally low intensity and phase noise. Full frequency stabilization of both pulse repetition and carrier envelope offset frequencies is demonstrated with respect to an RF reference. Comprehensive characterization reveals performance exceeding that of previously reported solid-state combs in power-per-mode and noise suppression. These results establish a robust and accessible platform for multi-gigahertz-repetition-rate comb synthesis, bridging laboratory-grade performance with practical deployment in optical communication, precision timing, and astronomical instrumentation.</description>

      <title>General in situ feedback control of cascaded liquid crystal spatial light modulators for structured field generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascaded liquid crystal spatial light modulators provide a versatile strategy for the generation of structured light and matter fields, with applications including optical communications, photonic computing, and topological field engineering. However, experimental imperfections, such as temperature-dependent liquid crystal response, variations between individual pixels, and alignment errors, present significant engineering challenges in generating high-quality fields. Moreover, changes in experimental conditions over time mean that calibrating each component once is insufficient for maintaining long-term, high-quality field generation. To address this, we present a general engineering approach based on a bespoke, physically informed, and manifold-constrained gradient-descent scheme that enables in situ feedback control, compensating for such errors in real time without the need to alter the experimental setup. We further demonstrate the correction efficacy of our proposed strategy through experiments in both spatially varying light and matter field generation, including scenarios in which complex vectorial aberrations are artificially introduced into the setup. Together, these demonstrations underscore the practicality of our method and its suitability for deployment in real-world experimental environments, paving the way for robust operation of cascaded architectures for structured field generation.</description>

      <title>Resolving topological obstructions to vectorial structured field control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of structured matter, such as optical retarders, for vectorial control is a well-established and widely employed technique in modern optics, and has driven continued advances in the manipulation of complex, spatially varying vectorial fields. However, achieving arbitrary field conversion typically requires the use of cascaded elements, as intrinsic physical and fabrication constraints fundamentally limit individual devices to a restricted subset of transformations. This results in an overall continuous transformation potentially failing to be continuous at the level of the parameters of the cascade, leading to detrimental engineering consequences such as the introduction of complex, discontinuous aberrations that disrupt important topological properties of the underlying matter field. In this work, we establish a novel mathematical framework for analyzing the topological difficulties that emerge in the decomposition of an overall transformation into individual layers, and for determining the minimal depth required to overcome them. The strategy introduced provides a general pathway for optimizing designs for vectorial field control and matter field generation, with particular significance for the manipulation of topological phases in optical polarization fields, such as Stokes skyrmions, where continuity is of vital importance.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in the complex nonlinear refractive index of a homogeneous and isotropic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the permittivity, $\epsilon(\omega)$, for a medium with a quadratic electro-optic effect, modeling it as a Duffing oscillator. The nonlinear refractive index $n(\omega, E(\omega))$ and the nonlinear absorption coefficient $\alpha(\omega, E(\omega))$ exhibit hysteresis when the light intensity is varied [here $E(\omega)$ is the electric field strength at angular frequency $\omega$], and when the light frequency is varied. $n(\omega, E(\omega))$ can be negative when the resonances in the permittivity and permeability are close to one another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance a phase-space theory of partially coherent accelerating, non-diffracting beams employing the Wigner distribution function (WDF). We derive a general expression for the WDF of any accelerating, diffraction-free beam of arbitrary degree of spatial coherence and find an elegant closed-form expression for the WDF of such beam with a Gaussian energy spectrum of noise. We also show how partially coherent accelerating beams of finite power can be constructed within the Wigner picture.</description>

      <title>Metagratings on Low-Cost Substrates for Efficient Anomalous Reflection: Addressing Dielectric Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework and practical methodology for designing high-efficiency metagratings (MGs), sparse periodic arrangements of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms), on low-cost dielectric substrates with non-negligible losses. The formulation incorporates these losses and exploits multiple degrees of freedom to optimize beam manipulation efficiency within a simple realistic printed-circuit-board (PCB) configuration. Importantly, the various loss mechanisms are analyzed using a judiciously devised equivalent circuit model, providing insights on their respective contributions. We validate our theory by designing, fabricating, and experimentally characterizing an efficient FR4-based anomalous reflection PCB MG, demonstrating good agreement between analytical predictions, full-wave simulations, and laboratory measurements. This work opens avenues for realizing efficient, low-profile, beam manipulation devices at reduced cost, offering practical solutions to mitigate loss limitations in diverse material sets across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational techniques have gained significant traction in photonics, enabling the co-design of hardware and data processing algorithms to drastically simplify optical system architectures and improve their performance. However, their application in optical frequency comb spectroscopy remains considerably underexplored. In this work, we introduce a non-interferometric approach to frequency comb spectroscopy based on dynamically tailored electro-optic modulation. The core of our method is a reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of integrated optical power measurements--one per probe comb--from which the sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and improvements of the method, as well as its integration into chip-scale spectroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Design of efficient high-order immersed metagratings using an evolutionary algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersed reflection gratings improve spectral resolving power by enabling diffraction within a high refractive index medium. This principle has been widely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact. Conventional immersed gratings have blazed profiles which typically show the highest efficiency for one main design wavelength. In addition, the blazed profiles tend to cause significant polarization sensitivity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for designing an immersed grating composed of sub-wavelength structures, designed to increase diffraction efficiency and reduce polarization dependence. For a theoretical demonstration, a reflective metagrating immersed in silicon is optimized over the short-wave infrared band-3 (SWIR-3, here $2.304~\mu$m-$2.405~\mu$m), targeting the same diffraction angles as the immersion grating used in the Sentinel-5 Earth observation mission. The structure is optimized using a modified Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized immersed metagrating achieves an average efficiency of (over the SWIR-3 band) $\sim 78\%$, compared to $\sim 62\%$ for the conventional immersed blazed grating, and reduces polarization sensitivity from roughly $\sim 15\%$ to $\sim 5\%$. A manufacturing tolerance analysis is also conducted to evaluate the design's performance under systematic manufacturing errors, which revealed a degradation of $\sim 10\%$ efficiency at feature size errors of $\pm 25{nm}$ and almost negligible effect on the efficiency at $-10{nm}$ and of $\sim 5\%$ at $+10{nm}$.</description>

Abstract: High-quality micropillar cavities were grown using molecular-beam epitaxy. Stable continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature was demonstrated for microlasers with semiconductor and hybrid output mirrors. At 300 K, single-mode lasing was demonstrated for micropillars with a diameter of 5 $\mu$m at a wavelength of 960 nm, with a minimum lasing threshold of 1.2 mW and a bare quality-factor exceeding 8000.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to beat conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements. Our work is the first systematic integration of microlens design with spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays, bridging microphotonics, spintronics, and thermal imaging.</description>

      <title>Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons in Dispersive Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation -- mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion -- serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, $\Delta S_{\mathrm{tot}} \ge 0$. These results establish event horizons in dispersive field theories as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>
