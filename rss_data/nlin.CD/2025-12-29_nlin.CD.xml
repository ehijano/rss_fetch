      <title>Chaos, Ito-Stratonovich dilemma, and topological supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that the formalism of the generalized transfer operator (GTO) of dynamical systems (DS) theory, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of arbitrary form, belongs to the family of cohomological topological field theories (TFT) -- a class of models at the intersection of algebraic topology and high-energy physics. This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive "pressure", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.</description>

      <title>Existence of spectral submanifolds in time delay systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral submanifolds (SSMs) are invariant manifolds of a dynamical system, defined by the property of being tangent to a spectral subspace of the linearized dynamics at a steady state. We show existence, along with certain desirable properties such as smoothness, attractivity and conditional uniqueness, of SSMs associated to a large class of spectral subspaces in time delay systems. Building on these results, we generalize the criteria for existence of inertial manifolds -- defined as globally exponentially attracting Lipschitz invariant manifolds of finite dimension -- and show that they need not have dimension equal to that of the physical configuration, in contrast to previous accounts. We then demonstrate the applicability of these results on a few simple examples.</description>

      <title>A Lindblad-Pauli Framework for Coarse-Grained Chaotic Binary-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-graining a chaotic bistable oscillator into a binary symbol sequence is a standard reduction, but it often obscures the geometry of the reduced state space and structural constraints of physically meaningful stochastic evolution. We develop a two-state framework that embeds coarse-grained left/right statistics of the driven Duffing oscillator into a $2\times2$ density-matrix representation and models inter-well switching by a two-rate Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) generator. For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations. The density-matrix formalism is an organizational convenience rather than claiming quantum-classical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Discrete Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</description>
