      <title>Many-Body Localization and Particle Statistics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential influence of the particle statistics on the stability of the many-body localization in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent Fermi statistics.</description>

      <title>Interaction-correlated random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of random matrices where correlations between matrix elements are induced via interaction-derived Boltzmann factors. Varying these yields access to different ensembles. We find a universal scaling behavior of the finite-size statistics characterized by a heavy-tailed eigenvalue distribution whose extremes are governed by the Fr\'echet extreme value distribution for the case corresponding to a ferromagnetic Ising transition. The introduction of a finite density of nonlocal interactions restores standard random-matrix behavior. Suitably rescaled average extremes, playing a physical role as an order parameter, can thus discriminate aspects of the interaction structure; they also yield further nonuniversal information. In particular, the link between maximum eigenvalues and order parameters offers a potential route to resolving long-standing problems in statistical physics, such as deriving the exact magnetization scaling function in the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality.</description>

      <title>Estimating predictability of depinning dynamics by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Real space quantum metric of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By applying the projector to the filled lattice eigenstates on a specific position, or applying the local electron annihilation operator on the many-body ground state, one can construct a quantum state localized around a specific position in a solid. The overlap of two such local states at slightly different positions defines a quantum metric in real space, which manifests even in systems as simple as particles in a box. For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES. The presence of disorder curves the real space manifold and gives rise to various differential geometrical quantities like Riemann tensor and Ricci scalar, indicating the possibility of engineering differential geometrical properties by disorder, as demonstrated by lattice models of 2D metals and topological insulators.</description>
