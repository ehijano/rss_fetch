      <title>No arbitrage and the existence of ACLMMs in general diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, F. Delbaen and W. Schachermayer proved that the classical NA ("no arbitrage") condition implies the existence of an "absolutely continuous local martingale measure" (ACLMM). It is known that in general the existence of an ACLMM alone is not sufficient for NA. In this paper we investigate how close these notions are for single asset general diffusion market models. We show that NA is equivalent to the existence of an ACLMM plus a mild regularity condition on the scale function and the absence of reflecting boundaries. For infinite time horizon scenarios, the regularity assumption and the requirement on the boundaries can be dropped, showing equivalence between NA and the existence of an ACLMM. By means of counterexamples, we show that our characterization of NA for finite time horizons is sharp in the sense that neither the regularity condition on the scale function nor the absence of reflecting boundaries can be dropped.</description>

      <title>Backtesting Framework for Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers on Uniswap V3 Decentralized Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial landscape, with protocols like Uniswap offering innovative automated market-making mechanisms. This article explores the development of a backtesting framework specifically tailored for concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMM). The focus is on leveraging the liquidity distribution approximated using a parametric model, to estimate the rewards within liquidity pools.
  The article details the design, implementation, and insights derived from this novel approach to backtesting within the context of Uniswap V3. The developed backtester was successfully utilized to assess reward levels across several pools using historical data from 2023 (pools Uniswap v3 for pairs of altcoins, stablecoins and USDC/ETH with different fee levels). Moreover, the error in modeling the level of rewards for the period under review for each pool was less than 1\%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the backtester in quantifying liquidity pool rewards and its potential in estimating LP's revenues as part of the pool rewards, as focus of our next research.
  The backtester serves as a tool to simulate trading strategies and liquidity provision scenarios, providing a quantitative assessment of potential returns for liquidity providers (LP). By incorporating statistical tools to mirror CLMM pool liquidity dynamics, this framework can be further leveraged for strategy enhancement and risk evaluation for LPs operating within decentralized exchanges.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signature-Based Distribution Regression via Reference Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution Regression (DR) on stochastic processes describes the learning task of regression on collections of time series. Path signatures, a technique prevalent in stochastic analysis, have been used to solve the DR problem. Recent works have demonstrated the ability of such solutions to leverage the information encoded in paths via signature-based features. However, current state of the art DR solutions are memory intensive and incur a high computation cost. This leads to a trade-off between path length and the number of paths considered. This computational bottleneck limits the application to small sample sizes which consequently introduces estimation uncertainty. In this paper, we present a methodology for addressing the above issues; resolving estimation uncertainties whilst also proposing a pipeline that enables us to use DR for a wide variety of learning tasks. Integral to our approach is our novel distance approximator. This allows us to seamlessly apply our methodology across different application domains, sampling rates, and stochastic process dimensions. We show that our model performs well in applications related to estimation theory, quantitative finance, and physical sciences. We demonstrate that our model generalises well, not only to unseen data within a given distribution, but also under unseen regimes (unseen classes of stochastic models).</description>
