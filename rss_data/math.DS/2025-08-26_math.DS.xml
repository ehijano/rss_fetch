      <title>A Koopman Operator Framework for Nonlinear Epidemic Dynamics: Application to an SIRSD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze an SIRSD epidemic model, which extends the classical SIR framework by incorporating waning immunity and disease-induced mortality. A rigorous well-posedness analysis ensures the existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of solutions, guaranteeing the model's epidemiological feasibility. To facilitate theoretical investigations and data-driven modeling, we reformulated the system in normalized variables. To capture and predict complex nonlinear epidemic dynamics, we use the Koopman operator framework with extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and an epidemiologically informed dictionary of observables. We compare two Koopman approximations: one based on a minimal epidemiological dictionary and another enriched with nonlinear and cross terms. We generate synthetic data using a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme for four representative epidemics: SARS-CoV-2, seasonal influenza, Ebola, and measles. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the Koopman-based approach effectively identifies dominant epidemic modes and accurately predicts key outbreak characteristics, including peak infection dynamics.</description>

      <title>CarboNet: A Finite-Time Combustion-Tolerant Compartmental Network for Tropospheric Carbon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While governments and international organizations have set the net-zero target to prevent a climate event horizon, practical solutions are lacking mainly because of the impracticability to completely replace combustion processes. Hence, in this paper, we first design a compartmental network whose states must remain in the nonnegative orthant for physical consistency and in which the carbon dioxide emissions result from the combustion of diesel in vehicles and gas in house heaters. Then, we designed both full-state and output-feedback linear-quadratic regulators of the compartmental network to bring the mass of carbon dioxide to the pre-industrial era, which is reached in approximately 25 and 60 days, respectively. The output feedback tolerates for 6 days the combustion taking place in 5,000 vehicles and in 10,000 house heating systems, it meets the net-zero target, and it nullifies the extraction of finite natural resources. The tropospheric temperature with closed-loop reaches the equilibrium at 133 {\deg}C after 16.4 years; while such an high value requires to further investigate with climate experts the model of the dynamics of the temperature, this work is a first step in designing optimal network control systems for climate stability.

      <title>Symbolic dynamics, shadowing and representation of real numbers with some countably piecewise linear Markov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study piecewise linear Markov maps, with countable Markov partitions, inspired by a problem of the Mikl\'os Schweitzer competition of the J\'anos Bolyai Mathematical Society in 2022. We introduce $\ell$-Markov partitions and apply ideas of symbolic dynamics to our systems, relating them to Markov shifts. We prove the shadowing property for the system from the competition. We also investigate the possible orbits of rational numbers, for a class of piecewise linear Markov maps which generalize our original system. This has connections with symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximations and Cantor series. We prove statements on the eventual periodicity of rationals and provide some example systems with different properties.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Shadowing in Uniform Transformation Semigroups Modulo an Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze several key dynamical properties-namely shadowing modulo an ideal, expansivity modulo an ideal, and topological stability modulo an ideal-within the framework of uniform transformation semigroups. Given an ideal $\mathcal I$ on semigroup $T$, we investigate the interplay between these properties in compact Hausdorff transformation semigroup $(T,X,\mathfrak{X})$. Our main result establishes that if a compact Hausdorff transformation semigroup exhibits the shadowing property modulo $\mathcal I$ and is expansive modulo $\mathcal I$ then it is also topologically stable modulo $\mathcal I$. This extends known stability theorems in classical topological dynamics to the setting of ideal-constrained dynamics. Additionally, we explore the relationship between shadowing modulo $\mathcal I$ and the conventional shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Invariant Tori for Stochastic Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger in the Sense of Most Probable Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of KAM theory to the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on infinite lattices, focusing on the stability of low-dimensional invariant tori in the sense of most probable paths. For generality, we provide an abstract proof within the framework of stochastic Hamiltonian systems on infinite lattices. We begin by constructing the Onsager-Machlup functional for these systems in a weighted infinite sequence space. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation, we identify the most probable transition path of the system's trajectory under stochastic perturbations. Additionally, we establish a large deviation principle for the system and derive a rate function that quantifies the deviation of the system's trajectory from the most probable path, especially in rare events. Combining this with classical KAM theory for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we demonstrate the persistence of low-dimensional invariant tori under small deterministic and stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we prove that the probability of the system's trajectory deviating from these tori can be described by the derived rate function, providing a new probabilistic framework for understanding the stability of stochastic Hamiltonian systems on infinite lattices.</description>

      <title>Exploration of vertical self-resonant bifurcations from DRO in the Earth-Moon CR3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate vertical self-resonant (VSR) bifurcations from distant retrograde orbit (DRO) family in the framework of the Earth-Moon CR3BP. To this end, by using a classical corrector-predictor algorithm we compute the vertical stability of DROs and identify twelve vertical-critical DROs. We split them into three groups according to orbiting around libration points $L_i$, $i=1,2,4,5$. (i) We first analyze six VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to ten associated to DROs near the Moon. (ii) For DROs that move in addition around $L_1$ and $L_2$, we study four VSR bifurcations of multiplicity from five to eight. (iii) Within DROs additionally orbiting also around $L_4$ and $L_5$, two vertical 1:1 resonant branch points occur. In total, we generate 21 bifurcated families of spatial symmetric periodic solutions and present their orbital characteristics, including bridge families to Butterfly, prograde orbits, quasi DRO and DRO. We also obtain branches whose members approach collision with the Moon and are of Bumble Bee, Hoverfly or Dragonfly shape. In order to provide a structured and systematic overview of such bifurcation results, we determine Conley-Zehnder indices and construct bifurcation diagrams in view of symplectic invariants.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-like dynamics of analytic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of polynomial-like maps is of fundamental importance in holomorphic dynamics. We study dynamical properties of a larger class of maps. Our main result is that, under some natural conditions, a map of this class has a completely invariant compact set if and only if this set is the filled Julia set of a polynomial-like restriction of the map. We also generalize this result to include maps with non-connected domains of definition.</description>

      <title>Study Entropy of L-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of L-algebra is revisited and after that, the article is prepared to deal with the notion of the entropy of an L-algebra. If a set has an L-algebraic structure, it is possible to calculate the degree of uncertainty for an event called partition. Sometimes one calculate the degree of uncertainty of an event given another event, which is actually called the conditional entropy. Some propositions are given to calculate the entropy of a dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Pre-Lagrangian tori transverse to an Anosov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Anosov flow on a smooth three-manifold \( M \) gives rise to a Liouville structure on \( \mathbb{R} \times M \) by a construction of Mitsumatsu. In a recent paper, Cieliebak, Lazarev, Massoni and Moreno ask whether an embedded torus \( \Sigma \subseteq M \) transverse to an Anosov flow gives rise to a Lagrangian in \( \mathbb{R} \times M \). We show that the answer to this question is in general negative by finding a topological obstruction related to the foliations induced on the torus by the weak stable and unstable bundles of the flow. Going in the opposite direction, we show that the answer is positive if the induced foliations do not admit parallel compact leaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider spatial processes and measure dynamical systems over locally compact Abelian groups. We characterize when a spatial processes is equivalent to a translation bounded measure dynamical systems and we characterize when a spatial processes is equivalent to a positive measure dynamical systems. The basic idea of our approach is the identification of the elements of a spatial process with translation bounded measures respectively positive measures by applying the Gelfand theory of $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Variations of topological theory and ergodic theory via gap function in non-uniform specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [44], we qualitatively studied some classical results implied by the specification property for dynamical systems with non-uniform specification. In this paper, we perform quantitative studies on how properties of topological theory and ergodic theory vary with the gap function in non-uniform specification from different points of view. Firstly, we establish a lower estimation for Bowen topological entropy of irregular sets, determined by the lower asymptotic linear growth rate of the gap function. As a contrast, we prove that under the non-uniform specification property, every non-empty over-saturated set, and thus the completely-irregular set carries full packing topological entropy. We also estimate the Bowen topological entropy of transitive points and the exponential growth rate of periodic orbits. Besides, we provide a constructive mechanism for generating dynamical systems with non-uniform specification, containing an arbitrarily given subshift. This mechanism demonstrates the richness of dynamical systems with non-uniform specification by constructing systems attaining arbitrarily large values of topological entropy. Moreover, we use this mechanism to find examples demonstrating that the lower estimation for Bowen topological entropy is optimal in some cases and that the optimal upper estimation is the full topological entropy. These examples also demonstrate the optimality of the estimation of exponential growth rate and further indicate that, when the lower asymptotic linear growth rate of the gap function is larger than zero, (i) transitive points may not carry full Bowen topological entropy; (ii) the conditional variational principle and the intermediate entropy property may be destroyed. In addition, we study the variations of ergodic optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Dynamical Multi-Commodity Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of dynamical multi-commodity flow networks in transportation networks. These are modeled as dynamical systems describing the evolution of the densities of a number of different commodities across the cells of a transportation network. Each cell is characterized by commodity-specific increasing demand functions returning the maximum outflow of each commodity from the cell as a function of the current density of that commodity, as well as a decreasing supply function returning the total maximum inflow that is allowed in the cell as a function of the current aggregate density in the cell. Every commodity is characterized by a different routing matrix, whose entries describe the turning ratios between adjacent cells. We identify a (typically convex) capacity region: for exogenous inflow vectors belonging to that region, we prove the existence of a locally asymptotically stable free-flow equilibrium point. Building on a contraction argument, we also provide an estimate of the basin of attraction of such free-flow equilibrium point. Finally, we analyze a simple special case showing that, when the exogenous inflow vector does not belong to the region of stability, non-free flow equilibrium points might arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study piecewise linear Markov maps, with countable Markov partitions, inspired by a problem of the Mikl\'os Schweitzer competition in 2022. We introduce $\ell$-Markov partitions and apply ideas of symbolic dynamics to our systems, relating them to Markov shifts. We survey how the Frobenius--Perron operators of these systems can be represented by matrices, and adapt results to countable alphabets. We apply these statements to prove a convergence theorem on the pushforwards of absolutely continuous measures. This enables us to prove a variety of useful ergodic properties of our maps and study even non-$\sigma$-finite absolutely continuous invariant measures. We explain how our results are not implied by previous ones and apply the convergence theorem to solve the original problem in the competition.</description>

      <title>The influence of the maximal summand on ergodic sums of non-integrable observables over rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $R_{\alpha}$ being an irrational rotation of angle $\alpha$ on the one torus $\mathbb{T}$ and $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{1-x}$, we compare the behavior of the Birkhoff sum $S_N(\phi)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^k)(x)$ with the successive entry $(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)$. In particular, we are interested in the almost sure limsup behavior of $\frac{(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)}{S_N(\phi)(x)}$. We show that depending on the Diophantine properties of $\alpha$ we have that the limsup either equals $0$ or $\infty$. Moreover, we show that those $\alpha$ for which the limsup equals $0$ form an atypical set in the sense that its Hausdorff dimension equals $\frac{1}{2}$. These results have consequences in studying a reparametrization $(T_t)$ of the linear flow $(L_t)$ with direction $(1,\alpha)$ on the two torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ with function $\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a smooth non-negative function that has exactly two (non-degenerate) zeros at $\bf p$ and $\bf q$. We prove that for a full measure set $(\alpha, {\bf p}, {\bf q})\in \mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{T}^2$ the special flow $(T_t)$ exhibits extreme historic behavior proving a conjecture given by Andersson and Guih\'eneuf.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotics and fine-scale behavior of quantitative combinatorial measures of infinite words and related dynamical and algebraic structures.
  We construct infinite recurrent words $w$ whose complexity functions $p_w(n)$ are arbitrarily close to linear, but whose discrete derivatives are not bounded from above by $p_w(n)/n$. Moreover, we construct words of polynomially bounded complexity whose discrete derivatives exceed $p_w(n)/n^\varepsilon$ infinitely often, for every given $\varepsilon&gt;0$. These provide negative answers in a strong sense to an open question of Cassaigne from 1997, showing that his theorem on words of linear complexity is best possible.
  Next, we characterize, up to a linear multiplicative error, the complexity functions of strictly ergodic subshifts, showing that every non-decreasing, submultiplicative function arises in this setting. This gives the first `industrial' construction of strictly ergodic subshifts of prescribed subexponential complexity.
  We then investigate quantitative recurrence in uniformly recurrent words and, as an application, address a question of Bavula from 2006 related to holonomic inequalities on the spectrum of possible filter dimensions of simple associative algebras: we construct simple algebras of prescribed filter dimension in $[1,\infty)$ and essentially settling the problem entirely in the graded case. Throughout, we construct uniformly recurrent words of linear complexity and with arbitrary polynomial recurrence growth.</description>

      <title>Dimensional dependence of synchronisation in turbulence: insights from data assimilation and Lyapunov analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence, large-scale turbulent flows inevitably determine small-scale flows. Previous studies using data assimilation with the three-dimensional NS equations indicate that employing observational data resolved down to a specific length scale, $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, enables the successful reconstruction of small-scale flows. Such a length scale of `essential resolution of observation' for reconstruction $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$ is close to the dissipation scale in three-dimensional NS turbulence. Here we study the equivalent length scale in two-dimensional NS turbulence, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$, and compare with the three-dimensional case. Our numerical studies using data assimilation and conditional Lyapunov exponents reveal that, for Kolmogorov flows with Ekman drag, the length scale $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ is actually close to the forcing scale, substantially larger than the dissipation scale. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the significant relative difference between the length scales, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ and $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, based on inter-scale interactions and orbital instabilities in turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>On a family of pseudo-Anosov-like maps on the infinite ladder surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be the closed surface of genus $g$, $\mathcal{L}$ be the infinite Jacob's ladder surface, and $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ denote the mapping class group of a surface $S$. Let $q_g:\mathcal{L}\to S_g$ be the regular infinite-sheeted cover with deck transformation group $\mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we show the existence of ``pseudo-Anosov-like'' maps on $\mathcal{L}$ that arise as the lifts of Penner-type pseudo-Anosov maps on $S_g$ under the cover $q_g$. Furthermore, we establish that these lifts are topologically transitive, mixing, and support null recurrent dynamics. Moreover, we present concrete examples of infinite families of such maps on $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>A Consensus Algorithm for Second-Order Systems Evolving on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a consensus algorithm is proposed for interacting multi-agents, which can be modeled as simple Mechanical Control Systems (MCS) evolving on a general Lie group. The standard Laplacian flow consensus algorithm for double integrator systems evolving on Euclidean spaces is extended to a general Lie group. A tracking error function is defined on a general smooth manifold for measuring the error between the configurations of two interacting agents. The stability of the desired consensus equilibrium is proved using a generalized version of Lyapunov theory and LaSalle's invariance principle applicable for systems evolving on a smooth manifold. The proposed consensus control input requires only the configuration information of the neighboring agents and does not require their velocities and inertia tensors. The design of tracking error function and consensus control inputs are demonstrated through an application of attitude consensus problem for multiple communicating rigid bodies. The consensus algorithm is numerically validated by demonstrating the attitude consensus problem.</description>

      <title>Strong averaging principle for nonautonomous multi-scale SPDEs with fully local monotone and almost periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of nonautonomous multi-scale stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients. By introducing the evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous Markov semigroups, we study the averaging principle for such kind of system. Specifically, we first prove the slow component in the multi-scale stochastic system converges strongly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients retain the dependence of the scaling parameter. Furthermore, if the coefficients satisfy uniformly almost periodic conditions, we establish that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of another averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. The main contribution of this paper extends the basic nonautonomous framework investigated by Cheng and Liu in [11] to a fully coupled framework, as well as the autonomous framework explored by Liu et al. in [27] to the more general nonautonomous framework. Additionally, we improve the locally monotone coefficients discussed in [11,27] to the fully local monotone coefficients, thus our results can be applied to a wide range of cases in nonlinear nonautonomous stochastic partial differential equations, such as multi-scale stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-heat equation and multi-scale stochastic liquid-crystal-porous-media equation.</description>

Abstract: We present the first rates of convergence to an $N$-dimensional Brownian motion when $N\ge2$ for discrete and continuous time dynamical systems. Additionally, we provide the first rates for continuous time in any dimension. Our results hold for nonuniformly hyperbolic and expanding systems, such as Axiom A flows, suspensions over a Young tower with exponential tails, and some classes of intermittent solenoids.</description>

      <title>On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We show that the approximate ODEs can be used to assess the stability of the steady states of the original DDEs and that the solution to the ODEs converges if the kernel is also exponentially bounded. Additionally, we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

Abstract: The top of the attractor $A$ of a hyperbolic iterated function system $\left\{ f_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}|i=1,2,\dots,M\right\} $ is defined and used to extend self-similar tilings to overlapping systems. The theory provides sequences of approximate supertiles that converge to tilings. Individual tiles in a tiling are limits of nested decreasing sequences of approximate tiles. Examples include systems of finite type, tilings related to aperiodic monotiles, and ones where there are infinitely many distinct but related prototiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider finitely many maps, all of which are defined on a smooth compact measure space, with at least one map in the collection having degree strictly bigger than 1. Working with random dynamics generated by this setting, we obtain an expression for the extremal Lyapunov exponents, that characterise the instability of typical orbits, as the limit of the averages of the logarithm of the operator norm of linear cocycles of generic orbits. We obtain this as a consequence to the Kingman's ergodic theorem for a subadditive sequence of measurable functions, which naturally generalises the Birkhoff's ergodic theorem.</description>

Abstract: We establish multiple recurrence results for pretentious measure-preserving multiplicative actions along generalized Pythagorean triples, that is, solutions to the equation $ax^2 + b y^2 = c z^2$. This confirms the ergodic-theoretic form of the generalized Pythagorean partition regularity conjecture in this critical case of structured measure-preserving actions. As a consequence of our main theorem, any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ generated by the level sets of finitely many pretentious completely multiplicative functions, must contain a monochromatic generalized Pythagorean triple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$.
  What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles), for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures should follow from the Standard conjectures.
  All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.03423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let f be a zero entropy automorphism of a compact K\"ahler manifold X. We study the polynomial log-volume growth Plov(f) of f in light of the dynamical filtrations introduced in our previous work with T.-C. Dinh. We obtain new upper bounds and lower bounds of Plov(f). As a corollary, we completely determine Plov(f) when dim X = 3, extending a result of Artin--Van den Bergh for surfaces. When X is projective, Plov(f) + 1 coincides with the Gelfand--Kirillov dimensions GKdim(X,f) of the twisted homogeneous coordinate rings associated to (X,f). Reformulating these results for GKdim(X,f), we improve Keeler's bounds of GKdim(X,f) and provide effective upper bounds of GKdim(X,f) which only depend on dim X.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. We study subgroups $G \le \mathrm{Aut}(X)$ of biholomorphic automorphisms of zero entropy when $\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is compact (e.g. when $\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is trivial). We show that the virtual derived length $\ell_{\mathrm{vir}}(G)$ of $G$ satisfies $\ell_{\mathrm{vir}}(G) \le \dim X -\kappa(X)$, where $\kappa(X)$ is the Kodaira dimension of $X$. Modulo the main conjecture of our previous work concerning the essential nilpotency class, we obtain the same upper bound $c_{\mathrm{vir}}(G) \le \dim X -\kappa(X)$ for the virtual nilpotency class $c_{\mathrm{vir}}(G)$, together with a geometric description of the $G$-action on $X$ when the equality holds.</description>

      <title>SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in complex environments, such as stabilizing a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force on an object in a fluid flow. However, DRL requires an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and flow control problems, including gust mitigation on a 3D NACA 0012 airfoil at $Re=1000$. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to modern DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a DRL policy.</description>

Abstract: We show that real semi-simple Lie groups of higher rank contain (infinitely generated) discrete subgroups with full limit sets in the corresponding Furstenberg boundaries. Additionally, we provide criteria under which discrete subgroups of $G = \operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ must have a full limit set in the Furstenberg boundary of $G$.
  In the appendix, we show the the existence of Zariski-dense discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $n\ge 3$, such that the Jordan projection of some loxodromic element $\gamma \in\Gamma$ lies on the boundary of the limit cone of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in class of a large-dimensional neural networks posed on random graphs and subject to spatio-temporal stochastic forcing. Under generic conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network admits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field equation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance of neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are tractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the diffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find conditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is modelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral waves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence that solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the mean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides a means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations induced by finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>On multiplicative recurrence along linear patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence for actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and provided some sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition for $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely multiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully characterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter property. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning the pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun. In addition, we prove that, under the same conditions on $(a,b,c,d)$, the set $S$ is a set of recurrence for finitely generated actions of $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$.</description>

      <title>Dimensions and metric dyadic cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide equivalent definitions for fractal geometric dimensions through dyadic cube constructions. Given a metric space $X$ with finite Assouad dimension, i.e., satisfying the doubling property, we show that the construction of systems of dyadic cubes by Hyt\"onen-Kairema is compatible with many dimensions. In particular, the Hausdorff, Minkowski, and Assouad dimensions can be equivalently expressed solely using dyadic cubes in the aforementioned system. The same is true for the Assouad spectrum, a collection of dimensions introduced by Fraser-Yu.</description>

      <title>Morse-Bott Volume Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Morse-Bott volume form on a manifold is a top-degree form which vanishes along a non-degenerate critical submanifold. We prove that two such forms are diffeomorphic (by a diffeomorphism fixed on the submanifold) provided that their relative cohomology classes with respect to the submanifold coincide. For a zero submanifold of codimension at least 2, this means that two Morse-Bott volume forms with the same zero set are diffeomorphic if and only if they have equal total volumes. We show how "Moser's trick" for establishing equivalence of non-degenerate volume forms can be adapted to this setting.</description>

      <title>Time-Scale Coupling Between States and Parameters in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control information flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam. Empirical simulations corroborate these claims: in several sequence tasks, we show that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding the anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not equivalent mechanisms. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.</description>

      <title>Barnsley-Navascu\'es fractal operators on Banach spaces on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we define fractal operators motivated by the works of Barnsley and Navascu\'es on various function spaces such as energy space, Lebesgue space, and oscillation space on the well-known fractal domain Sierpi\'nski gasket. We further explore the properties of these operators from the perspectives of operator and approximation theory.</description>
