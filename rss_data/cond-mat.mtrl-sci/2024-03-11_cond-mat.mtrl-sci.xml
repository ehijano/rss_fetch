      <title>Simulating Charged Defects at Database Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects have a strong influence on the physical properties of materials, often dominating the electronic and optical behavior in semiconductors and insulators. The simulation and analysis of point defects is therefore crucial for understanding the growth and operation of materials especially for optoelectronics applications. In this work, we present a general-purpose Python framework for the analysis of point defects in crystalline materials, as well as a generalized workflow for their treatment with high-throughput simulations. The distinguishing feature of our approach is an emphasis on a unique, unitcell, structure-only, definition of point defects which decouples the defect definition and the specific supercell representation used to simulate the defect. This allows the results of first-principles calculations to be aggregated into a database without extensive provenance information and is a crucial step in building a persistent database of point defects that can grow over time, a key component towards realizing the idea of a ``defect genome' that can yield more complex relationships governing the behavior of defects in materials. We demonstrate several examples of the approach for three technologically relevant materials and highlight current pitfalls that must be considered when employing these methodologies, as well as their potential solutions.</description>

      <title>From electrons to phase diagrams with classical and machine learning potentials: automated workflows for materials science with pyiron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and user-friendly framework built upon the pyiron integrated development environment (IDE), enabling researchers to perform the entire Machine Learning Potential (MLP) development cycle consisting of (i) creating systematic DFT databases, (ii) fitting the Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to empirical potentials or MLPs, and (iii) validating the potentials in a largely automatic approach. The power and performance of this framework are demonstrated for three conceptually very different classes of interatomic potentials: an empirical potential (embedded atom method - EAM), neural networks (high-dimensional neural network potentials - HDNNP) and expansions in basis sets (atomic cluster expansion - ACE). As an advanced example for validation and application, we show the computation of a binary composition-temperature phase diagram for Al-Li, a technologically important lightweight alloy system with applications in the aerospace industry.</description>

      <title>Systematic assessment of various universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to perform simulations of \abinitio quality over very large time and length scales. More recently, various universal machine-learning models have been proposed as an out-of-box approach avoiding the need to train and validate specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we review and evaluate five different universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of density-functional-theory implementations and from the Materials Project. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems, offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine-learning methodologies in materials science.</description>

      <title>Switching intrinsic magnetic skyrmions with controllable magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically nontrivial whirling spin textures at nanometer scales, have emerged as potential information carriers for spintronic devices. The ability to efficiently create and erase magnetic skyrmions is vital yet challenging for such applications. Based on first-principles studies, we find that switching between intrinsic magnetic skyrmion and high-temperature ferromagnetic states can be achieved in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) multiferroic heterostructure CrSeI/In2Te3 by reversing the ferroelectric polarization of In2Te3. The core mechanism of this switching is traced to the controllable magnetic anisotropy of CrSeI influenced by the ferroelectric polarization of In2Te3. We propose a useful descriptor linking the presence of magnetic skyrmions to magnetic parameters, and validate this connection through studies of a variety of similar vdW multiferroic heterostructures. Our work demonstrates that manipulating magnetic skyrmions via tunable magnetic anisotropies in vdW multiferroic heterostructures represents a highly promising and energy-efficient strategy for future development of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Molten flux growth of single crystals of quasi-1D hexagonal chalcogenide BaTiS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaTiS3, a quasi-1D complex chalcogenide, has gathered considerable scientific and technological interest due to its giant optical anisotropy and electronic phase transitions. However, the synthesis of high-quality BaTiS3 crystals, particularly those featuring crystal sizes of millimeters or larger, remains a challenge. Here, we investigate the growth of BaTiS3 crystals utilizing a molten salt flux of either potassium iodide, or a mixture of barium chloride and barium iodide. The crystals obtained through this method exhibit a substantial increase in volume compared to those synthesized via the chemical vapor transport method, while preserving their intrinsic optical and electronic properties. Our flux growth method provides a promising route towards the production of high-quality, large-scale single crystals of BaTiS3, which will greatly facilitate advanced characterizations of BaTiS3 and its practical applications that require large crystal dimensions. Additionally, our approach offers an alternative synthetic route for other emerging complex chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Sensing Vibrations using Quantum Geometry of Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field emerging from the geometric curvature of quantum structure of electrons in a crystal bends electronic trajectory causing anomalous linear and nonlinear electrical Hall effects that have been observed in low symmetry crystals with narrow electronic band gap. We present first-principles theoretical analysis to show that dynamical lowering of crystal symmetry by lattice vibrations results in oscillations in the quantum geometry of electrons which have observable nonlinear Hall signatures. Using these, we introduce a vibrational spectroscopy based on Geometry of Quantum Electronic Structure (GQuES) making specific predictions for the transport and radiative GQuES spectra of 2D materials. As the crystal symmetry is commonly lowered by dynamical fields, GQuES is applicable to a wide range of materials and excitations spanning sub-GHz, THz and infrared frequencies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced performance of MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ field-effect transistors by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable methods for improving the performance and stability of a field-effect transistor (FET) based on two-dimensional materials are crucial for its real applications. A scalable method of encapsulating the exfoliated MoS$ _{2} $ on SiO$ _{2} $/Si substrate by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) is explored here for reducing the influence of interface traps and ambient contaminants. This leads to twenty-five times reduction in trap density, three times decrease in subthreshold swing, three times increase in the peak field-effect mobility and a drastic reduction in hysteresis. This performance remains nearly the same after several weeks of ambient exposure of the device. This is attributed to the superhydrophobic nature of HMDS and the SiO$_2$ surface hydrophobization by the formation of covalent bonds between the methyl groups of HMDS and silanol groups of SiO$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Free-standing cubic gauche nitrogen stable at 760 K under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) has received wide attention due to its high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, existing synthesis methods for cg-N predominantly rely on the high-pressure techniques, or the utilization of nanoconfined effects using highly toxic and sensitive sodium azide as precursor, which significantly restrict the practical application of cg-N as high energy density materials (HDEM). Here, based on the first-principles simulations, we find that the adsorption of potassium on the cg-N surface exhibits superior stabilization compared to sodium. Then, we chose the safer potassium azide as raw material for synthesizing cg-N. Through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition treatment, the free-standing cg-N was successfully synthesized without the need of high-pressure and nanoconfined effects. Importantly, it demonstrates excellent thermal stability up to 760 K, and then a rapid and intense thermal decomposition occurs, exhibiting typical behaviors of HDEM thermal decomposition. Our work has significantly promoted the practical application of cg-N as HDEM.</description>

      <title>X-ray and molecular dynamics study of the temperature-dependent structure of molten NaF-ZrF4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local atomic structure of NaF-ZrF$_4$ (53-47 mol%) molten system and its evolution with temperature are examined with x-ray scattering measurements and compared with $ab-initio$ and Neural Network-based molecular dynamics (NNMD) simulations in the temperature range 515-700 {\deg}C. The machine-learning enhanced NNMD calculations offer improved efficiency while maintaining accuracy at higher distances compared to ab-initio calculations. Looking at the evolution of the Pair Distribution Function with increasing temperature, a fundamental change in the liquid structure within the selected temperature range, accompanied by a slight decrease in overall correlation is revealed. NNMD calculations indicate the co-existence of three different fluorozirconate complexes: [ZrF$_6$]$^{2-}$, [ZrF$_7$]$^{3-}$, and [ZrF$_8$]$^{4-}$, with a temperature-dependent shift in the dominant coordination state towards a 6-coordinated Zr ion at 700{\deg}C. The study also highlights the metastability of different coordination structures, with frequent interconversions between 6 and 7 coordinate states for the fluorozirconate complex from 525 {\deg}C to 700 {\deg}C. Analysis of the Zr-F-Zr angular distribution function reveals the presence of both $"$edge-sharing$"$ and $"$corner-sharing$"$ fluorozirconate complexes with specific bond angles and distances in accord with previous studies, while the next-nearest neighbor cation-cation correlations demonstrate a clear preference for unlike cations as nearest-neighbor pairs, emphasizing non-random arrangement. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the complex local structure of the molten salt, providing insights into temperature-dependent preferences and correlations within the molten system.</description>

      <title>van Hove Singularity-Driven Emergence of Multiple Flat Bands in Kagome Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb and Cs) continue to bring surprises in generating unusual phenomena and physical properties, including anomalous Hall effect, unconventional charge density wave, electronic nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Here we report an unexpected emergence of multiple flat bands in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors. By performing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements, we observed four branches of flat bands that span over the entire momentum space. The appearance of the flat bands is not anticipated from the band structure calculations and cannot be accounted for by the known mechanisms of flat band generation. It is intimately related to the evolution of van Hove singularities. It is for the first time to observe such emergence of multiple flat bands in solid materials. Our findings provide new insights in revealing the underlying mechanism that governs the unusual behaviors in the Kagome superconductors. They also provide a new pathway in producing flat bands and set a platform to study the flat bands related physics.</description>

      <title>The Defects Genome of 2D Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from their unique two-faced structure, broken-mirror symmetry, and consequent colossal polarisation field within the monolayer. While efforts have been made to achieve high-quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain-boundary and point defects with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic properties Through High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point defects are single (Vs and Vse) and double chalcogen vacancy (Vs-Vse), interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic studies on h-BN-encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality and device properties.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-order topology with tunable chiral hinge modes and unpinned Dirac surface states in the altermagnetic insulator Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of magnetic topological states is instrumental in exploring axion electrodynamics and intriguing transport phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here, we predict that the recently-synthesized material Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$ exhibits as both an axion insulator and a 3D Stiefel-Whitney insulator with an altermagnetic order. When spins align in the $ab$ plane, we find an unpinned surface Dirac cone on the $ab$ plane and chiral hinge states along the $c$ direction, where hinge states can generate a half-quantized surface anomalous Hall effect on the $ac$ and $bc$ facets. When spins align along $c$, we observe a mirror-protected topological crystalline insulator. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic phase, in which spins are aligned in the same direction by an external in-plane magnetic field, presents an ideal Weyl semimetal with a single pair of type-I Weyl points and no extra Fermi pocket. Our work predicts rich topological states tuned by magnetic structures in Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$, supporting the further study of the topological transport and Majorana fermions in proximity to a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Preparation of Epitaxial Scandium Trifluoride Thin Films using Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk Scandium trifluoride ($\mathrm{ScF_3}$) is known for a pronounced negative thermal expansion (NTE) over a wide range of temperature, from $10~\mathrm{K}~\text{to}~ 1100~\mathrm{K}$. The structure of $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ can be described as an $\mathrm{ABX_3}$ perovskite with an empty A-site and a space group of Pm-3m. Growing thin films of $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ allows for tuning the lattice constant, the thermal expansion, and the construction of devices based upon differential thermal expansion. We have investigated the growth of $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ films on oxide and fluoride substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) This letter describes the successful growth recipe for producing high quality epitaxial $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ thin films on positive thermal expansion (PTE) lithium fluoride ($\mathrm{LiF}$) substrates, at substrate temperature, $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with a laser repetition rate of $1~\mathrm{Hz}$, with an energy per pulse of $600~\mathrm{mJ}$, under a vacuum of $1.5\times 10^{-6}~ \mathrm{torr}$, for a growth time of $6$ hours. However, even for films with excellent epitaxy and sharp peaks along the principal axes, diffraction peaks from certain crystallographic directions are extremely broad, with the example of ($104$) reflections, in this work. We attribute this broadening to disorder in the $\mathrm{F_6}$ octahedral rotations that occur as an attempt to accommodate the large temperature-induced lattice mismatch that results in cooling from the growth temperature for this system of a NTE film mated to a PTE substrate.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Rapid Targeted Synthesis of Compositionally Complex Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of advanced materials is tending toward increasingly complex compositions. Synthesizing precise composition is time-consuming and becomes exponentially demanding with increasing compositional complexity. An experienced human operator does significantly better than a beginner but still struggles to consistently achieve precision when synthesis parameters are coupled. The time to optimize synthesis becomes a barrier to exploring scientifically and technologically exciting compositionally complex materials. This investigation demonstrates an Active Learning (AL) approach for optimizing physical vapor deposition synthesis of thin-film alloys with up to five principal elements. We compared AL based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Random Forest (RF) models. The best performing models were able to discover synthesis parameters for a target quinary alloy in 14 iterations. We also demonstrate the capability of these models to be used in transfer learning tasks. RF and GP models trained on lower dimensional systems (i.e. ternary, quarternary) show an immediate improvement in prediction accuracy compared to models trained only on quinary samples. Furthermore, samples that only share a few elements in common with the target composition can be used for model pre-training. We believe that such AL approaches can be widely adapted to significantly accelerate the exploration of compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>Electrical Degradation in Dielectric and Piezoelectric Oxides: Review of Defect Chemistry and Associated Characterization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of dielectric and piezoelectric oxides are determined by their processing history, crystal structure, chemical composition, microstructure, dopants (or defect) distribution, and defect kinetics. These materials are essential in a diverse range of applications including aerospace, medical, military, transportation, power engineering, and communication, where they are used as ceramic discs, thick and thin films, multilayer devices, etc. Significant advances in understanding the materials, processing, properties, and reliability of these materials have led to their widespread use in consumer electronics, military, and aerospace applications. This review delves into electrical degradation in dielectrics and piezoelectrics, focusing on defect chemistry and key characterization techniques. It also provides a detailed discussion of various spectroscopic, microscopic, and electronic characterization techniques essential for analyzing defects and degradation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>First-principles Study of Carrier Mobility in MX (M=Sn, Pb; X=P, As) Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds from groups IV and V have been the focus of recent research due to their impressive physical characteristics and structural stability. In this study, the MX monolayers (M=Sn, Pb; N=P, As) are investigated with first-principles calculations based on Boltzmann transport theory. The results show that SnP, SnAs, and PbAs all exhibit indirect band gaps, whereas PbP is the only semiconductor with a direct band gap. One important finding is that intravalley scattering has a significant impact on electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, changes in carrier concentration do not affect the electron mobility within these MX monolayers, with SnP exhibiting the highest electron mobility among them. Subsequently, the SnP under a 6% biaxial strain is further explored and the results demonstrated a considerable increase in electron mobility to 2,511.9 cm^2/Vs, which is attributable to decreased scattering. This suggests that MX monolayers, especially SnP, are promising options for 2D semiconductor materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Suppression of flux jumps in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors by ferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux jumps observed in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors are urgent problems to construct high field superconducting magnets. The low-field instabilities usually reduce the current-carrying capability and thus cause the premature quench of Nb$_3$Sn coils at low magnetic field. In this paper, we explore suppressing the flux jumps by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Firstly, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to a magnetic field loop with constant sweeping rate. Comparing with bare Nb$_3$Sn and Nb$_3$Sn/Cu wires, we reveal two underlying mechanisms that the suppression of flux jumps is mainly attributed to the thermal effect of FM layer for the case of lower sweeping rate, whereas both thermal and electromagnetic effects play a crucial role for the case of higher sweeping rate. Furthermore, we explore the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to AC magnetic fields with amplitude $B_{a0}$ and frequency $\rm\omega$. We build up the phase diagrams of flux jumps in the plane $\rm\omega$-$B_{a0}$ for bare Nb$_{3}$Sn wire, Nb$_{3}$Sn/Cu wire and Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire, respectively. We stress that the region of flux jumps of Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire is much smaller than the other two wires, which indicates that the Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire has significant advantage over merely increasing the heat capacity. The findings shed light on suppression of the flux jumps by utilizing FM materials, which is useful for developing new type of high-$J_c$ Nb$_{3}$Sn conductors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of sliding ferroelectricity and dynamical magnetic field in van der Waals bilayer induced by light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is a unique type of polarity recently observed in a properly stacked van der Waals bilayer. However, electric-field control of sliding ferroelectricity is hard and could induce large coercive electric fields and serious leakage currents which corrode the ferroelectricity and electronic properties, which are essential for modern two-dimensional electronics and optoelectronics. Here, we proposed laser-pulse deterministic control of sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer h-BN by first principles and molecular dynamics simulation with machine-learned force fields. The laser pulses excite shear modes which exhibit certain directional movements of lateral sliding between bilayers. The vibration of excited modes under laser pulses is predicted to overcome the energy barrier and achieve the switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Furthermore, it is found that three possible sliding transitions - between AB (BA) and BA (AB) stacking - can lead to the occurrence of dynamical magnetic fields along three different directions. Remarkably, the magnetic fields are generated by the simple linear motion of nonmagnetic species, without any need for more exotic (circular, spiral) pathways. Such predictions of deterministic control of sliding ferroelectricity and multi-states of dynamical magnetic field thus expand the potential applications of sliding ferroelectricity in memory and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Handedness manipulation of propagating antiferromagnetic magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic magnons possess a distinctive feature absent in their ferromagnetic counterparts: the presence of two distinct handedness modes, the right-handed (RH) and left-handed (LH) precession modes. The magnon handedness determines the sign of spin polarization carried by the propagating magnon, which is indispensable for harnessing the diverse functionalities. However, the control of coherently propagating magnon handedness in antiferromagnets has remained elusive so far. Here we demonstrate the manipulation and electrical readout of propagating magnon handedness in perpendicularly magnetized synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF). We find that the antiferromagnetic magnon handedness can be directly identified by measuring the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) voltage, which arises from the spin pumping effect caused by the propagating antiferromagnetic magnons in the SAF structure. The RH and LH modes of the magnon can be distinguishable particularly when the SAF structure is sandwiched by heavy metals with the same sign of spin Hall angle. Moreover, we succeed in controlling the handedness of propagating antiferromagnetic magnons by tuning the excitation microwave frequency. This work unveils promising avenues for harnessing magnon unique properties in antiferromagnet-based magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Bulk and interface spin-orbit torques in Pt/Co/MgO thin film structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in archetypical Pt/Co/MgO thin films structures by performing harmonic Hall measurements. The behaviour of the damping like (DL) effective field ($h_{DL}$) with varying the Pt layer thickness and the Co layer thickness indicates that bulk spin-Hall effect (SHE) in Pt is mainly responsible for DL-SOT. The insertion of a Pd ultrathin layer at the Pt/Co interface leads to a step decrease in $h_{DL}$, attributed to the modification of interfacial spin transparency. Further increase in Pd thickness led to a reduction of the interfacial spin-orbit coupling (iSOC) quantified by the decrease in the surface magnetic anisotropy. The consistent insensitivity of $h_{DL}$ to variations in iSOC at the bottom Pt/Co interface and oxidation at the top Co/MgO interface provides additional evidence for the bulk SHE origin of DL-SOT. The strong reduction in the field-like (FL) torque effective field ($h_{FL}$) with decreasing iSOC at the Pt/Co interface points to the interfacial nature of FL-SOT, either due to iSOC induced interfacial spin-currents or to the Rashba-Edelstein effect at the Pt/Co interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a FL-SOT develops at the top Co/MgO interface opposing the one generated at the bottom Pt/Co interface, whose strength increases with Co/MgO interfacial oxidation, and attributed to the Rashba-Edelstein effect.</description>

      <title>Influence of Li-stoichiometry on electrical and acoustic properties and temperature stability of Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$ solid solutions up to 900 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work is focused on the impact of the lithium stoichiometry on electrical conductivity, acoustic properties and high-temperature stability of single crystalline Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$ at high temperatures. The crystals grown from Li-deficient melts were treated by the vapor transport equilibration (VTE) method, achieving near stoichiometric Li-content. It is shown, that the VTE-treated specimens generally exhibit lower conductivity at temperatures below 800 {\deg}C, which is attributed to the reduced number of Li-vacancies in near stoichiometric Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$, provided that the Li-ion migration dominates the conductivity in this temperature range. Further, it is shown, that above 600-650 {\deg}C different mechanism increasingly contributes to the conductivity, which is consequently attributed to the electronic conduction. Further, it is shown that losses in LNT strongly increase above about 500 {\deg}C, which is interpreted to originate from conductivity-related relaxation mechanism. Finally, the thermal stability of Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$ is evaluated by the measurement of the conductivity and resonance frequency as a function of time. It is found that during annealing at 700 {\deg}C for 350 hours, the resonance frequency of LiNbO$_{3}$ remains in a {\textpm} 100 ppm range of the initial value of 3.5 MHz.</description>

      <title>Structure and dielectric properties of BFN-KN solid solutions synthesized through solution combustion route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solution combustion reaction (SCR) route is suitable for the synthesis of phase pure (x)BaFe0.5Nb0.5O3-(1-x)KNbO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) (BFN-KN) solid solutions due to atomic level of mixing of precursors than that of the solid-state reaction (SSR) route. A variation in composition 'x' of our double perovskite samples leads to a gradual variation in the structural disorder associated with the disorder in the distribution in the cationic positions, the lattice strain, and the defects at the grain boundaries. With the increase in the BFN content in the solid solutions, a decrease in bandgap and a corresponding change in the color of the samples are observed. Furthermore, three distinct characteristic features in the frequency-dependent polarization behavior in our samples are observed at different frequencies. These features observed to be sustaining up to gradually increasing frequencies are assigned to (1) the interfacial polarization originating due to the structural disorder present at the grain boundaries, (2) the cationic positions leading to tilting/expansion of oxygen octahedra, and (3) the ionic size mismatch leading to strain distribution. The results are well supported by the results obtained for the microstructural, structural, and optical properties of our samples. Hence, our work provides a better understanding of the dielectric polarization behavior of double perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.</description>

      <title>Accurate Crystal Structure Prediction of New 2D Hybrid Organic Inorganic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks. This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs. Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and inorganic layers.</description>

Abstract: Solar energy is rapidly becoming a robust renewable energy source to conventional finite resources such as fossil fuels. It is harvested using interconnected photovoltaic panels, typically built with crystalline silicon cells, i.e. semiconducting materials that convert effectively the solar radiation into electricity. However, crystalline silicon is fragile and vulnerable to cracking over time or in predictive maintenance tasks, which can lead to electric isolation of parts of the solar cell and even failure, thus affecting the panel performance and reducing electricity generation. This work aims to developing a system for detecting cell cracks in solar panels to anticipate and alaert of a potential failure of the photovoltaic system by using computer vision techniques. Three scenarios are defined where these techniques will bring value. In scenario A, images are taken manually and the system detecting failures in the solar cells is not subject to any computationa constraints. In scenario B, an Edge device is placed near the solar farm, able to make inferences. Finally, in scenario C, a small microcontroller is placed in a drone flying over the solar farm and making inferences about the solar cells' states. Three different architectures are found the most suitable solutions, one for each scenario, namely the InceptionV3 model, an EfficientNetB0 model shrunk into full integer quantization, and a customized CNN architechture built with VGG16 blocks.</description>

Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat into electricity or act as solid-state Peltier coolers, are emerging as key technologies to address global energy shortages and environmental sustainability. However, discovering materials with high thermoelectric conversion efficiency is a complex and slow process. The emerging field of high-throughput material discovery demonstrates its potential to accelerate the development of new thermoelectric materials combining high efficiency and low cost. The synergistic integration of high-throughput material processing and characterization techniques with machine learning algorithms can form an efficient closed-loop process to generate and analyze broad data sets to discover new thermoelectric materials with unprecedented performances. Meanwhile, the recent development of advanced manufacturing methods provides exciting opportunities to realize scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient fabrication of thermoelectric devices. This review provides an overview of recent advances in discovering thermoelectric materials using high-throughput methods, including processing, characterization, and screening. Advanced manufacturing methods of thermoelectric devices are also introduced to realize the broad impacts of thermoelectric materials in power generation and solid-state cooling. In the end, this paper also discusses the future research prospects and directions.</description>

      <title>On the importance of experimental details: A Comment on "Non-Polaritonic Effects in Cavity-Modified Photochemistry"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an article by the Barnes group reported on the experimental study of a photoisomerization reaction inside an optical cavity, claiming to reproduce previous results by Hutchison et al. and making the point that in such setups, changes in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the molecules in the cavity can lead to modifications in the photochemical reaction rate. While Hutchison et al. associated such modifications with the emergence of strong light-matter coupling, in their attempt to re-examine these experiments, Barnes et al. did not find any evidence that strong coupling needs to be invoked to explain the observed effects. In response to this publication, we herein highlight the main differences between the two experimental studies, and explain why the results of Barnes et al. are irrelevant to the former study and have no bearing on its conclusions. Specifically, we show that under the experimental conditions used by Hutchison et al. such intensity-modification effects are negligible and can therefore be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Novel quantum spin liquid ground state in the trimer rhodate Ba$_4$NbRh$_3$O$_{12}$</title>

Abstract: Frustrated magnets offer a plethora of exotic magnetic ground states, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs), in which enhanced quantum fluctuations prevent a long-range magnetic ordering of the strongly correlated spins down to lowest temperature. Here we have investigated the trimer based mixed valence hexagonal rhodate Ba$_4$NbRh$_3$O$_{12}$ using a combination of dc and ac magnetization, electrical resistivity, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Despite the substantial antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, as evident from the Weiss temperature ($\theta_{\mathrm{W}}\sim -35$ to -45 K), among the Rh-local moments, neither long-range magnetic ordering nor spin-freezing is observed down to at least 50 mK, in ac-susceptibility, specific heat and ZF-$\mu$SR measurements (down to 0.26 K). We ascribe the absence of any magnetic transition to enhanced quantum fluctuations as a result of geometrical frustration arising out of the edge-sharing equilateral Rh-triangular network in the structure. Our longitudinal-field $\mu$SR result evidences persistent spin fluctuations down to 0.26~K, thus stabilizing a dynamic QSL ground state in Ba$_4$NbRh$_3$O$_{12}$. Furthermore, the magnetic specific heat ($C_{\mathrm{m}}$) data at low-$T$ reveal a significant $T$-linear contribution plus a quadratic $T$-dependence. A $T$-linear behavior is evocative of gapless spin excitations, while the $T^2$-term of $C_{\mathrm{m}}$ may indicate the Dirac QSL phenomenology of the spinon excitations with a linear dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of electronic correlation effect [M. Corasaniti \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, L121112 (2021)] and topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band topology in this family of Kondo Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous probes for BCDI: Toward the imaging of dynamic and distorted crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an innovative approach to improve Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) microscopy applied to time evolving crystals and/or non-homogeneous crystalline strain fields, identified as two major limitations of BCDI microscopy. Speckle BCDI (spBCDI), introduced here, rests on the ability of a strongly non-uniform illumination to induce a convolution of the three-dimensional (3D) frequency content associated with the finite-size crystal and a kernel acting perpendicularly to the illumination beam. In the framework of Bragg diffraction geometry, this convolution is beneficial as it encodes some 3D information about the sample in a single two-dimensional (2D) measurement, i.e., in the detector plane. With this approach, we demonstrate that we can drastically reduce the sampling frequency along the rocking curve direction and still obtain data sets with enough information to be inverted by a traditional phase retrieval algorithm.
  Numerical simulations, performed for a highly distorted crystal, show that spBCDI allows a gain in the sampling ratio ranging between 4 and 20 along the rocking curve scan, for a speckle illumination with individual speckle size of 50 nm. Furthermore, spBCDI allows working at low intensity levels, leading to an additional gain for the total scanning time. Reductions of a factor of about 32 were numerically observed. Thus, measurements in the 0.3 s time scale at 4th generation synchrotrons become feasible, with a remarkable performance for the imaging of strongly distorted crystals. Practical details on the implementation of the method are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally non-equilibrium transport in unipolar quasi-1D hot electron devices reaching ballistic limit. The devices are realized with heterostructure engineering in nanowires to obtain dopant- and dislocation-free 1D-epitaxy and flexible bandgap engineering. We show experimentally the control of hot electron injection with a graded conduction band profile and subsequent filtering of hot and relaxed electrons with rectangular energy barriers. The number of electron passing the barrier depends exponentially on the transport length with a mean free path of 200 - 260 nm and reaches ballistic transport regime for the shortest devices with 70 % of the electrons flying freely through the base electrode and the barrier reflections limiting the transport to the collector.</description>

      <title>Validation of the GreenX library time-frequency component for efficient GW and RPA calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations based on many-body perturbation theory (e.g. \textit{GW} or the random-phase approximation (RPA)) require function evaluations in the complex time and frequency domain, for example inhomogeneous Fourier transforms or analytic continuation from the imaginary axis to the real axis. For inhomogeneous Fourier transforms, the time-frequency component of the GreenX library provides time-frequency grids that can be utilized in low-scaling RPA and \textit{GW} implementations. In addition, the adoption of the compact frequency grids provided by our library also reduces the computational overhead in RPA implementations with conventional scaling. In this work, we present low-scaling \textit{GW} and conventional RPA benchmark calculations using the GreenX grids with different codes (FHI-aims, CP2K and ABINIT) for molecules, two-dimensional materials and solids. Very small integration errors are observed when using 30 time-frequency points for our test cases, namely $&lt;10^{-8}$\,eV/electron for the RPA correlation energies, and $\le 10$~meV for the $GW$ quasiparticle energies.</description>

      <title>A Two-Field-Scan Harmonic Hall Voltage Analysis For Fast, Accurate Quantification Of Spin-Orbit Torques In Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiencies of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) play a key role in the determination of the power consumption, integration density, and endurance of SOT-driven devices. Accurate and time-efficient determination of the SOT efficiencies is of great importance not only for evaluating the practical potential of SOT devices but also for developing new mechanisms for enhancing the SOT efficiencies. Here, we develop a "two-field-scan" harmonic Hall voltage (HHV) analysis that collects the second HHV as a function of a swept in-plane magnetic field at 45{\deg} and 0{\deg} relative to the excitation current. We demonstrate that this two-field-scan analysis is as accurate as the well-established but time-consuming angle-scan HHV analysis even in the presence of considerable thermoelectric effects but takes more than a factor of 7 less measurement time. We also show that the 3-parameter fit of the HHV data from a single field scan at 0{\deg}, which is commonly employed in the literature, is not reliable because the employment of too many free parameters in the fitting of the very slowly varying HHV signal allows unrealistic pseudo-solution and thus erroneous conclusion about the SOT efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polyalkylfluorene Conjugated Polymers: Insights from Neutron Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of the conjugated polymers poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) and poly(9,9-didodecylfluorene) (PF12), differing by the length of their side chains, is investigated in the amorphous phase using the quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) technique. The neutron spectroscopy measurements are synergistically underpinned by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The probe is focused on the picosecond time scale where the structural dynamics of both PF8 and PF12 would mainly be dominated by the motions of their side chains. The measurements highlighted temperature-induced dynamics reflected in the broadening of the QENS spectra upon heating. The MD simulations reproduced well the observations, hence the neutron measurements validate the MD force fields, the adopted amorphous model structures and the numerical procedure. As the QENS spectra are dominated by the signal from the hydrogens on the backbones and side chains of PF8 and PF12, extensive analysis of the MD simulations allowed: (i) tagging these hydrogens, (ii) estimating their contributions to the self part of the van Hove functions and hence to the QENS spectra, and (iii) determining the activation energies of the different motions involving the tagged hydrogens. PF12 is found to exhibit broader QENS spectra than PF8, signature of a more pronounced motions of the didodecyl chains as compared to dioctyl chains. This is in agreement with the outcome of our MD analysis: (i) confirming a lower glass transition temperature of PF12 compared to PF8, (ii) showing PF12 having a lower density than PF8, and (iii) highlighting lower activation energies of the motions of PF12 in comparison with PF8. This study helped gaining insights into the temperature-induced side chains dynamics of the PF8 and PF12 conjugated polymers influencing their stability, and thus could practically impact the performance of the associated optoelectronic active layer.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Intrinsic Spin Hall Effect by Charge Density Wave Order in Topological Kagome Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals are topological materials with a rich phase diagram featuring various charge density wave orders and even unconventional superconductivity. However, little is still known about possible spin-polarized responses in these non-magnetic compounds. Here, we perform ab-initio calculations of the intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K), CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. We report large spin Hall conductivities, comparable with the Weyl semimetal TaAs. Additionally, in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ the SHE is strongly renormalized by the CDW order. We can understand these results based on the topological properties of band structures, demonstrating that the SHE is dominated by the position and shape of the Dirac nodal lines in the kagome sublattice. Our results suggest kagome materials as a promising, tunable platform for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model to describe the fluctuations in the internal magnetic field due to ion dynamics observed in the muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) by an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function that separates the quasi-static and dynamic components of the correlation by a parameter $Q$ (where $0\le Q\le1$). Our Monte Carlo simulations for this model showed that the time evolution of muon spin polarization deviates significantly from the Kubo-Toyabe (KT) function. To further validate the model, the results of simulations were compared with the $\mu$SR spectra observed in a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite FAPbI$_3$ [with FA referring to HC(NH$_2)_2$], where local field fluctuations associated with the rotational motion of FA molecules and quasi-static fields from the PbI$_3$ lattice are presumed to coexist. The least-squares curve fitting showed reasonable agreement with the model with $Q=0.947(3)$, and the fluctuation frequency of the dynamical component was obtained. This result opens the door to the possibility of experimentally distinguishing fluctuations due to dynamics of ions around muons from those due to self-diffusion of muons. Meanwhile, it suggests the need to carefully consider the spin relaxation function when applying $\mu$SR to the issue of ion dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Rare-earth-based triangular-lattice magnets provide the fertile ground to explore the exotic quantum magnetic state. Herein, we report a new family of RE-based triangular-lattice magnets Ba6RE2Ti4O17(RE= rare earth ions) crystallized into the hexagonal structure with space group of P63 mmc, where magnetic rare earth ions form an ideal triangular lattice within the ab-plane and stack in an AA -type fashion along the c-axis. The low-temperature magnetic susceptibility results reveal all the serial compounds have the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions and an absence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. The magnetization and electron spin resonance results indicate distinct magnetic anisotropy for the compounds with different RE ions. Moreover, Ba6Nd2Ti4O17 single crystal is successfully grown and it exhibits strong Ising like anisotropy with magnetic easy-axis perpendicular to the triangle-lattice plane, being a candidate to explore quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising-type interaction.</description>

      <title>In situ coherent X-ray scattering reveals polycrystalline structure and discrete annealing events in strongly-coupled nanocrystal superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solution-phase bottom up self-assembly of nanocrystals into superstructures such as ordered superlattices is an attractive strategy to generate functional materials of increasing complexity, including very recent advances that incorporate strong interparticle electronic coupling. While the self-assembly kinetics in these systems have been elucidated and related to the product characteristics, the weak interparticle bonding interactions suggest the superstructures formed could continue to order within the solution long after the primary nucleation and growth have occurred, even though the mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated. Here, we use a combination of Bragg coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to create real-space maps of supercrystalline order along with a real-time view of the strain fluctuations in aging strongly coupled nanocrystal superlattices while they remain suspended and immobilized in solution. By combining the results, we deduce that the self-assembled superstructures are polycrystalline, initially comprising multiple nucleation sites, and that shear avalanches at grain boundaries continue to increase crystallinity long after growth has substantially slowed. This multimodal approach should be generalizable to characterize a breadth of materials in situ in their native chemical environments, thus extending the reach of high-resolution coherent X-ray characterization to the benefit of a much wider range of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting phonon thermal transport in two-dimensional gallium nitride: higher-order phonon-phonon and phonon-electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies showed that higher-order phonon-phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D-GaN, which exhibits noticeable discrepancies with lattice thermal conductivity calculated from molecular dynamics. In this work, it is found that the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite different method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The lattice thermal conductivity from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron-phonon interactions have significant effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of phonon-electron interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of both n-type and p-type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon-electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic and structural phase transitions occurring in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ were studied by macroscopic and microscopic techniques. Structural phase transitions associated with rotations of the ReCl$_6$ octahedra lower the symmetry from cubic to monoclinic, form ferroelastic domains, and are visible in susceptibility, specific heat and thermal expansion measurements. In the antiferromagnetically ordered state slightly below $T_{\rm N}$=12\,K these domains can be rearranged by a magnetic field inducing a relative elongation of the polydomain crystal parallel to the field of 0.6\%. At zero field the magnetic structure in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ does not exhibit a weak ferromagnetic component, but at large magnetic field a distinct magnetic structure with a finite weak ferromagnetic component is stabilized. High magnetic fields rearrange the domains in the crystal to align the weak ferromagnetic moment parallel to the field. The altered domain structure with the crystal elongation is abruptly suppressed at lower temperature but persists upon heating to well above $T_{\rm N}$. However, heating above the lowest structural phase transition and successive cooling restore the initial shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments reported an antisymmetric planar Hall effect, where the Hall current is odd in the in-plane magnetic field and scales linearly with both electric and magnetic fields applied. Existing theories rely exclusively on a spin origin, which requires spin-orbit coupling to take effect. Here, we develop a general theory for the intrinsic planar Hall effect (IPHE), highlighting a previously unknown orbital mechanism and connecting it to a band geometric quantity -- the anomalous orbital polarizability (AOP). Importantly, the orbital mechanism does not request spin-orbit coupling, so sizable IPHE can occur and is dominated by orbital contribution in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate our theory with quantitative evaluation for bulk materials $\mathrm{TaSb_{2}}$, $\mathrm{NbAs_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{SrAs_{3}}$. We further show that AOP and its associated orbital IPHE can be greatly enhanced at topological band crossings, offering a new way to probe topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in quantum materials is of great importance and leads to novel nonreciprocal charge transport. The topological insulator system provides a unique platform to study nonreciprocal charge transport due to the exotic surface states, especially the quantum Hall states under external magnetic field. Here, we report the observation of novel nonreciprocal charge transport mediated by the quantum Hall state in intrinsic topological insulator Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S devices, which is attributed to the asymmetric scattering between the edge state and the Landau orbits. A giant nonreciprocal coefficient of up to 2.26*10^5 A^-1 is also found. Our work not only reveals the properties of nonreciprocal charge transport of quantum Hall states in topological insulators, but also paves the way for future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Activating the fluorescence of a Ni(II) complex by energy transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luminescence of open-shell 3d metal complexes is often quenched due to ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) and cooling into a dark metal-centered excited state. We demonstrate successful activation of fluorescence from individual nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by resonant energy transfer from other metal phthalocyanines at low temperature. By combining STM, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, STM- induced luminescence, and photoluminescence experiments as well as time-dependent density functional theory, we provide evidence that there is an activation barrier for the ISC, which in most experimental conditions is overcome. We show that this is also the case in an electroluminescent tunnel junction where individual NiPc molecules adsorbed on an ultrathin NaCl decoupling film on a Ag(111) substrate are probed. However, when placing an MPc (M = Zn, Pd, Pt) molecule close to NiPc by means of STM atomic manipulation, resonant energy transfer can excite NiPc without overcoming the ISC activation barrier, leading to Q-band fluorescence. This work demonstrates that the thermally activated population of dark metal-centered states can be avoided by a designed local environment at low temperatures paired with a directed molecular excitation into vibrationally cold electronic states. Thus, we can envisage the use of luminophores based on more abundant transition metal complexes that do not rely on Pt or Ir.</description>

      <title>Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics in Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that dynamics of the magnetization in ferromagnets can pump the orbital angular momentum, which we denote by orbital pumping. This is the reciprocal phenomenon to the orbital torque that induces magnetization dynamics by the orbital angular momentum in non-equilibrium. The orbital pumping is analogous to the spin pumping established in spintronics but requires the spin-orbit coupling for the orbital angular momentum to interact with the magnetization. We develop a formalism that describes the generation of the orbital angular momentum by magnetization dynamics within the adiabatic perturbation theory. Based on this, we perform first-principles calculation of the orbital pumping in prototypical $3d$ ferromagnets, Fe, Co, and Ni. The results show that the ratio between the orbital pumping and the spin pumping ranges from 5 to 15 percents, being smallest in Fe and largest in Ni. This implies that ferromagnetic Ni is a good candidate for measuring the orbital pumping. Implications of our results on experiments are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Molecular orbital formation and metastable short-range ordered structure in VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in vanadium dioxide VO$_2$ due to V-V dimerization has been extensively discussed for decades. While it is widely acknowledged that electron correlations, Peierls instabilities, and molecular orbital formations are crucial for understanding the MIT of VO$_2$, the primary origin of the MIT remains controversial. In this study, we delve into the crystal structure and orbital state of VO$_2$ through synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments. The molecular orbital formation corresponding to the V-V dimerization is directly observed in the low-temperature insulating monoclinic phase, called the M1 phase, as indicated by the valence electron density distribution. Moreover, diffuse scattering observed in the high-temperature metal phase of rutile structure suggests the presence of short-range correlation of V displacements, which is not directly attributed to the structural fluctuation of the M1 phase. The short-range order in the rutile phase will be the key to understanding the MIT in this system.</description>

      <title>Electronic Transport and Fermi Surface Topology of Zintl phase Dirac Semimetal SrZn2Ge2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study on the electronic transport properties of SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystals. The in-plane electrical resistivity of the compound exhibits linear temperature dependence for 80 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K, and T^2 dependence below 40 K, consistent with the Fermi liquid behavior. Both the transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibit a crossover at critical field B* from weak-field quadratic-like to high-field unsaturated linear field dependence at low temperatures (T \leq 50 K). Possible sources of linear magnetoresistance are discussed based on the Fermi surface topology, classical and quantum transport models. The Hall resistivity data establish SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a multiband system with contributions from both the electrons and holes. The Hall coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing temperature and magnetic field, changing its sign from positive to negative. The negative Hall coefficient observed at low temperatures in high fields and at high temperatures over the entire field range suggests that the highly mobile electron charge carriers dominate the electronic transport. Our first-principles calculations show that nontrivial topological surface states exist in SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ within the bulk gap along the {\Gamma}-M path. Notably, these surface states extend from the valence to conduction band with their number varying based on the Sr and Ge termination plane. The Fermi surface of the compound exhibits a distinct tetragonal petal-like structure, with one open and several closed surfaces. Overall, these findings offer crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying the electronic transport of the compound.</description>

      <title>Optical wood with switchable solar transmittance for all-round thermal management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technologies enabling passive daytime radiative cooling and daylight harvesting are highly relevant for energy-efficient buildings. Despite recent progress demonstrated with passively cooling polymer coatings, however, it remains challenging to combine also a passive heat gain mechanism into a single substrate for all-round thermal management. Herein, we developed an optical wood (OW) with switchable transmittance of solar irradiation enabled by the hierarchically porous structure, ultralow absorption in solar spectrum and high infrared absorption of cellulose nanofibers. After delignification, the OW shows a high solar reflectance (94.9%) in the visible and high broadband emissivity (0.93) in the infrared region (2.5-25 $\mu$m). Owing to the exceptional mass transport of its aligned cellulose nanofibers, OW can quickly switch to a new highly transparent state following phenylethanol impregnation. The solar transmittance of optical wood (OW-II state) can reach 68.4% from 250 to 2500 nm. The switchable OW exhibits efficient radiative cooling to 4.5 {\deg}C below ambient temperature in summer (81.4 W m$^{-2}$ cooling power), and daylight heating to 5.6 {\deg}C above the temperature of natural wood in winter (heating power 229.5 W m$^{-2}$), suggesting its promising role as a low-cost and sustainable solution to all-season thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in charge-compensated topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a systematic study of thermal and charge transport in various single crystals of compensated topological insulators we identify the evolution of a large low-temperature thermal Hall effect as a characteristic common feature. In order to separate phononic and electronic contributions in the measured longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity, the electronic contributions are estimated from corresponding electrical resisivity and Hall effect measurements on the same samples by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. As may be expected for charge-compensated topological insulators the longitudinal thermal conductivity is phonon-dominated in all samples. However, we also find a pronounced field-linear thermal Hall effect that becomes most pronounced in the low-temperature range, where all samples are good electrical insulators. This indicates an underlying phononic mechanism of the thermal Hall effect and in this respect the topological insulators resemble other, mainly ionic, insulators, which have been reported to show a phonon-induced thermal Hall effect, but its underlying phononic mechanism remains to be identified. Our observation of a comparable thermal Hall ratio in topological insulators supports a theoretical scenario that explains a thermal Hall effect through skew scattering on charged impurities.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interface on Density and Elastic Moduli of $\textbf{Al/C}_{60}$ Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper analyzes theoretically the influence of fullerenes on the characteristics of $\mathrm{Al/C}_{60}$ composites. The molecular dynamics method is used to study the dependences of density and stiffness constants on the concentration of inclusions, and to calculate the values of the bulk and shear moduli for isotropic polycrystalline nanocomposites. The analysis shows that interfacial interaction significantly affects the properties of nanocomposites. This effect can be taken into account within the framework of the theory of heterogeneous media using the interphase layer model. The properties of the interphase layer are determined by interfacial interaction and can be calculated by approximating the results of molecular dynamics calculations. Using assumptions about the simplified form of the two-particle distribution function allows the interfacial interaction energy to be calculated and the interphase layer properties to be assessed analytically. The paper compares numerical results and analytical estimates, and discusses the validity of the approximations used. The analysis performed on the example of an $\mathrm{Al/C}_{60}$ composite material demonstrates the feasibility of using the analytical model of the interphase layer to estimate the effective density and elastic moduli of heterogeneous media with nano-inhomogeneities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a table-top setup for femtosecond x-ray absorption spectroscopy based on high harmonic generation (HHG) in noble gases. Using sub-millijoule pump pulses at a central wavelength of 1550 nm broadband HHG in the range 70 to 350 eV was demonstrated. The HHG coherence lengths of several millimeters were achieved by reaching the nonadiabatic regime of harmonic generation. NEXAFS experiments on the boron K edge of a boron foil and a hexagonal BN (hBN) 2D material demonstrate the capabilities of the setup.</description>
