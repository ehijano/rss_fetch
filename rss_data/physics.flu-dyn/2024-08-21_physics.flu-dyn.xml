      <title>The effect of normal electric fields on the Stokes drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In periodic wave motion, particles beneath the wave undergo a drift in the direction of wave propagation, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift. While extensive research has been conducted on Stokes drift in water wave flows, its counterpart in electrohydrodynamic flows remains relatively unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate Stokes drift beneath periodic traveling irrotational waves on a dielectric fluid under the effect of normal electric fields. Through numerical simulations utilizing conformal mapping, we compute particle trajectories and analyze the resultant Stokes drift behaviors beneath periodic traveling waves. Our findings indicate that variations in the electric field impact particle velocities while maintaining trajectory shapes. Moreover, the kinetic energy associated with a particle depends on its depth location and is a non-decreasing convex function in a moving frame and a constant in a laboratory frame.</description>

      <title>On the Quantization of the Motion of Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For building up a theory of superfluid Helium-4, Lev Landau ingeniously unified the principles of quantum mechanics with the principles of hydrodynamics. By introducing a velocity operator he was able to derive a quantum analogue of the mass density flux equation and a quantum Euler equation. The article shows that it is possible to formulate a consistent quantum theory of the ideal liquid based on Landau's Quantum Hydrodynamics. This means that it is added the quantum analogue of the momentum density flux equation, the energy density flux equation, the entropy density flux equation, and a quantum vorticity equation. These are all manifestly in agreement with the classical limit of the flux equations of classical ideal liquids. It is also shown that the various aspects that have been criticised about Landau's Quantum Hydrodynamics - e.g. the application of the inverse of the mass density operator - are not justified. Such a consistent quantum theory of an ideal liquid may therefore provide a starting point of a complementary approach in the theoretical research of superfluid Helium 4.</description>

      <title>Twist, turn and encounter: the trajectories of small atmospheric particles unravelled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every solid particle in the atmosphere, from ice crystals and pollen to dust, ash, and microplastics, is non-spherical. These particles play significant roles in Earth's climate system, influencing temperature, weather patterns, natural ecosystems, human health, and pollution levels. However, our understanding of these particles is largely based on the theories for extremely small particles and experiments conducted in liquid mediums. In this study, we used an innovative experimental setup and particle-resolved numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of sub-millimetre ellipsoids of varying shapes in the air. Our results revealed complex decaying oscillation patterns involving numerous twists and turns in these particles, starkly contrasting their dynamics in liquid mediums. We found that the frequency and decay rate of these oscillations have a strong dependence on the particle shape. Interestingly, disk-shaped particles oscillated at nearly twice the frequency of rod-shaped particles, though their oscillations also decayed more rapidly. During oscillation, even subtly non-spherical particles can drift laterally up to ten times their volume-equivalent spherical diameter. This behaviour enables particles to sweep through four times more air both vertically and laterally compared to a volume-equivalent sphere, significantly increasing their encounter rate and aggregation possibility. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-range transport and naturally occurring aggregate formation of highly non-spherical particles such as snowflakes and volcanic ash.</description>

      <title>Rheological behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks under electric fields: influence of concentration and voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.</description>

      <title>Transition route to elastic and elasto-inertial turbulence in polymer channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic shear flows support additional chaotic states beyond simple Newtonian turbulence. In vanishing Reynolds number flows, the nonlinearity in the polymer evolution equation alone can sustain inertialess 'elastic' turbulence (ET) while 'elasto-inertial' turbulence (EIT) appears to rely on an interplay between elasticity and finite-$Re$ effects. Despite their distinct phenomenology and industrial significance, transition routes and possible connections between these states are unknown. We identify here a common Ruelle-Takens transition scenario for both of these chaotic regimes in two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of FENE-P fluids in a straight channel. The primary bifurcation is caused by a recently-discovered 'polymer diffusive instability' associated with small but non-vanishing polymer stress diffusion which generates a finite-amplitude, small-scale travelling wave localised at the wall. This is found to be unstable to a large-scale secondary instability which grows to modify the whole flow before itself breaking down in a third bifurcation to either ET or EIT. The secondary large-scale instability waves resemble 'centre' and 'wall' modes respectively - instabilities which have been conjectured to play a role in viscoelastic chaotic dynamics but were previously only thought to exist far from relevant areas of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Strategy for Improving Aortic Blood Flow Simulations with Boundary Control and Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding time-dependent blood flow dynamics in arteries is crucial for diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases. However, accurately predicting time-varying flow patterns requires integrating observational data with computational models in a dynamic environment. This study investigates the application of data assimilation and boundary optimization techniques to improve the accuracy of time-dependent blood flow simulations. We propose an integrated approach that combines data assimilation methods with boundary optimization strategies tailored for time-dependent cases. Our method aims to minimize the disparity between model predictions and observed data over time, thereby enhancing the fidelity of time-dependent blood flow simulations. Using synthetic time-series observational data with added noise, we validate our approach by comparing its predictions with the known exact solution, computing the L2 norm to demonstrate improved accuracy in time-dependent blood flow simulations. Our results indicate that the optimization process consistently aligns the optimized data with the exact data. In particular, velocity magnitudes showed reduced discrepancies compared to the noisy data, aligning more closely with the exact solutions. The analysis of pressure data revealed a remarkable correspondence between the optimized and exact pressure values, highlighting the potential of this methodology for accurate pressure estimation without any previous knowledge on this quantity. Furthermore, wall shear stress (WSS) analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of our optimization scheme in reducing noise and improving prediction of a relevant indicator determined at the postprocessing level. These findings suggest that our approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of blood flow simulations, ultimately contributing to better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Durotaxis and antidurotaxis droplet motion onto gradient gel-substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-sustained motion of fluids on gradient substrates is a spectacular phenomenon, which can be employed and controlled in applications by carefully engineering the substrate properties. Here, we report on a design of a gel substrate with stiffness gradient, which can cause the spontaneous motion of a droplet along (durotaxis) or to the opposite (antidurotaxis) direction of the gradient, depending on the droplet affinity to the substrate. By using extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model, we find that the mechanisms of the durotaxis and antidurotaxis droplet motion are distinct, require the minimization of the interfacial energy between the droplet and the substrate, and share similarities with those mechanisms previously observed for brush substrates with stiffness gradient. Moreover, durotaxis motion takes place over a wider range of affinities and is generally more efficient (faster motion) than antidurotaxis. Thus, our study points to further possibilities and guidelines for realizing both antidurotaxis and durotaxis motion on the same gradient substrate for applications in microfluidics, energy conservation, and biology.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale interactions in turbulent mixed convection drive efficient transport of Lagrangian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When turbulent convection interacts with a turbulent shear flow, the cores of convective cells become aligned with the mean current, and these cells (which span the height of the domain) may interact with motions closer to the solid boundary. In this work, we use coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow to demonstrate that under conditions of turbulent mixed convection, interactions between motions associated with ejections and low-speed streaks near the solid boundary, and coherent superstructures in the interior of the flow interact and lead to significant vertical transport of strongly settling Lagrangian particles. We show that the primary suspension mechanism is associated with strong ejection events (canonical low-speed streaks and hairpin vortices characterized by $u'&lt;0$ and $w'&gt;0$), whereas secondary suspension is strongly associated with large scale plume structures aligned with the mean shear (characterized by $w'&gt;0$ and $\theta'&gt;0$). This coupling, which is absent in the limiting cases (pure channel flow or free convection) is shown to lead to a sudden increase in the interior concentration profiles as $\mathrm{Ri}_\tau$ increases, resulting in concentrations that are larger by roughly an order of magnitude at the channel midplane.</description>

      <title>CRKSPH - A Conservative Reproducing Kernel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.00725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that utilizes a first-order consistent reproducing kernel, a smoothing function that exactly interpolates linear fields with particle tracers. Previous formulations using reproducing kernel (RK) interpolation have had difficulties maintaining conservation of momentum due to the fact the RK kernels are not, in general, spatially symmetric. Here, we utilize a reformulation of the fluid equations such that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved without any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining approximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a rigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution equations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice of full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the increased accuracy of the RK method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter for the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally incurred by the ordinary SPH artificial viscosity. Collectively, we call our suite of modifications to the traditional SPH scheme Conservative Reproducing Kernel SPH, or CRKSPH. CRKSPH retains many benefits of traditional SPH methods (such as preserving Galilean invariance and manifest conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) while improving on many of the shortcomings of SPH, particularly the overly aggressive artificial viscosity and zeroth-order inaccuracy. We compare CRKSPH to two different modern SPH formulations (pressure based SPH and compatibly differenced SPH), demonstrating the advantages of our new formulation when modeling fluid mixing, strong shock, and adiabatic phenomena.</description>

      <title>upstreamFoam: an OpenFOAM-based solver for heterogeneous porous media at different scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03390v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new OpenFOAM application to simulate multiphase flows in porous media is formulated and tested. The proposed solver combines the Eulerian multi-fluid formulation for a system of phase fractions with Darcy's law for flows through porous media. It is based on the multiphaseEulerFoam and includes models for reservoir simulation of the porousMultiphaseFoam, taking advantage of the most recent technologies developed for these well-established solvers. With such an innovative combination, we are able to simulate a system of any number of compressible phase fractions in reservoirs that rely on specialized models for relative permeability, capillary pressure, and time step selection. We successfully validate the solver for classical problems with analytical, semi-analytical, and reference solutions. A wide range of flows in porous media has been studied, demonstrating the potential of the solver to approximate complex multiphase problems.</description>

      <title>Is There a Scaling Law in the Inviscid Coalescence of Unequal-size Droplets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the coalescence of two unequal-size spherical liquid droplets in the inviscid regime, with an emphasis on exploring the scaling of the liquid bridge evolution. Our experiment suggests that the classical 1/2 power-law scaling for equal-size droplets still holds for the unequal-size situation of small size ratios, but it diverges as the size ratio increases. Employing an energy balance analysis, we develop a theoretical model to collapse the experimental data of different droplet size ratios. The model reveals an exponential dependence of the bridge's radial growth on time, implying an intrinsic breaking of scaling law. The scale-free evolution behavior is evident only at late coalescence time and large size ratio, which can be explained using the length and time scales obtained from the theory.</description>

      <title>Lubrication-mediated rebounds off fluid baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present herein the derivation of a lubrication-mediated (LM) quasi-potential model for droplet rebounds off deep liquid baths, assuming the presence of a persistent dynamic air layer which acts as a lubricating pressure transfer. We then present numerical simulations of the LM model for axisymmetric rebounds of solid spheres and compare quantitatively to current results in the literature, including experimental data in the low speed impact regime. In this regime the LM model has the advantage of being far more computationally tractable than DNS and is also able to provide detailed behaviour within the micro-metric thin lubrication region. The LM system has an interesting mathematical structure, with the lubrication layer providing a free boundary elliptic problem mediating the drop and bath free-boundary evolutionary equations.</description>
