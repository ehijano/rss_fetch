      <title>First Principles Excitons in Periodic Systems with Gaussian Density Fitting and Ewald Potential Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, namely neutral excitations in a system of electrons arising from the electron-hole interaction, are often essential to explain optical measurements in materials. They are governed by the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which can be cast into a matrix form that is formally analogous to the one for electrons at the mean-field level. However, constructing the corresponding excitonic Hamiltonian in practice is challenging, specially from a computational perspective if one wishes to surpass effective models. Methods that enable such calculations from the different density-functional theory frameworks currently available are, therefore, convenient. In this work we present an approach to solve the BSE employing Gaussian basis functions starting from a self-consistent, possibly hybrid calculation in any non-metallic solid. It is based on the Gaussian density fitting or resolution of the identity approximation to reduce the initial quartic scaling in the basis dimension, in combination with the use of Ewald-type potential functions to automatically sum the conditionally convergent lattice series. As an illustration of the computational implementation, we provide examples of exciton spectra and optical absorption in some paradigmatic 2D and 3D materials where the single-particle approximation fails qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional Spin Dynamics in a Molecular Spin Liquid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular triangular lattice system, beta'-EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2, is considered as a candidate material for the quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, although ongoing debates arise from recent controversial results. Here, the results of electron spin resonance (ESR) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements on beta'-EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2 are presented. Both results indicate characteristic behaviors related to quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) spin dynamics, whereas the direction of anisotropy found in ESR is in contradiction with previous theories. We succeed in interpreting the experiments by combining density-functional theory calculations and analysis of the effective model taking into account the multi-orbital nature of the system. While the QSL-like origin of beta'-EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2 was initially attributed to the magnetic frustration of the triangular lattice, it appears that the primary origin is a 1D spin liquid resulting from the dimensional reduction effect.</description>

      <title>Role of non-magnetic spacers in the magnetic interactions of antiferromagnetic topological insulators MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ belongs to a family of antiferromagnetic topological insulators. It forms a natural heterostructure of magnetic (septuple) and non-magnetic (quintuple) topological blocks. Here, we explore the magnetism and magnetic interactions in this compound using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that the interlayer magnetic coupling is much weaker in MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ as compared to MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ due to the insertion of non-magnetic quintuple layers in the former. However, other key magnetic energy scales residing within a single septuple block, the single-ion anisotropy and long-range intralayer exchanges, are essentially the same. This identifies a transferable set of magnetic interactions applicable to the extended family of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Induced Polar Order in Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs), broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling result in spin-valley lock-in effects so that the valley degeneracy may be lifted by external magnetic fields, potentially leading to real-space structural transformation. Here, we report magnetic field (B)-induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back-gate voltages in ML-MoS2 field-effect transistors (FETs) on SiO2/Si at temperatures &lt; 20 K. The observed hysteresis increases with |B| up to 12 T and is tunable by varying the temperature. Raman spectroscopic and scanning tunneling microscopic studies reveal significant lattice expansion with increasing |B| at 4.2 K, and this lattice expansion becomes asymmetric in ML-MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to out-of-plane mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of a tunable out-of-plane ferroelectric-like polar order. This broken symmetry-induced polarization in ML-MoS2 shows typical ferroelectric butterfly hysteresis in piezo-response force microscopy, adding ML-MoS2 to the single-layer material family that exhibit out-of-plane polar order-induced ferroelectricity, which is promising for such technological applications as cryo-temperature ultracompact non-volatile memories, memtransistors, and ultrasensitive magnetic field sensors. Moreover, the polar effect induced by asymmetric lattice expansion may be further generalized to other ML-TMDs and achieved by nanoscale strain engineering of the substrate without magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Magnon-phonon interactions in the spinel compound MnSc$_2$Se$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of MnSc$_2$Se$_4$ single crystals at low temperature under a magnetic field directed along the crystallographic [111] axis. The magnetization data at low temperature show a linear increase with magnetic field, until saturation is reached above 15 T. In ultrasound, a longitudinal acoustic mode shows a softening in field, which is absent for a transverse acoustic mode. We discuss these results using a microscopic model based on the framework of linear spin-wave theory. The magnetic and magnetoelastic data are qualitatively reproduced by considering magnon-phonon interactions arising from exchange-striction coupling between the crystal lattice and spin-wave fluctuations in the zero-temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Kohn anomaly in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has attracted great interest in the last decade due to the novel properties it exhibited. It was revealed that e-phonon interaction plays an important role in a variety of phenomena in this system, such as superconductivity and exotic phases. However, due to its complexity, the e-phonon interaction in TBG is not well studied yet. In this work, we study the electron interaction with the acoustic phonon mode in twisted bilayer graphene and one of its consequences, i.e., the Kohn anomaly. The Kohn anomaly in ordinary metals usually happens at phonon momentum q = 2kF as a dramatic modification of the phonon frequency when the phonon wave vector nests the electron Fermi surface. However, novel Kohn anomaly can happen in topological semimetals, such as graphene and Weyl semimetals. In this work, we show that the novel dynamic Kohn anomaly can also take place in twisted bilayer graphene due to the nesting of two different Moire Dirac points by the phonon wave vector. Moreover, by tuning the twist angle, the dynamic Kohn anomaly in TBG shows different features. Particularly, at magic angle when the electron bandwidth is almost flat, the dynamic Kohn anomalies of acoustic phonons disappear. We also studied the effects of finite temperature and doping on the dynamic Kohn anomaly in TBG and discussed the experimental methods to observe the Kohn anomaly in such system.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Chern number via quench dynamics in two independent chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chern number, as a topological invariant, characterizes the topological features of a 2D system and can be experimentally detected through Hall conductivity. In this work, we investigate the connection between the Chern number and the features of two independent chains. It is shown that there exists a class of 2D systems that can be mapped into two independent chains. We demonstrate that the Chern number is identical to the linking number of two loops, which are abstracted from each chain individually. This allows for the detection of the Chern number via quench dynamics in two independent chains. As an example, the Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) model is employed to illustrate the scheme. Our finding provides a way to measure the phase diagram of a 2D system from the 1D systems.</description>

Abstract: Until recently, all known ordered II-IV-N2 materials crystallised in the $\beta$-NaFeO$_2$-type in space group Pna2$_1$. BeGeN$_2$, however, crystallises in space group Pmc2$_1$, with a different cation ordering motif long anticipated for this materials class. Chemical bonding analysis is used to rationalise this particular behaviour.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect and optical magneto-conductivity of two-dimensional topological nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a gapped two-dimensional nodal-line semimetal subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. We identify an unusual pattern for Landau levels, where the energy of Landau levels first decreases and then starts increasing versus the level index. These descending/ascending Landau levels form a stretched check-mark shape. Tuning the magnitude of the magnetic field changes the spacing between Landau levels. At fixed chemical potential in the low doped regime, the Landau levels move below the chemical potential and get filled from one side, while they move out and get vacant from the other side. Using the Kubo formalism in the linear response theory, we analytically study a gapped nodal-line semimetal's longitudinal and Hall conductivities. In the DC limit, we observe that as the magnetic field is varied at a fixed chemical potential, the Chern number swings back and forth between two consecutive integer numbers, giving rise to bumpy Hall plateaus in a low-doped system. We also find that the longitudinal optical conductivity displays different series of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, corresponding to inter-band and intra-band transition among the descending and ascending sets of the Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Stacking engineering in orthogonally-twisted two-dimensional CrSBr magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>

      <title>Quantum magic dynamics in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic refers to the degree of "quantumness" in a system that cannot be fully described by stabilizer states and Clifford operations alone. In quantum computing, stabilizer states and Clifford operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, even though they may appear complicated from the perspective of entanglement. In this sense, magic is a crucial resource for unlocking the unique computational power of quantum computers to address problems that are classically intractable. Magic can be quantified by measures such as Wigner negativity and mana that satisfy fundamental properties such as monotonicity under Clifford operations. In this paper, we generalize the statistical mechanical mapping methods of random circuits to the calculation of Renyi Wigner negativity and mana. Based on this, we find: (1) a precise formula describing the competition between magic and entanglement in many-body states prepared under Haar random circuits; (2) a formula describing the the spreading and scrambling of magic in states evolved under random Clifford circuits; (3) a quantitative description of magic "squeezing" and "teleportation" under measurements. Finally, we comment on the relation between coherent information and magic.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Quantum Strings by Edge Defect in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers can grab particles with their laser beam fingers, so these tiny point objects can be moved by using the laser light. However, manipulation of topological defects, especially higher-dimension ones becomes extremely difficult because they usually require non-local operation involving a great deal of operators, e.g. string operator. Here, using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we demonstrate the quantum string excitation can be grabbed in the Kagome Rydberg atom array with well-designed edges. After inserting an edge defect, the fractional charge at one end of the string is found to be pinned, allowing the quantum string to be manipulated. Since the quantum string is directed, its quantum fluctuations can be clearly observed due to the movement of the dangling fractional charge at the other end. Then, we can drag the two ends of the string in opposite directions, which is analogous to the separation of a quark-anti-quark pair connected by a gluon string. As the separation distance increases, the quantum fluctuations of the string are strongly suppressed. Eventually, a string-breaking phenomenon occurs. However, if both edge defects are located on the same side, the strings are always broken because both dangling fractional charges take the same gauge charge and can not annihilate each other into the vacuum. This work not only proposes an ideal experimental platform for analyzing quantum string excitations in the ground state but also provides a much simpler method for manipulating quantum string excitations in frustrated systems, such as spin ice.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present the comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of n=4 and n=8 spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Pseudochaotic Many-Body Dynamics as a Pseudorandom State Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics in quantum simulations, namely 'pseudochaotic dynamics,' which generates computationally indistinguishable states from Haar-random states within the limited access to the measurement outcomes and runtime of quantum computations. While it is not chaotic, a defining characteristics of many-body quantum chaos, namely out-of-time-ordered correlators, fail to differentiate the pseudochaotic dynamics from chaotic one. We systematically construct such pseudochaotic unitary evolution and investigate their nature through extensive numerical and analytic calculations. Remarkably, we show that the pseudochaotic dynamics can generate a representative pseudo-quantum state, specifically a random subset-phase state, from initial computational states with a depth tightly bound by polylog(n) with the system size n, which opens up a practical route to realize pseudorandom states in near term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</title>

Abstract: Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</description>

      <title>The Composite Particle Duality: A New Class of Topological Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood either as a theoretical framework or as a dynamical physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field. In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. In 3+1D the mechanism of flux attachment induces a dynamical formation of dyons as higher-dimensional analogues of Laughlin quasiparticles. In 1+1D there is lack of flux attachment but a remnant in the form of a statistical gauge field can be explicitly constructed. We also introduce a family of interacting quantum many-body systems that undergo statistical transmutation as indicated by the duality. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases across dimensions both in lattice and continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Composite quadrupole order in ferroic and multiferroic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <title>Strange metal in the doped Hubbard model via percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many strongly correlated systems exhibit strange metallic behavior in certain parameter regimes characterized by anomalous transport properties that are irreconcilable with a Fermi-liquid-like description in terms of quasiparticles. The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical starting point to examine the properties of such systems and also exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior in simulations. Here we analytically study the two-dimensional hole-doped Hubbard model in the large $U$ limit, first identifying a doping-induced percolation transition in the low-energy sector occurring at a definite critical doping $p_c$ depending on lattice structure. Using the critical properties near this transition we rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian and motivate a low-energy lattice-independent large-$N$ model with distinct non-Fermi-liquid properties. We show that this model has linear-in-$T$ resistivity with doping-dependent slope maximized at $p=p_c$ and power-law optical conductivity $\sim |\omega|^{-2/3}$. Though the parameters used in developing this theory mean it cannot be directly applied to the cuprate superconductors, we nevertheless reproduce several important phenomena observed in their strange metal phase, and also predict these same qualitative behaviors to manifest in other lattices near concrete hole dopings.</description>

      <title>Phonon state tomography of electron correlation dynamics in optically excited solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce phonon state tomography (PST) as a diagnostic probe of electron dynamics in solids whose phonons are optically excited by a laser pulse at initial time. Using a projected-purified matrix-product states algorithm, PST decomposes the exact correlated electron-phonon wavefunction into contributions from purely electronic states corresponding to statistically typical configurations of the optically accessible phononic response, enabling a 'tomographic' reconstruction of the electronic dynamics generated by the phonons. Thus, PST may be used to diagnose electronic behavior in experiments that access only the phonon response, such as thermal diffuse x-ray and electron scattering. We study the dynamics of a metal whose infrared phonons are excited by an optical pulse at initial time and use it to simulate the sample-averaged momentum-resolved phonon occupancy and accurately reconstruct the electronic correlations. We also use PST to analyze the influence of different pulse shapes on the light-induced enhancement and suppression of electronic correlations.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out of equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous and impulsive stimulated Raman scattering from two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange interactions govern the ordering between microscopic spins and the highest-frequency spin excitations - magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. As well known from spontaneous Raman scattering (RS) experiments in antiferromagnets, such magnons couple to light in the form of two-magnon modes - pairs of magnon with opposite wavevectors. Experimental works on two-magnon modes driven by exchange perturbation in impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) experiment posed a question about consistency between spin dynamics measured in the ISRS and RS experiments. Here, based on an extended spin correlation pseudovector formalism, we derive the analytical expression for observables in both types of experiments to determine a possibly fundamental differences between the detected two-magnon spectra. We find that in both cases the magnons from the edge of the Brillouin zone give the largest contribution to the measured spectra. However, there is the difference in the spectra which stems from the fact that RS probes population of a continuum of incoherent modes, while in the case of impulsively driven modes, they are coherent and their phase and amplitudes are detected. We show that for the continuum of modes, the sensitivity to the phase results in a relative shift of the main peaks in the two spectra, and the spectrum of the ISRS is significantly broadened and extends to the range above the maximum two-magnon mode frequency. Formally, this is manifested in the fact, that the RS is described by an imaginary part of the Green function only, while the ISRS is described by the absolute value and hence additionally carries information about the real part of the Green function. We further derive two-magnon Raman tensor dispersion and the weighting factors, which define the features of the coupling to light of the modes from the different domains in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnon decays in dipolar quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous disintegration of magnons in two-dimensional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets dominated by long-range dipolar interactions. Analyzing kinematic constraints, we show that the unusual dispersion of dipolar ferromagnets in a uniform magnetic field precludes magnon-decay at all fields, in sharp contrast to short-range exchange-driven magnets. However, in a staggered magnetic field, magnons can decay in both dipolar ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Remarkably, such decays do not require a minimum threshold field, and happen over a nearly fixed fraction of the Brillouin Zone in the XY limit, highlighting the significant role played by dipolar interactions. In addition, topological transitions in the decay surfaces lead to singularities in the magnon spectrum. Regularizing such singular behavior via a self-consistent approach, we make predictions for dynamical spin correlations accessible to near-term quantum simulators and sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that flat bands and van Hove singularities near the magic angle can be stabilized against angle disorder in the twisted Kane-Mele model. With continuum model and maximally localized Wannier function approaches, we identify a quadratic dispersion relationship between the bandwidth, interaction parameters versus the twist angle, in contrast to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to TBG greatly reduces the fractional Chern insulator indicator and enhances the stability of fractional Chern states near the magic angle, as confirmed by exact diagonalization calculations. Moreover, in twisted bilayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling, we identify a topological flat band at a large twist angle around 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Kondo spectral functions at low-temperatures: A dynamical-exchange-correlation-field perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the low-temperature spectral function of the symmetric single impurity Anderson model using a recently proposed dynamical exchange-correlation (xc) field formalism. The xc field, coupled to the one-particle Green's function, is obtained through analytic analysis and numerical extrapolation based on finite clusters. In the Kondo regime, the xc field is modeled by an ansatz that takes into account the different asymptotic behaviors in the small- and large-time regimes. The small-time xc field contributes to the Hubbard side-band, whereas the large-time to the Kondo resonance. We illustrate these features in terms of analytical and numerical calculations for small- and medium-size finite clusters, and in the thermodynamic limit. The results indicate that the xc field formalism provides a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity in solving impurity problems. Consequently, it can significantly reduce the complexity of the many-body problem faced by first-principles approaches to strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the van der Walls material $\rm NiPS_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the magnetic excitation spectrum of the quantum magnet $\rm NiPS_3$ near the zig-zag ground state of a minimal honeycomb spin Hamiltonian that includes bilinear and biquadratic spin interactions. Our analysis, using a multi-boson generalized spin wave theory suited for spin S=1 systems, revealed two normal modes at the linear level. The one at lower energy corresponds to a single magnon mode, consistent with results from spectroscopy experiments. Without single-ion anisotropy, this mode features a Goldstone mode at the corner of the Brillouin zone. When single ion anisotropy is introduced, the zig-zag phase's global U(1) invariance is broken, resulting in a gap. The higher energy mode corresponds to two-magnon fluctuations, which appear at the harmonic level in the generalized spin wave theory. This mode forms a gapped flat band due to bilinear spin interactions and becomes dispersive when biquadratic interactions are considered. The higher energy dispersion is related to quadrupolar fluctuations, which are feasible in magnets where the order parameter fluctuates in the SU(3) space. The spectrum analysis yielded quantum corrections to the order parameter and detected instabilities in the $\rm NiPS_3$ dipolar phases. Identifying the highest energy branch in experiments could provide insight into hidden nematic orders in $\rm NiPS_3$ and other van der Waals magnets.</description>

Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chains. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming it is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point separating two T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. The lack of magnetic order above 0.3 K results from these quantum critical fluctuations, potentially compounded by Kondo moment compensation. Ti4MnBi2 provides the first experimental evidence that 1D magnetism, previously the exclusive domain of insulators, persists in metallic systems with moderate correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

      <title>Kondo Impurities at a Finite Concentration of Impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the Kondo impurity problem - at a finite concentration of impurities. We identify two parameter regimes for the Kondo impurity problem. 1) The single impurity limit, where the concentration of Kondo impurities is so low that the background scattering mechanisms (non-magnetic impurities, Umklapp scattering, etc.) of the metal considered are the dominant conduction electron scattering mechanisms at zero temperature. 2) The dilute impurity system limit where the concentration of magnetic impurities is such that they form the dominant mechanism of conduction electron scattering at zero temperature of the metal in question (this is accompanied by a variety of easily detectable Kondo signatures (resistance minimum, specific heat measurements, magnetization as a function of external magnetic field, conduction electron dephasing rates as well as ARPES, RIXS and NMR spectroscopies)) while still being very dilute. Most theoretical efforts are currently in regime where a single isolated impurity is considered - regime 1) while most experimental efforts are in regime 2). We present analytical evidence that this explains the well known discrepancy between experiment and theory as to the value of the Kondo temperature. We find that the ratio between the two Kondo temperatures in regime 1) and regime 2) is given by: $\mathcal{R}=\exp\left[\frac{\pi^{2}\rho v_{F}}{2k_{F}^{2}Vol}\right]$ where $\rho$ is the density of states, $v_{F}$ is the fermi velocity, and $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wavevector and $Vol$ is the volume of a unit cell. We note that there is no dependence on the impurity concentration in this ratio so it is possible to define a single Kondo temperature for limit 2) for the dilute Kondo impurity system. In this work we present results within the Reed-Newns Kondo meanfield approximation and to leading order of the linked cluster expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Structure and Magnetic Properties of a Maple Leaf antiferromagnet Ho$_3$ScO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ho$_3$ScO$_6$ harbours a frustrated Maple Leaf Lattice (MLL). It crystalizes in the Mg$_3$TeO$_6$-type structure, and has a centrosymmetric trigonal space group (R$\bar{3}$). This system contains stacked layers of magnetic rings along the c-axis consisting of six magnetic Ho$^{3+}$ ions forming Ho hexagons, which are connected into a 2-dimensional network by equilateral and isosceles triangles to form a rare example of a MLL. Long range magnetic order is reached below $T_N=4.1$ K with a 120$^\circ$ spin arrangement on the equilateral triangles resulting in a positive vector chirality ground state configuration.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave superconductivity: a microscopic model on 2D honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-density-wave (PDW) is a long-sought exotic state with oscillating superconducting order without external magnetic field. So far it has been rare in establishing a 2D microscopic model with PDW long-range order in its ground state. Here we propose to study PDW superconductivity in a minimal model of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $V_1$ and $V_2$, respectively. By performing a state-of-the-art density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of this $t$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model at finite doping on six-leg and eight-leg honeycomb cylinders, we showed that the ground state exhibits PDW ordering (namely quasi-long-range order with a divergent PDW susceptibility). Remarkably this PDW state persists on the wider cylinder with 2D-like Fermi surfaces (FS). To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of PDW in systems with 2D-like FS.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Characterization of Labyrinthine Pattern Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach to characterizing labyrinthine structures that often emerge as a final steady state in pattern forming systems. We employ advanced machine learning based pattern recognition techniques to identify the types and locations of topological defects of the local stripe ordering. Applying this method to single-crystal Bi-substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet films, we uncover a distinct morphological transition between two zero-field labyrinthine structures. Crucially, the pair distribution functions of the topological defects reveal subtle differences between labyrinthine structures which are beyond conventional characterization methods. By systematically analyzing the spatial correlations and geometric properties of these defects, we provide new insights into the athermal dynamics governing the observed morphological transitions. Our work demonstrates that machine learning based recognition techniques enable novel studies of rich and complex labyrinthine type structures universal to many pattern formation systems.</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <title>Electronic Bound States in the Continuum in a 2D Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states that remain localized despite existing within a continuum of extended, delocalized states. They defy conventional wave theories and could be instrumental for quantum technologies that rely on the precise control of quantum states. While optical BICs have been realized in photonic systems, achieving electronic bound states in a metallic background remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we observe two defect states that remain localized within the metallic continuum of Pd5AlI2, a two-dimensional van der Waals metal. The emergence of these states is a manifestation of the hopping interference in the Pd5AlI2 lattice. This interference results in a (quasi) flat band and spatially localized eigenstates that are orthogonal to the metallic continuum thus avoiding hybridization with extended states.</description>
