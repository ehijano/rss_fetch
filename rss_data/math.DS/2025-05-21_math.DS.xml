      <title>On stronger forms of Devaney chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study stronger forms of Devaney chaos and name it as $\mathscr{F}-$Devaney chaos, where $\mathscr{F}$ is a family of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. Examples of maps which is $\mathscr{F}_t-$Devaney chaotic but not $\mathscr{F}_{cf}-$Devaney chaotic, $\mathscr{F}_s-$Devaney chaotic but neither $\mathscr{F}_t-$Devaney chaotic nor $\mathscr{F}_{cf}-$Devaney chaotic are discussed. Further, we show that for the maps on infinite metric space without isolated points, $\mathscr{F}-$sensitivity is a redundant condition in the definition $\mathscr{F}-$Devaney chaos. Here $\mathscr{F}=\mathscr{F}_s, \: \mathscr{F}_t, \: \mathscr{F}_{ts}$ or $\mathscr{F}_{cf}$. We also obtain conditions under which Devaney chaos implies $\mathscr{F}_s-$Devaney chaos or $\mathscr{F}_t-$Devaney chaos. Next, we define the concept of $\left(\mathscr{F}, \mathscr{G}\right)-P-$chaos and obtain conditions under which $\left(\mathscr{F}_1, \mathscr{G}_1\right)-P-$chaos implies $\mathscr{F}-$Devaney chaos for different families $\mathscr{F}_1$ and $\mathscr{G}_1$.</description>

      <title>More on the Concept of Anti-integrability for H\'enon Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the family of H\'{e}non maps $(x,y)\mapsto (\sqrt{a}(1-x^2)-b y,x)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the so-called anti-integrable (AI) limit concerns the limit $a\to\infty$ with fixed Jacobian $b$. At the AI limit, the dynamics reduces to a subshift of finite type. There is a one-to-one correspondence between sequences allowed by the subshift and the AI orbits. The theory of anti-integrability says that each AI orbit can be continued to becoming a genuine orbit of the H\'{e}non map for $a$ sufficiently large (and fixed Jacobian).
  In this paper, we assume $b$ is a smooth function of $a$ and show that the theory can be extended to investigating the limit $\lim_{a\to\infty} b/\sqrt{a}=\hat{r}$ for any $\hat{r}&gt;0$ provided that the one dimensional quadratic map $x\mapsto \displaystyle\frac{1}{\hat{r}}(1-x^2)$ is hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: In this article we describe all possible infinite linear configurations that can be found in a shift of any set of positive upper Banach density. This simultaneously generalizes Szemer\'edi's theorem on arithmetic progressions and the recent density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson.</description>

      <title>Fourier Dimension in $C^{1+\alpha}$ Parabolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-smooth non-linearity condition for $C^{1+\alpha}$ Markov iterated function systems motivated by the proof of power Fourier decay of nonlinear 2D Axiom A equilibrium states, which was inspired by recent advances in exponential mixing for 3D Anosov flows. We verify this condition for a class of $C^{1+\alpha}$ systems using fixed point theory in space of Cantor functions, which gives first examples of truly $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs with positive Fourier dimension for their attractors. Moreover, the proof method also applies in smoother parabolic Markov systems including Young tower codings leading also to power Fourier decay for conformal measures for Manneville-Pommeau maps, Lorenz maps arising from the Lorenz system, and Patterson-Sullivan measures for cusped hyperbolic surfaces, generalising the work of Bourgain and Dyatlov to geometrically finite groups with parabolic elements. The lack of smoothness preventing the traditional use of spectral gaps for transfer operators is replaced with multiscale oscillations of the derivatives on Cantor sets allowing us to reduce to exponential sums of products of random variables with finite exponential moments.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of polynomial multiple ergodic averages along the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence for the polynomial multiple ergodic averages $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \La(n) f_1(T^{P_1(n)} x)\cdots f_k(T^{P_k(n)} x)$$ as $N\to \infty$, where $\La$ is the von Mangoldt function, $T \colon X \to X$ is an invertible measure-preserving transformation of a probability space $(X,\nu)$, $P_1,\ldots, P_k$ are polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees, and $f_1,\ldots,f_k\in L^\infty(X)$. This pointwise almost everywhere convergence result can be seen as a refinement of the norm convergence result obtained in Wooley--Ziegler (Amer. J. Math, 2012) in the case of polynomials with distinct degrees.
  Building on the foundational work of Krause--Mirek--Tao (Ann. of Math., 2022), Kosz--Mirek--Peluse--Wright (arXiv: 2411.09478, 2024), and Krause--Mousavi--Tao--Ter\"{a}v\"{a}inen (arXiv: 2409.10510, 2024), we develop a multilinear circle method for
  von Mangoldt-weighted (equivalently, prime-weighted) averages. This method combines harmonic analysis techniques across multiple groups with the newest inverse theorem from additive combinatorics. In particular, the principal innovations of this framework include:
  (i) an inverse theorem and a Weyl-type inequality for multilinear Cram\'{e}r-weighted averages; (ii) a multilinear Rademacher-Menshov inequality; and (iii) an arithmetic multilinear estimate.</description>

      <title>On Triangular Forms for x-Flat Control-Affine Systems With Two Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a broadly applicable triangular normal form for two-input x-flat control-affine systems. First, we show that this triangular form encompasses a wide range of established normal forms. Next, we prove that any x-flat system can be transformed into this triangular structure after a finite number of prolongations of each input. Finally, we introduce a refined algorithm for identifying candidates for x-flat outputs. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our results. In particular, we show that the refined algorithm exceeds the capabilities of existing methods for computing flat outputs based on triangular forms.</description>

      <title>Generalization Through Growth: Hidden Dynamics Controls Depth Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps \(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$ isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial (resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding) dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$ (sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms such as test-time inference and diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a probability measure preserving dynamical system $(\mathcal{X},f,\mu)$, the Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem asserts that $\mu$-almost every orbit is recurrent with respect to its initial condition. This motivates study of the statistics of the process $X_n(x)=\text{dist}(f^n(x),x))$, and real-valued functions thereof. For a wide class of non-uniformly expanding dynamical systems, we show that the time-$n$ counting process $R_n(x)$ associated to the number recurrences below a certain radii sequence $r_n(\tau)$ follows an \emph{averaged} Poisson distribution $G(\tau)$. Furthermore, we obtain quantitative results on almost sure rates for the recurrence statistics of the process $X_n$.</description>

      <title>From curve shortening to flat link stability and Birkhoff sections of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for closed connected orientable Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed connected orientable Riemannian surface.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive reduced-order modeling for dynamical systems with spatially localized features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling framework for dynamical systems with spatially localized features characterized by slow singular value decay. The proposed approach builds upon two existing methodologies for reduced and full-order non-intrusive modeling, namely Operator Inference (OpInf) and sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM) inference. We decompose the domain into two complementary subdomains that exhibit fast and slow singular value decay. The dynamics of the subdomain exhibiting slow singular value decay are learned with sFOM while the dynamics with intrinsically low dimensionality on the complementary subdomain are learned with OpInf. The resulting, coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation leverages the computational efficiency of OpInf and the high resolution of sFOM, and thus enables fast non-intrusive predictions for conditions beyond those sampled in the training data set. A novel regularization technique with a closed-form solution based on the Gershgorin disk theorem is introduced to promote stable sFOM and OpInf models. We also provide a data-driven indicator for subdomain selection and ensure solution smoothness over the interface via a post-processing interpolation step. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach in terms of offline and online speedup through a quantitative, parametric computational cost analysis. We demonstrate the coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation for two test cases: a one-dimensional Burgers' model for which accurate predictions beyond the span of the training snapshots are presented, and a two-dimensional parametric model for the Pine Island Glacier ice thickness dynamics, for which the OpInf-sFOM model achieves an average prediction error on the order of $1 \%$ with an online speedup factor of approximately $8\times$ compared to the numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of all smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Social Network of Individuals with Coevolving Actions and Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a population of individuals who have actions and opinions, which coevolve, mutually influencing one another on a complex network structure. In particular, we formulate a control problem for this social network, in which we assume that we can inject into the network a committed minority -- a set of stubborn nodes -- with the objective of steering the population, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. Our study focuses on two main objectives: i) determining the conditions under which the committed minority succeeds in its goal, and ii) identifying the optimal placement for such a committed minority. After deriving general monotone convergence result for the controlled dynamics, we leverage these results to build a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve the first problem and an effective heuristics for the second problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. For both algorithms, we establish theoretical guarantees. The proposed methodology is illustrated though academic examples, and demonstrated on a real-world case study.</description>
