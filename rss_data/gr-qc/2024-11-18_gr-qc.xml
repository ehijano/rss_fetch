      <title>Actions of spinning compact binaries: Spinning particle in Kerr matched to dynamics at 1.5 post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of compact binaries is influenced by the spin of their components starting at the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. On the other hand, in the large mass ratio limit, the spin of the lighter object appears in the equations of motion at first order in the mass ratio, coinciding with the leading gravitational self-force. Frame and gauge choices make it challenging to compare between the two limits, especially for generic spin configurations. We derive novel closed formulas for the gauge-invariant actions and frequencies for the motion of spinning test particles near Kerr black holes. We use this to express the Hamiltonian perturbatively in terms of action variables up to 3PN and compare it with the 1.5 PN action-angle Hamiltonian at finite mass ratios. This allows us to match the actions across both systems, providing a new gauge-invariant dictionary for interpolation between the two limits.</description>

      <title>Canonical analysis of unimodular Pleba\'nski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in an extended non-commutative foliated quantum gravity: the wave function of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel extension to the recently developed non-commutative Riemannian foliated branch-cut quantum gravity (BCQG). Based on an extended Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic deformation of the conventional Poisson algebra, we investigate non-commutativity effects on a symplectic topological manifold that provides a natural isomorphic setting composed by a triad of canonically conjugate scalar complex fields which comprise quantum complementary dualities. Based on a complementary analytically continued Friedmann-type equation, combined with a quantum approach based on the Ho\v{r}awa-Lifshitz quantum gravity, we describe the dynamic evolution of the universe's wave function, unfolding unprecedented predictions for the cosmic evolution and inflation. The non-commutative foliated quantum gravity approach offers a new perspective on explaining the accelerated cosmic expansion of the universe, strongly suggesting that non-commutative algebra induces the late accelerated growth of both the universe's wave function and the corresponding scale factor, along with their quantum counterparts. In contrast to the conventional inflationary model, where inflation requires a remarkably fine-tuned set of initial conditions in a patch of the universe, non-commutative foliated quantum gravity, analytically continued to the complex plane, captures short and long scales of spacetime, leading to an evolutionary cosmic dynamic through a topological reconfiguration of the primordial cosmic matter and energy content. This result introduces new speculative framework elements regarding the reconfiguration of matter and energy due to an underlying non-commutative spatio-temporal structure as a driver of spacetime cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order corrections to scalar perturbations of Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole demonstrates instability due to the superradiance of either a massive or massless scalar field. Previous leading-order approximations of the spectrum are inefficient. In particular, the leading-order real part of the eigenfrequency is insensitive to the spin of the black hole. In this work, we improve the analysis by including the next-to-leading-order contribution. Compared to the numerical calculation, the new spin-dependent real part presents significantly better agreement, and the error in the imaginary part is also reduced to less than 60% for most black hole spins.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Emission in Quadratic Gravity: longitudinal modes, angular momentum emission, and positivity of the radiated power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the emission of gravitational waves in quadratic gravity theory is examined. The wave equations for massless and massive perturbations are derived, followed by the calculation of the energy and angular momentum radiated. In the quadrupole approximation, and taking into account only the transverse-traceless modes, it is shown that the theory avoids the issues generated by the Ostrogradsky instabilities and achieves positive energy and angular momentum emissions. As an example, a rotating ellipsoid with free precession is analyzed, and the effects of the massive perturbations on its rotation are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Shadow and accretion disk images of Kerr-Newman black hole in modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the shadow and images of the accretion disk of Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) in modified gravity (MOG) theory by using backward ray-tracing method. And, the influence of spin parameter ($a$), charge ($Q$), and MOG parameter ($\alpha$) on the observed features of BHs are carefully addressed. Interestingly, as $\alpha$ increases, the flat edge of the BH's shadow gradually becomes more rounded, the size of shadow enlarges, and the deviation rate ($\delta s$) correspondingly decreases. By tracing the photon around BH, we observe that the trajectory of photon exhibits distortion behavior, i.e., the formation of two "tails" near the Einstein ring, which elongate as $a$ increases. For the accretion disk, it shows that the inner shadow expands with $\alpha$, while decreases with $Q$. The increase of $\alpha$ exhibits an increasing effect on redshift. At the same parameter level, $\alpha$ has a more obvious effect on inner shadow and image of BH by comparing with that of $Q$. Our study implies that both $\alpha$ and $Q$ have relatively significant effects on the image of the KN-MOG BH with the thin disk accretion, but the influence of $\alpha$ is much greater. So, this indicates that $\alpha$ plays a dominant role in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Critical Role of LIGO-India in the Era of Next-Generation Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy, driven by gravitational-wave observations, is a rapidly evolving field poised for significant advancements over the next decade. This paper examines the role of the upcoming LIGO-India detector in enhancing multi-messenger efforts by comparing ten network configurations using key metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sky localization area ($\Delta \Omega_{90}$), and the precision of astrophysical parameter measurements. Our results show that a network with two L-shaped Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) performs best, detecting nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger population ($\sim$ 16,000 events) up to a redshift of 0.5 with SNR $\geq 10$, and localizing over 10,000 events within $10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 146 events within $0.1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$. It also detects over 9,000 events with relative luminosity distance errors $\Delta D_L / D_L &lt; 0.1$, including 110 events with sub-percent errors in $D_L$. Notably, replacing the 20 km CE detector with LIGO-India retains comparable performance, achieving a similar number of detections and localization of over 9,000 events within $10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 86 events within $\Delta \Omega_{90} \leq 0.1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$. This configuration detects over 5,700 events with luminosity distance errors under 10%, including 55 events with under 1% error in $D_L$. Both networks are capable of detecting $\mathcal{O}(100)$ mergers up to 10 minutes pre-merger with localization areas $\leq 10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, significantly outperforming a network of two CE detectors and LIGO-Livingston. Our findings highlight LIGO-India's potential to improve source localization and extend early warning times, which is critical for advancing multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Numerical gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops from simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of performing computational gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops taken from a network simulation. The principal effect of backreaction is to smooth out small-scale structure on loops, which we demonstrate by various measures including the average loop power spectrum and the distribution of kink angles on the loops. Backreaction does lead to self-intersections in most cases, but these are typically small. An important effect discussed in prior work is the rounding off of kinks to form cusps, but we find that the cusps produced by that process are very weak and do not significantly contribute to the total gravitational-wave radiation of the loop. We comment briefly on extrapolating our results to loops as they would be found in nature.</description>

      <title>Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft attitude or the Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of around 30 nrad and frequencies near 43 mHz are practical and nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with precision below 15 um/rad (1-sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that can be achieved without using maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>The stress-energy tensor of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Early Universe Cosmology on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Does the stability of f(R) theories implies the stability of the dual scalar-tensor theory ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher curvature f(R) gravity theories are often plagued with Ostragadsky instability. In this work we show that such instability manifests itself in the corresponding dual scalar tensor theory in the scalar sector Lagrangian. We explicitly demonstrate the correspondence between the instabilities that appear in an $f(R)$ model and its corresponding scalar tensor theory. Considering various forms of f(R) gravity this feature is illustrated for different choices of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.
  Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.
  Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.
  Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Classes in Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By viewing black hole solutions as topological defects in thermodynamic parameter space, we unveil a novel topological class and two new topological subclasses, respectively denoted $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, $\overline{W}^{1+}$, and $\hat{W}^{1+}$, that extend beyond the four established categories proposed by Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)]. Within the newly identified class and these two novel subclasses, the innermost small black hole states exhibit a distinct sequence of unstable, stable, and stable behaviours, while the outermost large black hole states display a uniform pattern of stable behaviours. These classifications indicate thermodynamic properties in both the low and high Hawking temperature regimes that are strikingly different from the previously known four topological classes. In particular, we demonstrate that static charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravity exhibit an intricate thermodynamic evolution that is notably distinct from that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole. From a topological perspective, we emphasize the advantages and potential of investigating thermodynamic phase transitions in these black holes, an area that has been rarely explored in previous research. Our findings not only enrich and sharpen the framework of topological classifications in black hole thermodynamics, but also represent a significant stride toward unraveling the fundamental nature of black holes and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We identify half-wormhole contributions to the non averaged $\mathscr{N} =1$ supersymmetric SYK model in which time has been reduced to a point. As in previously studied examples, the inclusion of half-wormholes restores factorisation in the large $N$ limit. Wormholes as well as half-wormholes break supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Holographic striped superconductor with ionic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model to study the striped superconductor on ionic lattices. This model features a phase diagram with three distinct phases, namely the charge density wave (CDW) phase, ordinary superconducting phase (SC) and the striped superconducting phase (SSC). The effect of the ionic lattices on the phase diagram is investigated in detail. First, due to the periodic nature of the background, different types of CDW solutions can be found below the critical temperature. Furthermore, with the increase of the lattice amplitude these solutions are locked in different commensurate states. Second, we find that the critical temperature of CDW phase decreases with the increase of the lattice amplitude, while that of the SC phase increases. Additionally, the background solutions are obtained for different phases, and it is verified that the SSC phase has the lowest free energy among all three phases.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in curvature perturbation power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the ``double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large when the transition from the USR phase to the final attractor phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against the loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamics of the black holes of the Cano-Ruip\'erez 4-dimensional string effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cano-Ruip\'erez 4-dimensional string effective action is the simplest consistent truncation of the first-order in $\alpha'$ heterotic string effective action compactified on T$^{6}$. This theory contains, on top of the metric, a dilaton and an axion that couple to the Gauss-Bonnet term and to the Pontrjagin density which suggests a very strong relation between the physical and geometrical properties of its solutions. In this paper we study the thermodynamics of the string black-hole solutions of this theory using Wald's formalism. We construct the on-shell closed generalized Komar, dilaton and axion 2-form charges, and we used them to find the Smarr formula (that we test on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions) and to prove no-(primary)-hair theorems for the scalar. We find that $\alpha'$ plays the role of a thermodynamical variable with an associated chemical potential. We also notice the occurrence of non-standard gravitational charges in the Wald entropy and scalar charges.</description>

      <title>A fully precessing higher-mode surrogate model of effective-one-body waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a surrogate model of \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM}, a fully precessing time-domain effective-one-body waveform model including subdominant modes. We follow an approach similar to that used to build recent numerical relativity surrogate models. Our surrogate is 5000M in duration, covers mass-ratios up to 1:20 and dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.8. Validating the surrogate against an independent test set we find that the bulk of the surrogate errors is less than $\sim 1\%$ in mismatch, which is similar to the modelling error of \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} itself. At high total mass a few percent of configurations can exceed this threshold if they are highly precessing and they exceed a mass-ratio of 1:4. This surrogate is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the underlying time-domain \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} model and can be evaluated in $\sim 50$ ms. Bayesian inference analyses with \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} are typically very computationally demanding and can take from weeks to months to complete. The two order of magnitude speedup attained by our surrogate model enables practical parameter estimation analyses with this waveform family. This is \emph{crucial} because Bayesian inference allows us to recover the masses and spins of binary black hole mergers given a model of the emitted gravitational waveform along with a description of the noise.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Fiducial Structures in Minisuperspace Reduction and Quantum Fluctuations in LQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spatially non-compact minisuperpace models, spatial integrals in the Hamiltonian and symplectic form must be regularised by confining them to a finite volume $V_o$, known as the fiducial cell. As this restriction is unnecessary in the complete theory before homogeneous reduction, the physical significance of the fiducial cell has been largely debated, especially in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Understanding its role is in turn essential for assessing the minisuperspace description's validity and its connection to the full theory. In this work we present a systematic procedure for reduction to spatially homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspaces within the canonical framework and apply it to a massive scalar field theory and gravity. Our strategy consists in implementing spatial homogeneity via second-class constraints for discrete field modes over a partitioning of the spatial slice into countably many disjoint cells. The reduced theory's canonical structure is then given by the corresponding Dirac bracket. Importantly, the latter can only be defined on a finite number of cells patched together. This identifies a finite region, the fiducial cell, whose physical size acquires then a precise meaning already at the classical level as the scale over which homogenenity is imposed. Additionally, the procedure allows to track the information lost during reduction and how the error depends on $V_o$. We then move to the quantisation of the classically reduced theories, focusing on the relation between theories for different $V_o$, and study the implications for statistical moments, quantum fluctuations, and semiclassical states. In the case of a quantum scalar field, a subsector of the full quantum field theory where the results from the "first reduced, then quantised" approach can be reproduced is identified and the conditions for this to be a good approximation are also determined.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of Penrose diagrams for black hole to white hole transition with spacelike thin shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explicitly construct the coordinates associated with the Penrose diagram in spacetimes connected via a spacelike thin shell in the following two examples: the generalized black-to-white hole bounce with mass difference and the Schwarzschild-to-de Sitter transition. We point out the issue of the first junction condition in the Penrose diagram constructed by cutting and pasting analytically known metrics with spherical symmetry by a static spacelike thin shell. With the goal of a global conformal coordinate chart associated with the corresponding Penrose diagram without discontinuity at the thin shell, we give a procedure consisting of three conformal transformations that serve different purposes. The first two of them are used to generate a continuous coordinate patch covering the entire thin shell, and therefore, the Penrose diagram can be constructed properly by patches with overlapping. The third transformation removes any coordinate singularity reintroduced by the first two transformations at the event horizons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction in Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A coupling prescription for post-Newtonian corrections in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum theory and general relativity remains one of the main challenges of modern physics. A renewed interest in the low-energy limit is driven by the prospect of new experiments that could probe this interface. Here we develop a covariant framework for expressing post-Newtonian corrections to Schr\"odinger's equation on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds based on a $1/c^2$ expansion of Lorentzian geometry, where $c$ is the speed of light. Our framework provides a generic coupling prescription of quantum systems to gravity that is valid in the intermediate regime between Newtonian gravity and General Relativity, and that retains the focus on geometry. At each order in $1/c^2$ this produces a nonrelativistic geometry to which quantum systems at that order couple. By considering the gauge symmetries of both the nonrelativistic geometries and the $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon field, we devise a prescription that allows us to derive the Schr\"odinger equation and its post-Newtonian corrections on a gravitational background order-by-order in $1/c^2$. We also demonstrate that these results can be obtained from a $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon Lagrangian. We illustrate our methods by performing the $1/c^2$ expansion of the Kerr metric up to $\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$, which leads to a special case of the Hartle--Thorne metric. The associated Schr\"odinger equation captures novel and potentially measurable effects.</description>

Abstract: We describe a simple and efficient Python code to perform Bayesian forecasting for gravitational waves (GW) produced by Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral systems (EMRIs). The code runs on GPUs for an efficient parallelised computation of thousands of waveforms and sampling of the posterior through a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. EMRI_MC generates EMRI waveforms based on the so--called kludge scheme, and propagates it to the observer accounting for cosmological effects in the observed waveform due to modified gravity/dark energy. The code provides a helpful resource for forecasts for interferometry missions in the milli-Hz scale, e.g the satellite-mission LISA.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible relationship between the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and the universe's quantum complexity can be established in the context of a new proposal for quantum gravity, according to which spacetime must emerge from quantum correlations without correlata. Such a bridge between $H_{0}$ and the universe's complexity can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart and Gong and extended by Auclair and Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum fully expanded around a pivot scale up to N3LO, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectra of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to the effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation in metric variables. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_\ast$. Surprisingly, we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_\ast = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation and a prediction of a negative running $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=-\frac{1}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2+\ldots$ of the scalar tilt. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>

Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? We study a low-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles are stable particles can comprise a measurable part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the Square Kilometer Array. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula, which can work if dark matter is collisional, so interacting dark matter. Without specifying a model for interacting dark matter, thus choosing an agnostic approach for interacting dark matter, we assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by interacting dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect.</description>

      <title>Fiber Optics in Curved Space-Times</title>

Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as Standard Candles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a thriving field in astronomy and cosmology. Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the literature, the dispersion measure (DM) of FRB has been considered extensively. It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB. The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$ directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration and the cosmological constraints. Notice that the results are speculative, since they are based on simulations for the future (instead of now). We stress that the point in the present work is just to propose a viable method and a workable pipeline using type Ib FRBs as standard candles for cosmology in the future.</description>

Abstract: In odd dimensions, we prove a scalar curvature rigidity for parabolic convex polytopes in hyperbolic space enclosed by linear planes in the Poincare upper half-space model and convex with respect to the conformally related flat metric. Our method is based on spinor techniques and relies on the recent smoothing constructions of Brendle-Wang. We also prove a Llarull type rigidity for bounded smooth parabolic convex domains and a dihedral rigidity for polytopal initial data sets with dominant energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stochastic Template Bank using Inner Product Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources like neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ for eccentric and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Astrophysical Priors on Parameter Inference for GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\,M_{\odot}$and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio. However, there is no evidence that the black hole was tidally spun up.</description>

      <title>Rates and beaming angles of GRBs associated with compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some, if not all, binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and a fraction of neutron - star black hole (NSBH) mergers, are thought to produce sufficient mass-ejection to power Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, this fraction, as well as the distribution of beaming angles of BNS-associated GRBs, are poorly constrained from observation. Recent work applied machine learning tools to analyze GRB light curves observed by {\textit{Fermi}}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT. GRBs were segregated into multiple distinct clusters, with the tantalizing possibility that one of them (BNS cluster) could be associated with BNSs and another (NSBH cluster) with NSBHs. As a proof of principle, assuming that all GRBs detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT associated with BNSs (NSBHs) lie in the BNS (NSBH) cluster, we estimate their rates ($\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). We compare these rates with corresponding BNS and NSBH rates estimated by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration from the first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3). We find that the BNS rates are consistent with LVK's rate estimates, assuming a uniform distribution of beaming fractions ($f_b \in [0.01, 0.1]$). Conversely, using the LVK's BNS rate estimates, assuming all BNS mergers produce GRBs, we are able to constrain the beaming angle distribution to $\theta_j \in [0.8^{\circ}, 33.5^{\circ}]$ at $90\%$ confidence. We similarly place limits on the fraction of GRB-Bright NSBHs as $f_B \in [1.3\%, 63\%]$ ($f_B \in [0.4\%, 15\%]$) with {\it Fermi}/GBM ({\it Swift}/BAT) data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>Quintessential early dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. But, at the perturbation level the potential shows significant difference with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. Even after the presence of required EDE solution in all four potentials we don't get any significant improvement in the value of $H_0$. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also see that the data prefers $\Lambda$CDM model over the considered scalar field models at least for the data combinations with Pantheon$+$ and Union3.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations), In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>
