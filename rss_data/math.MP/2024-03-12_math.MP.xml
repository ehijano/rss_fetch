      <title>Elliptic analogue of Vershik-Kerov limit shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the limit shape problem for the Plancherel measure and its generalizations found in supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. We focus on the measure, interpolating between the Plancherel measure and uniform measure, a U(1) case of N=2* gauge theory. We give the formula for its limit shape in terms of elliptic functions, generalizing the trigonometric ``arcsin'' law of Vershik-Kerov and Logan-Schepp.</description>

      <title>From the Fokker-Planck equation to a contact Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation is one of the fundamental equations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and this equation is known to be derived from the Wasserstein gradient flow equation with a free energy. This gradient flow equation describes relaxation processes and is formulated on Riemannian manifolds. Meanwhile contact Hamiltonian systems are also known to describe relaxation processes. Hence a relation between these two equations is expected to be clarified, which gives a solid foundation in geometric statistical mechanics. In this paper a class of contact Hamiltonian systems is derived from a class of the Fokker-Planck equations on Riemannian manifolds. In the course of the derivation, the Fokker-Planck equation is shown to be written as a diffusion equation with a weighted Laplacian without any approximation, which enables to employ a theory of eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to rational and soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $N$-electron Hamiltonian $H(N, Z)$ with the total nuclear charge $Z$ has no normalizable ground state if the ground state energy $E(N, Z)$ satisfies $E(N, Z)= E(N-1, Z)$ for $Z=N-1$. For anions $\mathrm{He}^-, \mathrm{Be}^-, \mathrm{N}^-, \mathrm{Ne}^-$, etc., many numerical results give strong evidence of the condition $E(N, Z)= E(N-1, Z)$.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics of Feynman-Kac path integral kernel functions in terms of branching diffusion processes with killing. This sheds new light on the admissible path-wise description of the relaxation to equilibrium for conditioned Brownian motions, and diffusion processes with absorbing boundaries, where Feynman-Kac kernels appear as the building blocks of inferred transition probability density functions.</description>

      <title>Stationary phase analysis of ambient noise cross-correlations: Focusing on non-ballistic arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked cross-correlation functions have become ubiquitous in the ambient seismic imaging and monitoring community as approximations to the Green's function between two receivers. While theoretical understanding of this approximation to the ballistic arrivals is well established, the equivalent analysis for the non-ballistic arrivals is alarmingly inadequate compared to the exponential growth of its applications. To provide a fundamental understanding of the cross-correlation functions beyond the ballistic arrivals, we derive analytical stationary phase solutions for ambient noise cross-correlations with a focus on non-ballistic arrivals. We establish the mathematical and corresponding physical conditions that drastically differentiate the non-ballistic arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation and the actual Green's functions. In ambient noise environments, the coda waves due to random medium scatterings of an impulsive source cannot be distinguished from the cross-talk artifacts due to overlapping random noise sources. Therefore, changes in the non-ballistic arrivals cannot be uniquely attributed to changes in the medium or changes in the noise source environment without additional constraints. The theoretical results demand that interpreting large-elapse-time arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation functions as coda waves for deterministic information about the propagation medium should be conducted only after the source influence is sufficiently ruled out. Once the source influence is eliminated, the stationary phase solutions for scattering waves provide a solid basis for extracting reliable scattering information from the noise correlation functions for higher-resolution imaging and monitoring.</description>

      <title>A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M = o(N^{1/10})$. Allowing for a $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayesian-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d. entries the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M = 1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the Gaussian vector channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of homomorphisms among unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <title>Phases and Duality in Fundamental Kazakov-Migdal Model on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Sobolev norms of solutions to time dependent Schr\"odinger equations for $d$-dimensional $N$-partcles interacting via time dependent two body potentials are bounded in time if certain Lebesgue norms of the potentials are small uniformly in time. The proof uses the scattering theory in the extended phase space which proves that all particles scatter freely in the remote past and far future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomalies for (maximal) 6d conformal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with a sample size of a thousand million.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp. TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the ``no observer horizon'' conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a detailed computational framework designed to analyze and forecast the complex multiphase characteristics of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are essential for developing sustainable technological advancements. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have a significant thermo-electromechanical response, although their electromechanical characteristics vary throughout different phases of the material. Lead-free piezoelectric materials undergo phase changes, including rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases, when the temperature changes. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, multiple phases exist simultaneously under certain temperature, electrical, and mechanical conditions, resulting in the material displaying intricate multiphase behavior. Studying such behaviour is crucial for evaluating the performance of these materials. The computational approach in this research relies on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to model micro-domain phase changes in the material. This research will enhance our comprehension of the significance of complex multiphase behaviour in creating environment-friendly and sustainable technological solutions.</description>

      <title>Parity questions in critical planar Brownian loop-soups (or "where did the free planar bosons go?")</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup is an infinite collection of non-interacting Brownian loops in a planar domain that possesses some combinatorial features related to the notion of indistinguishability of bosons. The properly renormalized occupation time field of this collection of loops is known to be distributed like the properly defined square of a Gaussian free field. In the present paper, we investigate aspects of the question about how much information these fields provide about the loop-soup. Among other things, we show that the exact set of points that are actually visited by some loops in the loop-soup is not determined by these fields. We further prove that given the fields, a dense family of special points will each have a conditional probability 1/2 of being part of the loop-soup. We also exhibit another instance where the possible decompositions (given the field) into individual loops and excursions can be grouped into two clearly different groups, each having a conditional probability 1/2 of occurring.</description>

      <title>Invariant Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have emerged as a prominent new method for solving differential equations. While conceptually straightforward, they often suffer training difficulties that lead to relatively large discretization errors or the failure to obtain correct solutions. In this paper we introduce invariant physics-informed neural networks for ordinary differential equations that admit a finite-dimensional group of Lie point symmetries. Using the method of equivariant moving frames, a differential equation is invariantized to obtain a, generally, simpler equation in the space of differential invariants. A solution to the invariantized equation is then mapped back to a solution of the original differential equation by solving the reconstruction equations for the left moving frame. The invariantized differential equation together with the reconstruction equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network, and form what we call an invariant physics-informed neural network. We illustrate the method with several examples, all of which considerably outperform standard non-invariant physics-informed neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an $n$-qubit system, a rational function on the space of mixed states which is invariant with respect to the action of the group of local symmetries may be viewed as a detailed measure of entanglement. We show that the field of all such invariant rational functions is purely transcendental over the complex numbers and has transcendence degree $4^n - 2n-1$. An explicit transcendence basis is also exhibited.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium symmetry-protected topological order: emergence of semilocal Gibbs ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonequilibrium time evolution in quantum spin chains after a global quench. Usually a nonequilibium quantum many-body system locally relaxes to a (generalised) Gibbs ensemble built from conserved operators with quasilocal densities. Here we exhibit explicit examples of local Hamiltonians that possess conservation laws with densities that are not quasilocal but act as such in the symmetry-restricted space where time evolution occurs. Because of them, the stationary state emerging at infinite time can exhibit exceptional features. We focus on a specific example with a spin-flip symmetry, which is the commonest global symmetry encountered in spin-$1/2$ chains. Among the exceptional properties, we find that, at late times, the excess of entropy of a spin block triggered by a local perturbation in the initial state grows logarithmically with the subsystem's length. We establish a connection with symmetry-protected topological order in equilibrium at zero temperature and study the melting of the order induced either by a (symmetry-breaking) rotation of the initial state or by an increase of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Existence of a percolation threshold on finite transitive graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)$ be a sequence of finite connected vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)$ is a percolation threshold if for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the proportion $\left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert$ of vertices contained in the largest cluster under bond percolation $\mathbb{P}_p^G$ satisfies both \[ \begin{split}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1+\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 1 \quad \text{for some $\alpha &gt; 0$, and}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 0 \quad \text{for all $\alpha &gt; 0$}. \end{split}\] We prove that $(G_n)$ has a percolation threshold if and only if $(G_n)$ does not contain a particular infinite collection of pathological subsequences of dense graphs. Our argument uses an adaptation of Vanneuville's new proof of the sharpness of the phase transition for infinite graphs via couplings [Van22] together with our recent work with Hutchcroft on the uniqueness of the giant cluster [EH21].</description>

Abstract: We systematically develop the Hilbert series technique for counting independent operators in Effective Field Theories. In the hope of providing more approachable entry point to the subject we include a detailed introduction of all necessary group theoretic tools (in a rather mathematical definition-theorem-proof style). Finally, we apply the formalism in the case of a single scalar field and also electromagnetic field, partly reproducing and partly extending known results.</description>

      <title>Algebraic discrete quantum harmonic oscillator with dynamic resolution scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic formulation for the discrete quantum harmonic oscillator (DQHO) with a finite, equally-spaced energy spectrum and energy eigenfunctions defined on a discrete domain, which is known as the su(2) or Kravchuk oscillator. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not depend on the discretization of the Schr\"odinger equation and recurrence relations of special functions. This algebraic formulation is endowed with a natural su(2) algebra, each finite dimensional irreducible representation of which defines a distinct DQHO labeled by its resolution. In addition to energy ladder operators, the formulation allows for resolution ladder operators connecting all DQHOs with different resolutions. The resolution ladder operators thus enable the dynamic scaling of the resolution of finite degree-of-freedom quantum simulations. Using the algebraic DQHO formalism, we are able to rigorously derive the energy eigenstate wave functions of the QHO in a purely algebraic manner without using differential equations or differential operators, which is impossible in the continuous or infinite discrete setting. The coherent state of the DQHO is constructed, and its expected position is proven to oscillate as a classical harmonic oscillator. The DQHO coherent state recovers that of the quantum harmonic oscillator at large resolution. The algebraic formulation also predicts the existence of an inverse DQHO that has no known continuous counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We study the stationary fluctuations of independent run-and-tumble particles. We prove that the joint densities of particles with given internal state converges to an infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also consider an interacting case, where the particles are subjected to exclusion. We then study the fluctuations of the total density, which is a non-Markovian Gaussian process, and obtain its covariance in closed form. By considering small noise limits of this non-Markovian Gaussian process, we obtain in a concrete example a large deviation rate function containing memory terms.</description>

      <title>The phase transition for the Gaussian free field is sharp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the phase transition for the Gaussian free field (GFF) is sharp. In comparison to a previous argument due to Rodriguez in 2017 which characterized a $0-1$ law for the Massive Gaussian Free Field by analyzing crossing probabilities below a threshold $h_{**}$, we implement a strategy due to Duminil-Copin and Manolescu in 2016, which establishes that two parameters are equal, one of which encapsulates the probability of obtaining an infinite connected component under free boundary conditions, while the other encapsulates the natural logarithm of the probability of obtaining a connected component from the origin to the box of length $n$ which is also taken under free boundary conditions. We quantify the probability of obtaining crossings in easy and hard directions, without imposing conditions that the graph is invariant with respect to reflections, in addition to making use of a differential inequality adapted for the GFF. The sharpness of the phase transition is characterized by the fact that below a certain height parameter of the GFF, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster a.s. decays exponentially fast, while above the parameter, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster occurs a.s. with good probability.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of large order relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main applications of resurgence in physics is the decoding of nonperturbative effects through large order relations. These relations connect perturbative asymptotic expansions of observables to expansions around other saddle points. Together, this data is unified in transseries that describe the nonperturbative structure. It is known that large order relations themselves also take the form of transseries. We study these large order transseries, uncover an interesting underlying geometry that we call the `Borel cylinder', and show that large order transseries in turn are resurgent -- that is: their nonperturbative sectors `know about each other' through Borel residues that are essentially equal to those of the original transseries. We show that with an appropriate resummation prescription, large order relations are often exact: they can be used to exactly compute perturbative coefficients -- not just their large order growth. Finally, we argue that Stokes phenomenon plays an important role for large order relations, for example if we want to extend the discrete index of the perturbative coefficients to arbitrary complex values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple fixed-point iterative algorithm that computes the matrix projection with respect to the Bures distance on the set of positive definite matrices that are invariant under some symmetry. We prove that the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution in the number of iterations. Moreover, it numerically shows fast convergence compared to the off-the-shelf semidefinite program solvers. Our algorithm, for the specific case of matrix barycenters, recovers the fixed-point iterative algorithm originally introduced in (\'Alvarez-Esteban et al., 2016). Compared to previous works, our proof is more general and direct as it is based only on simple matrix inequalities. Finally, we discuss several applications of our algorithm in quantum resource theories and quantum Shannon theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth map $g\colon X \to U(N)$, where $X$ is a three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number or the map's degree is defined by $W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]$. We introduce a method to compute $W_3$ using a discrete approximation of $X$ so that the result is manifestly quantized.</description>
