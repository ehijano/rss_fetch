      <title>Semi-Supervised Radiomics for Glioblastoma IDH Mutation: Limited Labels, Data Sensitivity, and SHAP Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor in which IDH mutation status is a key prognostic biomarker, but traditional testing requires invasive biopsies, emphasizing the need for non-invasive approaches. In this multi-center study, we analyzed MRI sequences (T1, T2-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1, and FLAIR) from 1,329 patients across eight centers, with IDH labels available for 1,061 cases. A total of 1,223 radiomic features per case were extracted using PyRadiomics with Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters, and both supervised learning (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks were applied, incorporating 38 feature selection/attribute extraction strategies and 24 classifiers. Five-fold cross-validation was performed on UCSF-PDGM and UPENN datasets, and external validation on IvyGAP, TCGA-LGG, and TCGA-GBM, with SHAP analysis conducted for feature interpretability. Multimodal MRI fusion (T1+T2+T1CE+FLAIR) consistently outperformed single-sequence models. The best SSL model (RFE + SVM) achieved 0.93 cross-validation and 0.75 external accuracy, while the top SL model (RFE + Complement Naive Bayes) reached 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. SSL further demonstrated greater robustness to limited sample sizes, maintaining stable performance compared to SL, and SHAP analysis highlighted the amplified role of first-order Root Mean Square (T1CE) and wavelet-based features, strengthening biomarker interpretability. These findings indicate that SSL enhances accuracy, stability, and interpretability in MRI-based IDH prediction, with multimodal MRI fusion providing the most scalable and reliable strategy for non-invasive biomarker discovery in GBM.</description>

      <title>Millennium Pathways for Tractography: 40 grand challenges to shape the future of tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of the historic Millennium Prize Problems that heralded a new era for mathematics, the newly formed International Society for Tractography (IST) has launched the Millennium Pathways for Tractography, a community-driven roadmap designed to shape the future of the field. Conceived during the inaugural Tract-Anat Retreat, this initiative reflects a collective vision for advancing tractography over the coming decade and beyond. The roadmap consists of 40 grand challenges, developed by international experts and organized into seven categories spanning three overarching themes: neuroanatomy, tractography methods, and clinical applications. By defining shared short-, medium-, and long-term goals, these pathways provide a structured framework to confront fundamental limitations, promote rigorous validation, and accelerate the translation of tractography into a robust tool for neuroscience and medicine. Ultimately, the Millennium Pathways aim to guide and inspire future research and collaboration, ensuring the continued scientific and clinical relevance of tractography well into the future.</description>

      <title>Investigating time- and orientation-dependent transverse relaxation from magnetic susceptibility of white matter microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive the dependence of the transverse relaxation rate on the angle between axons and the external field and show through simulations that the time-dependence signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be undetectable at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers for diseased tissue.</description>

      <title>Real-time gait event detection using motion capture to control an electrical stimulator: Proof-of-concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent motor disorder in childhood and often results in gait abnormalities that hinder mobility and diminish quality of life. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has demonstrated potential in enhancing gait in individuals in this population, however, its practical implementation remains complex, as it requires monitoring various gait parameters and delivering personalized stimulation to different muscles in order to correct various gait impairments. Recent advancements in real-time motion capture (MOCAP) and wearable sensors now enable the development of closed-loop, multi-channel FES systems. This study will assess the feasibility and responsiveness of a real-time, event-triggered multi-channel stimulation protocol during treadmill walking. The stimulation is triggered by specific gait events (heel strike, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion) detected through the MOCAP system and administered via a multichannel electrical stimulator. Conducted on healthy adults, this preliminary study focuses on assessing technical feasibility. We report different technical outcomes including the latency between gait event detection and the appearance of stimulation artifacts in EMG signals. The results confirm the viability of the system, laying the groundwork for future clinical application in the rehabilitation of children with CP.</description>

      <title>A solution to the mystery of the sub-harmonic series and to the combination tone via a linear mathematical model of the cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Driven Spike Encoding for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodynamic behavior of artificial neuron circuits made of Mott memristors provides versatile opportunities to utilize them for artificial sensing. Their small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the nervous system.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T remains a technical challenge due to field inhomogeneity and prolonged T1 values. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate and clinically applicable myocardial T1 mapping technique for 5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and validate its performance in a multicenter study. Methods: The proposed method is based on a 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence, dubbed combined-correction MOLLI (coMOLLI), which corrects for both inversion efficiency and readout-induced signal disturbances. Specifically, coMOLLI employs a gradient recalled echo (GRE) readout rather than the commonly used bSSFP readout. Its signal evolution is modeled to estimate T1 values, which incorporates both inversion efficiency and readout disturbances to improve fitting accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, the inversion pulse was redesigned under hardware constraints and the observed B0 and B1 variations over the heart at 5T, using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. The method was validated in phantom experiments, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients. Results: The optimized inversion pulse at 5T is the Tan/Tanh pulse with A = 10 kHz, K_s = 4, k = 22, and T_p = 8 ms. In phantom studies, coMOLLI showed high accuracy versus reference IR-FSE, yielding relative errors within 5% for all nine vials. In vivo studies, the average native myocardial T1 values across 21 healthy volunteers were 1468 +/- 48 ms, 1514 +/- 39 ms, and 1545 +/- 50 ms, and blood T1 values were 2182 +/- 132 ms, 2124 +/- 153 ms, and 2131 +/- 158 ms for apical, middle, and base slices, respectively. Conclusion: The coMOLLI method demonstrated high accuracy in phantom studies and feasibility in vivo studies. By adopting the widely used 5-(3)-3 MOLLI acquisition scheme, it shows potential for clinical cardiac imaging at 5T.</description>
