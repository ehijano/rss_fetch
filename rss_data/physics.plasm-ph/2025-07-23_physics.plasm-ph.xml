      <title>Efficient dataset construction using active learning and uncertainty-aware neural networks for plasma turbulent transport surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a proof-of-principle for using uncertainty-aware architectures, in combination with active learning techniques and an in-the-loop physics simulation code as a data labeller, to construct efficient datasets for data-driven surrogate model generation. Building off of a previous proof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static pre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied again to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas, specifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent transport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study specifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive codes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP architecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP architecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\Gamma_e$, $\Gamma_i$, and $\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45 active learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of $10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$ classification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75 on an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching the same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on a problem with 1 extra input dimension. While the improvement rate achieved in this implementation diminishes faster than expected, the overall technique is formulated with components that can be upgraded and generalized to many surrogate modeling applications beyond plasma turbulent transport predictions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Hydrodynamic Simulations for Laser Direct-drive Implosion Experiments via Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents predictive hydrodynamic simulations empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) for laser driven implosion experiments, taking the double-cone ignition (DCI) scheme as an example. A Transformer-based deep learning model MULTI-Net is established to predict implosion features according to laser waveforms and target radius. A Physics-Informed Decoder (PID) is proposed for high-dimensional sampling, significantly reducing the prediction errors compared to Latin hypercube sampling. Applied to DCI experiments conducted on the SG-II Upgrade facility, the MULTI-Net model is able to predict the implosion dynamics measured by the x-ray streak camera. It is found that an effective laser absorption factor about 65\% is suitable for the one-dimensional simulations of the DCI-R10 experiments. For shot 33, the mean implosion velocity and collided plasma density reached 195 km/s and 117 g/cc, respectively. This study demonstrates a data-driven AI framework that enhances the prediction ability of simulations for complicated laser fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for High-Precision Grad-Shafranov Equilibrium Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium reconstruction of plasma is a core step in real-time diagnostic tasks in fusion research. This paper explores a multi-stage Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs) approach to solve the Grad-Shafranov equation, achieving high-precision solutions with an error magnitude of $O(10^{-8})$ between the output of the second-stage neural network and the analytical solution. Our results demonstrate that the multi-stage PINNs provides a reliable tool for plasma equilibrium reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Scalable Chrysopoeia via $(n, 2n)$ Reactions Driven by Deuterium-Tritium Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalable approach for chrysopoeia - the transmutation of base metals into gold - has been pursued for millennia. While there have been small-scale demonstrations in particle accelerators and proposals involving thermal neutron capture, no economically attractive approach has yet been identified. We show a new scalable method to synthesize stable gold $\left( \mathrm{^{197}Au} \right)$ from the abundant mercury isotope $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ using $(n, 2n)$ reactions in a specialized neutron multiplier layer of a fusion blanket. Reactions are driven by fast $14\, \mathrm{MeV}$ neutrons provided by a deuterium-tritium fusion plasma, which are uniquely capable of enabling the desired reaction pathway at scale. Crucially, the scheme identified here does not negatively impact electricity production, and is also compatible with the challenging tritium breeding requirements of fusion power plant design because $(n, 2n)$ reactions of $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ drive both transmutation and neutron multiplication. Using neutronics simulations, we demonstrate a tokamak with a blanket configuration that can produce $\mathrm{^{197}Au}$ at a rate of about 2t/$\mathrm{GW_{th}}$/yr. Implementation of this concept allows fusion power plants to double the revenue generated by the system, dramatically enhancing the economic viability of fusion energy.</description>
