      <title>Multi-patch/multiple-scattering frequency-time hybrid solver for interior and exterior wave equation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new multiple-scattering frequency-time hybrid (FTH-MS) integral equation solver for problems of wave scattering by obstacles in two dimensional space, including interior problems in closed cavities and problems exterior to a set of disconnected open or closed scattering obstacles. The multiple-scattering FTH-MS method is based on a partition of the domain boundary into a user-prescribed set of overlapping open arcs, along with a corresponding sequence of multiple-scattering problems that effectively decompose the interior problem into a series of open-arc wave equation subproblems. The new strategy provides a significant extension of the original FTH-MS algorithm originally presented in [22], in that (1) By allowing for use of an arbitrary of number of component arcs, and not just two as in the previous contribution, the new approach affords (1a) A significantly increased geometric flexibility, as well as, (1b) The use of partitions for which each open arc leads to small numbers of iterations if iterative linear-algebra solvers are employed; and, (2) It facilitates parallelization -- as the subproblem solutions that are needed at each multiple scattering step can be evaluated in an embarrassingly parallel fashion. Utilizing a suitably-implemented Fourier transformation, each sub-problem is reduced to a Helmholtz frequency-domain problem that is tackled via a uniquely-solvable boundary integral equation. Similar FTH-MS methods are also presented for problems exterior to a number of bounded obstacles. All of the algorithms considered incorporate the previously introduced ``time-windowing and recentering'' methodology (that enables both treatment of incident signals of long duration and long time simulation), as well as a high-frequency Fourier transform algorithm that delivers numerically dispersionless, spectrally-accurate time evolution for arbitrarily long times.</description>

      <title>A direct PinT algorithm for higher-order nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly studies a direct time-parallel algorithm for solving time-dependent differential equations of order 1 to 3. Different from the traditional time-stepping approach, we directly solve the all-at-once system from higher-order evolution equations by diagonalization the time discretization matrix $B$. Based on the connection between the characteristic equation and Chebyshev polynomials, we give explicit formulas for the eigenvector matrix $V$ of $B$ and its inverse $V^{-1}$ , and prove that $cond_2\left( V \right) =\mathcal{O} \left( n^3 \right)$, where $n$ is the number of time steps. A fast algorithm $B$ designed by exploring the structure of the spectral decomposition of $B$. Numerical experiments were performed to validate the acceleration performance of the fast spectral decomposition algorithm. The results show that the proposed fast algorithm achieves significant computational speedup.</description>

      <title>Regularized boundary integral equation methods for open-arc scattering problems in thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper devotes to developing novel boundary integral equation (BIE) solvers for the problem of thermoelastic scattering by open-arcs with four different boundary conditions in two dimensions. The proposed methodology is inspired by the Calder\'on formulas, whose eigenvalues are shown to accumulate at particular points depending only on Lam\'e parameters, satisfied by the thermoelastic boundary integral operators (BIOs) on both closed- and open-surfaces. Regularized BIEs in terms of weighted BIOs on open-arc that explicitly exhibits the edge singularity behavior, depending on the types of boundary conditions, of the unknown potentials are constructed to effectively reduce the required iteration number to solve the corresponding discretized linear systems. We implement the new formulations utilizing regularizations of singular integrals, which reduces the strongly- and hyper-singular integrals into weakly-singular integrals. Combined with spectrally accurate quadrature rules, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solvers.</description>

      <title>On the detection of medium inhomogeneity by contrast agent: wave scattering models and numerical implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the wave scattering and inverse scattering in an inhomogeneous medium embedded a homogeneous droplet with a small size, which is modeled by a constant mass density and a small bulk modulus. Based on the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for scattering wave in inhomogeneous medium, we firstly develop an efficient approximate scheme for computing the scattered wave as well as its far-field pattern for any droplet located in the inhomogeneous background medium. By establishing the approximate relation between the far-field patterns of the scattered wave before and after the injection of a droplet, the scattered wave of the inhomogeneous medium after injecting the droplet is represented by a measurable far-field patterns, and consequently the inhomogeneity of the medium can be reconstructed from the Helmholtz equation. Finally, the reconstruction process in terms of the dual reciprocity method is proposed to realize the numerical algorithm for recovering the bulk modulus function inside a bounded domain in three dimensional space, by moving the droplet inside the bounded domain. Numerical implementations are given using the simulation data of the far-field pattern to show the validity of the reconstruction scheme, based on the mollification scheme for dealing with the ill-posedness of this inverse problem.</description>

      <title>A nonsmooth extension of the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem via metric regularity techniques and applications to nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem, which allows to obtain existence and a priori error estimates for approximations of solutions to some nonlinear partial differential equations. Our contribution lies in the fact that we typically allow for nonlinearities having merely Lipschitz regularity, while previous results required some form of differentiability. This is achieved by making use of the theory of metrically regular mappings, developed in the context of variational analysis. We apply this generalization to derive some quasi-optimal error estimates for finite element approximations to solutions of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations and second order mean field games systems.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hessian-based error estimator for an IPDG formulation of the biharmonic problem in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two dimensional biharmonic problem and its discretization by means of a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method. Based on the ``div-div'' complex, a novel split of an error measure based on a generalized Hessian into two terms measuring the conformity and nonconformity of the scheme is proven. This splitting is the departing point for the design of a new reliable and efficient error estimator, which does not involve any DG stabilization. Such an error estimator can be bounded from above by the standard DG residual error estimator. Numerical results assess the theoretical predictions, including the efficiency of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new numerical scheme of relaxation type to approximate the Euler equations of isentropic gas dynamics on the arcs of a network. At the junction mass conservation and a jump transmission condition on the density are given, and a new solver is introduced to deal with both subsonic and supersonic cases. Consistency properties of the solver are proven and numerical tests are displayed to show its good performance also with respect to other possible solvers.</description>

      <title>The Neural Approximated Virtual Element Method for Elasticity Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Neural Approximated Virtual Element Method to numerically solve elasticity problems. This hybrid technique combines classical concepts from the Finite Element Method and the Virtual Element Method with recent advances in deep neural networks. Specifically, it is a polygonal method in which the virtual basis functions are element-wise approximated by a neural network, eliminating the need for stabilization or projection operators typical of the standard virtual element method. We present the discrete formulation of the problem and provide numerical tests on both linear and non-linear elasticity problems, demonstrating the advantages of having a simple discretization, particularly in handling non-linearities.</description>

      <title>Weak Galerkin Methods for the Brinkman Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for the numerical solution of the Brinkman equations. The Brinkman model, which seamlessly integrates characteristics of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, is employed to describe fluid flow in multiphysics contexts, particularly within heterogeneous porous media exhibiting spatially variable permeability. The proposed WG method offers a unified and robust approach capable of accurately capturing both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated regimes. A discrete inf-sup condition is established, and optimal-order error estimates are rigorously proven for the WG finite element solutions. Furthermore, a series of numerical experiments is performed to corroborate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the method's accuracy and stability in addressing the complexities inherent in the Brinkman equations.</description>

      <title>A posteriori analysis of neural network approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a general setting, we study a posteriori estimates used in finite element analysis to measure the error between a solution and its approximation. The latter is not necessarily generated by a finite element method. We show that the error is equivalent to the sum of two residuals provided that the underlying variational formulation is well posed. The first contribution is the projection of the residual to a finite-dimensional space and is therefore computable, while the second one can be reliably estimated by a computable upper bound in many practical scenarios. Assuming sufficiently accurate quadrature, our findings can be used to estimate the error of, e.g., neural network outputs. Two important applications can be considered during optimization: first, the estimators are used to monitor the error in each solver step, or, second, the two estimators are included in the loss functional, and therefore provide control over the error. As a model problem, we consider a second-order elliptic partial differential equation and discuss different variational formulations thereof, including several options to include boundary conditions in the estimators. Various numerical experiments are presented to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks for forward and inverse problems in elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06038v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network (DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enhanced Variational Regularization for Electrical Impedance Tomography via \Calderon's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to numerically solve the two-dimensional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with Cauchy data. This inverse problem is highly challenging due to its severe ill-posed nature and strong nonlinearity, which necessitates appropriate regularization strategies. Choosing a regularization approach that effectively incorporates the \textit{a priori} information of the conductivity distribution (or its contrast) is therefore essential. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method to capture the \textit{a priori} information about the shape and location of the unknown contrast using \Calderon's method. The learned \textit{a priori} information is then used to construct the regularization functional of the variational regularization method for solving the inverse problem. The resulting regularized variational problem for EIT reconstruction is then solved using the Gauss-Newton method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed inversion algorithm achieves accurate reconstruction results, even in high-contrast cases, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Additionally, some stability and convergence analysis of the variational regularization method underscores the importance of incorporating \textit{a priori} information about the support of the unknown contrast.</description>

      <title>Conservative approximation-based feedforward neural network for WENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the feedforward neural network based on the conservative approximation to the derivative from point values, for the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in solving hyperbolic conservation laws. The feedforward neural network, whose inputs are point values from the three-point stencil and outputs are two nonlinear weights, takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes, WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy comparable to WENO5-JS.</description>

      <title>Notes on $L^2$-estimates in linear elliptic equations with general coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an explicit $L^2$-estimate for weak solutions $u$ to linear elliptic equations in divergence form with general coefficients and external source term $f$, stating that the $L^2$-norm of $u$ over $U$ is bounded by a constant multiple of the $L^2$-norm of $f$ over $U$. In contrast to classical approaches based on compactness arguments, the proposed method, which employs a divergence-free transformation method, provides a computable and explicit constant $C&gt;0$. The $L^2$-estimate remains robust even when there is no zero-order term, and the analysis further demonstrates that the constant $C&gt;0$ decreases as the diffusion coefficient or the zero-order term increases. These quantitative results provide a rigorous foundation for applications such as a posteriori error estimates in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where explicit error bounds are essential.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability, that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.</description>

      <title>A Generalized $\ell_1$-Merit Function SQP Method Using Function Approximations with Tunable Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalization of the line-search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function that uses objective and constraint function approximations with tunable accuracy to solve smooth equality-constrained optimization problems. The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</description>

      <title>Stable approximation of Helmholtz solutions in the 3D ball using evanescent plane waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that evanescent plane waves are much better at numerically approximating Helmholtz solutions than classical propagative plane waves. By generalizing the Jacobi$\unicode{x2013}$Anger identity to complex-valued directions, we first prove that any solution of the Helmholtz equation on a three-dimensional ball can be written as a continuous superposition of evanescent plane waves in a stable way. We then propose a practical numerical recipe to select discrete approximation sets of evanescent plane waves, which exhibits considerable improvements over standard propagative plane wave schemes in numerical experiments. We show that all this is not possible for propagative plane waves: they cannot stably represent general Helmholtz solutions, and any approximation based on discrete sets of propagative plane waves is doomed to have exponentially large coefficients and thus to be numerically unstable. This paper is motivated by applications to Trefftz-type Galerkin schemes and extends the recent results in [Parolin, Huybrechs and Moiola, M2AN, 2023] from two to three space dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network (CFN) that integrates classical numerical conservation laws into a data-driven framework using the entropy-stable, second-order, and non-oscillatory Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) scheme. The proposed entropy-stable CFN uses slope limiting as a denoising mechanism, ensuring accurate predictions in both noisy and sparse observation environments, as well as in both smooth and discontinuous regions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the entropy-stable CFN achieves both stability and conservation while maintaining accuracy over extended time domains. Furthermore, it successfully predicts shock propagation speeds in long-term simulations, {\it without} oracle knowledge of later-time profiles in the training data.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence in finite element semi-discrete error analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model beyond 1D with a novel projection operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite element semi-discrete error analysis for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, which is the most popular model for lithium-ion batteries. Central to our approach is a novel projection operator designed for the pseudo-($N$+1)-dimensional equation, offering a powerful tool for multiscale equation analysis. Our results bridge a gap in the analysis for dimensions $2 \le N \le 3$ and achieve optimal convergence rates of $h+(\Delta r)^2$. Additionally, we perform a detailed numerical verification, marking the first such validation in this context. By avoiding the change of variables, our error analysis can also be extended beyond isothermal conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion cells. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the solution in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a novel solver that accelerates the solution process and controls memory usage. Numerical experiments with realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed solver over existing solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose higher-order isoparametric finite element approximations for mean curvature flow and surface diffusion. The methods are natural extensions of the piecewise linear finite element methods introduced by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg (BGN) in a series of papers in 2007 and 2008. The proposed schemes exhibit unconditional energy stability and inherit the favorable mesh quality of the original BGN methods. Moreover, in the case of surface diffusion we present structure-preserving higher-order isoparametric finite element methods. In addition to being unconditionally stable, these also conserve the enclosed volume. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the higher-order spatial accuracy, the unconditional energy stability, the volume preservation for surface diffusion, and the good mesh quality.</description>

      <title>A simple and general framework for the construction of exactly div-curl-grad compatible discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured simplex meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the discretization of first order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) on unstructured simplex meshes in two and three space dimensions that respect the two basic vector calculus identities exactly also at the discrete level, namely that the curl of the gradient is zero and that the divergence of the curl is zero. The key ingredient here is the construction of two compatible discrete nabla operators, a primary one and a dual one, both defined on general unstructured simplex meshes in multiple space dimensions. Our new schemes extend existing cell-centered finite volume methods based on corner fluxes to arbitrary high order of accuracy in space. An important feature of our new method is the fact that only two different discrete function spaces are needed to represent the numerical solution, and the choice of the appropriate function space for each variable is related to the origin and nature of the underlying PDE. The first class of variables is discretized at the aid of a discontinuous Galerkin approach, where the numerical solution is represented via piecewise polynomials of degree N and which are allowed to jump across element interfaces. This set of variables is related to those PDE which are mere consequences of the definitions, derived from some abstract scalar and vector potentials, and for which involutions like the divergence-free or the curl-free property must hold if satisfied by the initial data. The second class of variables is discretized via classical continuous Lagrange finite elements of approximation degree M=N+1 and is related to those PDE which can be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations of an underlying variational principle.</description>

      <title>A new Lagrange multiplier approach for constructing structure preserving schemes, III. Bound preserving and energy dissipating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the third part of this series, we continue to explore the idea of the Lagrange multiplier introduced in the first part [2020, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engr., 391, 114585] and refined in the second part [2022, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 60, 970-998] to further develop efficient and accurate numerical schemes that preserve the maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy dissipation for solving gradient flows. The proposed framework allows us to begin with any conventional scheme as a predictor step which is followed by two consecutive correction steps written in the form of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for structure preserving. The preservation of both energy dissipation and MBP and the solvability of the general resulting scheme are rigorously established. In such a framework, we implement an explicit and efficient scheme by employing the Runge-Kutta exponential time differencing scheme as the predictor step, and give its convergence analysis. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented optimal static sensor placement and dynamic sensor steering in PDE-constrained inverse problems, utilizing a Bayesian approach accelerated by low-rank approximations. The framework is applied to airborne contaminant tracking, extending recent dynamic sensor steering methods to complex geometries for computational efficiency. A C-optimal design criterion is employed to strategically place sensors, minimizing uncertainty in predictions. Numerical experiments validate the approach's effectiveness for source identification and monitoring, highlighting its potential for real-time decision-making in crisis management scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We develop and analyze a discontinuous Galerkin pressure correction scheme for the Oldroyd model of order one. The existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution as well as the consistency of the scheme are proved. The stability of the discrete velocity and pressure are established. We derive optimal $\textit{a priori}$ error bounds for the fully discrete velocity in the discontinuous discrete space. In addition, an improved error estimate for the velocity is derived in the $L^2$ norm which is optimal with respect to space and time. Furthermore, the error bound for the pressure is obtained via the estimates of discrete time derivative of the velocity. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the optimal convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta Methods: Entropy-Conservative and Entropy-Stable High-Order Optimized Multirate Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel entropy-conservative and entropy-stable multirate Runge-Kutta methods based on Paired Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes with relaxation for conservation laws and related systems of partial differential equations. Optimized schemes up to fourth-order of accuracy are derived and validated in terms of order of consistency, conservation of linear invariants, and entropy conservation/stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these P-ERRK methods when combined with a high-order, entropy-conservative/stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on unstructured meshes. The Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods(P-ERRK) are readily implemented for partitioned semidiscretizations arising from problems with equation-based scale separation such as non-uniform meshes. We highlight that the relaxation approach acts as a time-limiting technique which improves the nonlinear stability and thus robustness of the multirate schemes. The P-ERRK methods are applied to a range of problems, ranging from compressible Euler over compressible Navier-Stokes to the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in two and three spatial dimensions. For each test case, we compare computational load and runtime to standalone relaxed Runge-Kutta methods which are outperformed by factors up to four. All results can be reproduced using a publicly available repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by research in metamaterials, we consider the challenging problem of acoustic wave scattering by a doubly periodic quadrant of sound-soft scatterers arranged in a square formation, which we have dubbed the quarter lattice. This leads to a Wiener--Hopf equation in two complex variables with three unknown functions for which we can reduce and solve exactly using a new analytic method. After some suitable truncations, the resulting linear system is inverted using elementary matrix arithmetic and the solution can be numerically computed. This solution is also critically compared to a numerical least squares collocation approach and to our previous method where we decomposed the lattice into semi-infinite rows or columns.</description>
