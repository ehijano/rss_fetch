      <title>The Binary Black Hole Merger Rate Deviates From the Cosmic Star Formation Rate: A Tug of War Between Metallicity and Delay Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD) -- a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to $3.5\times$ at $z\sim0$ and $5\times$ at $z\sim 9$ due to two main phenomena: (i) The formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity; and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few Myr to many Gyr) between formation and merger. Deviations are similar when comparing to a $\textit{delayed}$ SFRD, and even larger (up to $\sim 10\times$) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift-dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of BHNSs and BNSs. We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Cosmological Rate of Compact Object Mergers from Isolated Massive Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors are observing compact object mergers from increasingly far distances, revealing the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) -- and soon the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS) -- merger rate. To help interpret these observations, we investigate the expected redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate from the isolated binary evolution channel. We present a publicly available catalog of compact object mergers and their accompanying cosmological merger rates from population synthesis simulations conducted with the COMPAS software. To explore the impact of uncertainties in stellar and binary evolution, our simulations use two-parameter grids of binary evolution models that vary the common-envelope efficiency with mass transfer accretion efficiency, and supernova remnant mass prescription with supernova natal kick velocity, respectively. We quantify the redshift evolution of our simulated merger rates using the local ($z\sim 0$) rate, the redshift at which the merger rate peaks, and the normalized differential rates (as a proxy for slope). We find that although the local rates span a range of $\sim 10^3$ across our model variations, their redshift-evolutions are remarkably similar for BBHs, BHNSs, and BNSs, with differentials typically within a factor $3$ and peaks of $z\approx 1.2-2.4$ across models. Furthermore, several trends in our simulated rates are correlated with the model parameters we explore. We conclude that future observations of the redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate can help constrain binary models for stellar evolution and gravitational-wave formation channels.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>Multi-filter UV to NIR Data-driven Light Curve Templates for Stripped Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the spectroscopic classification scheme for Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) is clear, and we know that they originate from massive stars that lost some or all their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium, the photometric evolution of classes within this family is not fully characterized. Photometric surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will discover tens of thousands of transients each night and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited, prompting the need for photometric classification and inference based solely on photometry. We have generated 54 data-driven photometric templates for SESNe of subtypes IIb, Ib, Ic, Ic-bl, and Ibn in U/u, B, g, V, R/r, I/i, J, H, Ks, and Swift w2, m2, w1 bands using Gaussian Processes and a multi-survey dataset composed of all well-sampled open-access light curves (165 SESNe, 29531 data points) from the Open Supernova Catalog. We use our new templates to assess the photometric diversity of SESNe by comparing final per-band subtype templates with each other and with individual, unusual and prototypical SESNe. We find that SNe Ibns and Ic-bl exhibit a distinctly faster rise and decline compared to other subtypes. We also evaluate the behavior of SESNe in the PLAsTiCC and ELAsTiCC simulations of LSST light curves highlighting differences that can bias photometric classification models trained on the simulated light curves. Finally, we investigate in detail the behavior of fast-evolving SESNe (including SNe Ibn) and the implications of the frequently observed presence of two peaks in their light curves.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopic and photometric classification of the X-ray transient EP240309a (EP J115415.8-501810) as an intermediate polar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on optical follow-up observations of an X-ray source initially detected by the Einstein Probe mission. Our investigations categorize the source as an intermediate polar, a class of magnetic cataclysmic variables, exhibiting an orbital period of 3.7614(4) hours and a white dwarf spin period of 3.97 minutes. The orbital period was identified through TESS observations, while our high-speed photometric data, obtained using the 1.9m and Lesedi 1.0m telescopes at the South African Astronomical Observatory, revealed both the spin and beat periods. Additionally, we present orbitally phase-resolved spectroscopic observations using the 1.9m telescope, specifically centered on the Hbeta emission line, which reveal two emission components that exhibit Doppler variations throughout the orbital cycle.</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of the Zwicky 3146 galaxy cluster reveal a 3.5 keV excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present spectral fits of the well-documented sloshing cool-core cluster Zwicky 3146 ($z=0.291$), to test the existence of the highly speculated 3.5 keV line. We report excesses at $&gt;3\sigma$ significance at $E=3.575$ keV, yielding a flux $F = 8.73_{-2.22}^{+2.17}$ $\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, in \textit{XMM-Newton}, and $E=3.55$ keV, with a flux $F = 10.0_{-2.96}^{+3.05}$ $\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in \textit{Chandra}. We explore the possibility that the 3.5 keV excess is correlated to the presence of cold gas within the cluster, based on optical and sub-mm literature analyses. Following the launch of the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), high resolution spectroscopy ($\leq 7$ eV) will reveal in unprecedented detail, the origin of this unidentified feature, for which Zwicky 3146 should be considered a viable target, due to the strength of the feature in two independent X-ray telescopes, opening a new window into plasma or charge exchange studies in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Derivation of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully and inherently relativistic derivation of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This work uses the formalism historically used to compute radiation spectra emerging from inverse Thomson/Compton sources of x-ray radiation. Comparing our results to the traditional approach based on relativistically-corrected classical Kompaneets equation, we find small, but systematic differences. Most notable are the modest (&lt; 10 %) differences in the crossover frequency where the spectral distortion due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect vanishes, and the energy increase of the distribution at high electron cloud temperatures.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en Wave Conversion to Low Frequency Fast Magnetosonic Waves in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid shear motion of magnetar crust can launch Alfv\'{e}n waves into the magnetosphere. The dissipation of the Alfv\'{e}n waves has been theorized to power the X-ray bursts characteristic of magnetars. However, the process by which Alfv\'{e}n waves convert their energy to X-rays is unclear. Recent work has suggested that energetic fast magnetosonic (fast) waves can be produced as a byproduct of Alfv\'{e}n waves propagating on curved magnetic field lines; their subsequent dissipation may power X-ray bursts. In this work, we investigate the production of fast waves by performing axisymmetric force-free simulations of Alfv\'{e}n waves propagating in a dipolar magnetosphere. For Alfv\'{e}n wave trains that do not completely fill the flux tube confining them, we find a fast wave dominated by a low frequency component with a wavelength defined by the bouncing time of the Alfv\'{e}n waves. In contrast, when the wave train is long enough to completely fill the flux tube, and the Alfv\'{e}n waves overlap significantly, the energy is quickly converted into a fast wave with a higher frequency that corresponds to twice the Alfv\'{e}n wave frequency. We investigate how the energy, duration, and wavelength of the initial Alfv\'{e}n wave train affect the conversion efficiency to fast waves. For modestly energetic star quakes, we see that the fast waves that are produced will become non-linear well within the magnetosphere, and we comment on the X-ray emission that one may expect from such events.</description>

      <title>An Optical Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue with Measured Redshift PART I: Data Release of 535 Gamma-Ray Bursts and Colour Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest optical photometry compilation of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with redshifts ($z$). We include 64813 observations of 535 events (including upper limits) from 28 February 1997 up to 18 August 2023. We also present a user-friendly web tool \textit{grbLC} which allows users the visualization of photometry, coordinates, redshift, host galaxy extinction, and spectral indices for each event in our database. Furthermore, we have added a Gamma Ray Coordinate Network (GCN) scraper that can be used to collect data by gathering magnitudes from the GCNs. The web tool also includes a package for uniformly investigating colour evolution. We compute the optical spectral indices for 138 GRBs for which we have at least 4 filters at the same epoch in our sample and craft a procedure to distinguish between GRBs with and without colour evolution. By providing a uniform format and repository for the optical catalogue, this web-based archive is the first step towards unifying several community efforts to gather the photometric information for all GRBs with known redshifts. This catalogue will enable population studies by providing light curves (LCs) with better coverage since we have gathered data from different ground-based locations. Consequently, these LCs can be used to train future LC reconstructions for an extended inference of the redshift. The data gathering also allows us to fill some of the orbital gaps from Swift in crucial points of the LCs, e.g., at the end of the plateau emission or where a jet break is identified.</description>

      <title>Early flash-ionization lines in SN 2024ggi revealed by high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the nearby core-collapse (CC) supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN that ocurred in the galaxy NGC 3621, at a distance of 7.11 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectroscopy of a CCSN ever made. We analyze the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 26.6 and 33.8h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R\approx22600-28000$) at the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, during the night of 2024-04-12UT. We constrain emission line features in the early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi. We analyze the evolution of main spectroscopic features and the occurrence of high-ionization emission lines, by estimating their full width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and blueshift velocities. We then compare our results to other early-time observations of CCSNe. The spectra show strong and narrow features of Balmer emission lines and of high-ionization species of HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, together with relatively broader emission features of NIV and CIV. Some of these features become broader or disappear in the interval of 8h, indicating the rapid changes in the early evolution of CCSNe flash-ionization features. The HeII, CIV, NIV and Balmer emission lines have asymmetric Lorentzian profiles, with the HeII $\lambda4686$ broad component showing blue wings that extends up to $\sim-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. We also measure a CSM expansion velocity of $\sim 79 \ \textrm{km} \ \textrm{s}^{-1}$ from the blueshift in the H$\alpha$ emission profile, and a total extinction in the line of sight of $E(B-V)=0.16$ mag. Finally, we note many similarities of SN 2024ggi to the early evolution of SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Accurate standard siren cosmology with joint gravitational-wave and $\gamma$-ray burst observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint gravitational-wave and $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB) observations are among the best prospects for standard siren cosmology. However, the strong selection effect for the coincident GRB detection, which is possible only for sources with small inclination angles, induces a systematic uncertainty that is currently not accounted for. We show that this severe source of bias can be removed by inferring the a-priori unknown electromagnetic detection probability directly from multimessenger data. This leads at the same time to an unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant, to constrain the properties of GRB emission, and to accurately measure the viewing angle of each source. Our inference scheme is applicable to real data already in the small-statistics regime, a scenario that might become reality in the near future. Additionally, we introduce a novel likelihood approximant for GW events which treats the dependence on distance and inclination as exact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS I: Searching for Low Surface Brightness X-ray Emission with Chandra/ACIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SAUNAS (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), a pipeline designed for detecting diffuse X-ray emission in the data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. SAUNAS queries the available observations in the Chandra archive, performs photometric calibration, PSF (point spread function) modeling, and deconvolution, point-source removal, adaptive smoothing, and background correction. This pipeline builds on existing and well-tested software including CIAO, VorBin, and LIRA. We characterize the performance of SAUNAS through several quality performance tests, and demonstrate the broad applications and capabilities of SAUNAS using two galaxies already known to show X-ray emitting structures. SAUNAS successfully detects the 30 kpc X-ray super-wind of NGC 3079 using Chandra/ACIS datasets, matching the spatial distribution detected with more sensitive XMM-Newton observations. The analysis performed by SAUNAS reveals an extended low surface brightness source in the field of UGC 5101 in the 0.3-1.0 keV and 1.0-2.0 keV bands. This source is potentially a background galaxy cluster or a hot gas plume associated with UGC 5101. SAUNAS demonstrates its ability to recover previously undetected structures in archival data, expanding exploration into the low surface brightness X-ray universe with Chandra/ACIS.</description>

      <title>Consequences of a low-mass, high-pressure, star formation mode in early galaxies</title>

Abstract: High resolution X-ray spectra reveal hidden cooling flows depositing cold gas at the centres of massive nearby early-type galaxies with little sign of normal star formation. Optical observations are revealing that a bottom-heavy Initial Mass Function is common within the inner kpc of similar galaxies. We revive the possibility that a low-mass star formation mode is operating due to the high thermal pressure in the cooling flow, thus explaining the accumulation of low-mass stars. We further explore whether such a mode operated in early, high-redshift galaxies and has sporadically continued to the present day. The idea links observed distant galaxies with black holes which are ultramassive for their stellar mass, nearby red nuggets and massive early-type galaxies. Nearby elliptical galaxies may be red but they are not dead.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>PINT: Maximum-likelihood estimation of pulsar timing noise parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PINT is a pure-Python framework for high-precision pulsar timing developed on top of widely used and well-tested Python libraries, supporting both interactive and programmatic data analysis workflows. We present a new frequentist framework within PINT to characterize the single-pulsar noise processes present in pulsar timing datasets. This framework enables the parameter estimation for both uncorrelated and correlated noise processes as well as the model comparison between different timing and noise models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new framework by applying it to simulated datasets as well as a real dataset of PSR B1855+09. We also briefly describe the new features implemented in PINT since it was first described in the literature.</description>

      <title>On its way to the neutron star-white dwarf binary graveyard, IGR J16194-2810, a first ascent M giant X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-lined spectroscopic orbit for the M giant in the X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810 is determined from a time-series of optical spectra. The spectroscopic orbital period of 192.5 days is twice that of the photometric period, confirming that the M giant in the system is an ellipsoidal variable. The giant is identified as a first ascent giant approaching the red giant tip. The primary is a neutron star (NS) with its M giant companion filling its Roche lobe verifying the system classification as a Low-Mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Stellar C, N, O and Fe abundances are derived for the M giant with the C, N, O values typical for a field giant with [Fe/H] = -0.14. The system does not have a large kick velocity. Models for the evolution of the system into a binary NS-white dwarf (WD) are presented. The X-ray properties are discussed in the context of this model. This binary is a rare example of a luminous, long orbital period, LMXB early in the transient ellipsoidal phase.</description>

      <title>Testing Hadronic-Model Predictions of Depth of Maximum of Air-Shower Profiles and Ground-Particle Signals using Hybrid Data of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the predictions of hadronic interaction models regarding the depth of maximum of air-shower profiles, $X_{max}$, and ground-particle signals in water-Cherenkov detectors at 1000 m from the shower core, $S(1000)$, using the data from the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The test consists in fitting the measured two-dimensional ($S(1000)$, $X_{max}$) distributions using templates for simulated air showers produced with hadronic interaction models EPOS-LHC, QGSJet II-04, Sibyll 2.3d and leaving the scales of predicted $X_{max}$ and the signals from hadronic component at ground as free fit parameters. The method relies on the assumption that the mass composition remains the same at all zenith angles, while the longitudinal shower development and attenuation of ground signal depend on the mass composition in a correlated way.
  The analysis was applied to 2239 events detected by both the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory with energies between $10^{18.5}$ to $10^{19.0}$ eV and zenith angles below $60^\circ$. We found, that within the assumptions of the method, the best description of the data is achieved if the predictions of the hadronic interaction models are shifted to deeper $X_{max}$ values and larger hadronic signals at all zenith angles. Given the magnitude of the shifts and the data sample size, the statistical significance of the improvement of data description using the modifications considered in the paper is larger than $5\sigma$ even for any linear combination of experimental systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>High angular momentum hot differentially rotating equilibrium star evolutions in conformally flat spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal flatness approximation to the Einstein equations has been successfully used in many astrophysical applications such as initial data constructions and dynamical simulations. Although it has been shown that full general relativistic strongly differentially rotating equilibrium models deviate by at most a few percent from their conformally flat counterparts, whether those conformally flat solutions remain stable has not been fully addressed. To further understand the limitations of the conformal flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially-conformally-flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with post-merger-like rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis over dynamical timescales. We find that enforcing conformally-flat spacetime could change the equilibrium of quasi-toroidal models with high angular momentum for $J \gtrsim 9 ~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$ compared to fully general relativistic cases. In contrast, all the quasi-spherical models considered in this work remain stable even with high angular momentum $J=9~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$. Our investigation suggests that the quasi-spherical models are suitable initial data for long-lived hypermassive neutron star modeling in conformally flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of star motions, offers an alternative avenue to investigate low-frequency gravitational waves through the spatial deflection of photons, complementing pulsar timing arrays reliant on timing residuals. Upcoming data from Gaia and Roman can not only cross-check pulsar timing array findings but also explore the uncharted frequency range bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA. We present an analytical framework to evaluate the feasibility of detecting a gravitational wave background, considering measurement noise and the intrinsic variability of the stochastic background. Furthermore, we highlight astrometry's crucial role in uncovering key properties of the gravitational wave background, such as spectral index and chirality, employing information-matrix analysis. Finally, we simulate the emergence of quadrupolar correlations, commonly referred to as the generalized Hellings-Downs curves.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein-Rosen bridge inside black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Einstein-Rosen bridge by defining it as a space-like connection between two universes with regions of asymptotically minkowskian space-time infinities. The corresponding symmetry and asymmetry properties of the generalized Einstein-Rosen bridge are considered at the cases of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr metrics. We elucidate the versatility of intriguing symmetry and asymmetry phenomena outside and inside black holes. For description of the test particle (planet and photon) motion it is used the Kerr-Newman metric of the rotating and electrically charged black hole. In particular, it is demonstrated the symmetry and asymmetry of the one-way Einstein-Rosen bridge inside black hole toward and through the plethora of endless and infinite universes.</description>
