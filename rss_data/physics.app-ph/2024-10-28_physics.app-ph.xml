      <title>Localized Band Gap Resonances in Defect-embedded Monoatomic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, structural defects in crystalline material lattice structures have been viewed as a liability, causing the material behavior to deviate from the expected norm. However, the gradual improvement in understanding the role of defects has overturned this view, encouraging positive outlooks, e.g., deliberately engineering defects in structures, that have laid the foundation for modern applications, e.g., silicon chip manufacturing, battery engineering, fuel cell engineering. In recent years, acoustic metamaterials (AMMs), which have emerged as a platform for customizing acoustic behavior, have also embraced this shift in viewpoint, enabling design propositions involving precisely embedded defects in the AMM architecture that may be relevant for applications, e.g., energy harvesting, waveguiding, flow control. The fundamental utility of defects stems from their ability to robustly localize energy at a prescribed location with desirable spatio-temporal characteristics. However, the bulk of existing defect-based AMM studies primarily present a qualitative numerical analysis, prompting the need for an analytical approach quantifying the defect eigenmode characteristics, e.g., frequency, mode shape, resonance velocity amplitude envelope to precisely engineer defects in AMMs. This article presents a modified analytical method to determine the eigenmode characteristics of a defect-embedded grounded monoatomic chain (DMoA) and demonstrates the benefits of defect modes through two DMoA-based AMMs that can accommodate -- (i) a virtual ground, and (ii) achieve customized acoustic interaction and absorption. The proposed strategy can be readily extended to more elaborate AMMs and augments the design space for defect-based AMMs.</description>

      <title>Towards active stiffness control in pattern-forming pneumatic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern-forming metamaterials feature microstructures specifically designed to change the material's macroscopic properties due to internal instabilities. These can be triggered either by mechanical deformation or, in the case of active materials, by other external stimuli, such as pneumatic actuation. We study a two-dimensional rectangular lattice microstructure which is pneumatically actuated by non-uniform pressure patterns in its voids, and demonstrate that this actuation may lead toifferent instability patterns. The patterns are associated with a significant reduction in the macroscopic stiffness of the material. The magnitude of this reduction can be controlled by different arrangements of the pressure actuation, thus choosing the precise buckled shape of the microstructure. We develop an analytical model and complement it with computational tests on a two-dimensional plane-strain finite element model. We explain the phenomenon and discuss ways of further developing the concept to actively control the stiffness of materials and structures.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Room-Temperature Ferroelectricity in Metal Oxide Monolayers for Advanced Logic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectric materials are beneficial for power-efficient memory devices and transistor applications. Here, we predict out-of-plane ferroelectricity in a new family of buckled metal oxide (MO; M: Ge, Sn, Pb) monolayers with significant spontaneous polarization. Additionally, these monolayers have a narrow valence band, which is energetically separated from the rest of the low-lying valence bands. Such a unique band structure limits the long thermal tail of the hot carriers, mitigating subthreshold thermionic leakage and allowing field-effect transistors (FETs) to function beyond the bounds imposed on conventional FETs by thermodynamics. Our quantum transport simulations reveal that the FETs based on these MO monolayers exhibit a large ON/OFF ratio with an average subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/decade at room temperature, even for short gate lengths. Our work motivates further exploration of the MO monolayers for developing advanced, high-performance memory and logic devices.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectrically actuated high-speed spatial light modulator for visible to near-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in light modulator technology have been driving discoveries and progress across various fields. The problem of large-scale coherent optical control of atomic quantum systems-including cold atoms, ions, and solid-state color centers-presents among the most stringent requirements. This motivates a new generation of high-speed large-scale modulator technology with the following requirements: (R1) operation at a design wavelength of choice in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, (R2) a scalable technology with a high channel density (&gt; 100mm-2 ), (R3) a high modulation speed (&gt; 100MHz), and (R4) a high extinction ratio (&gt; 20 dB). To fulfill these requirements, we introduce a modulator technology based on piezoelectrically actuated silicon nitride resonant waveguide gratings fabricated on 200mm diameter silicon wafers with CMOS compatible processes. We present a proof-of-concept device with 4 x 4 individually addressable 50 {mu}m x 50 {mu}m pixels or channels, each containing a resonant waveguide grating with a ~ 780 nm design wavelength, supporting &gt; 100MHz modulation speeds, and a spectral response with &gt; 20 dB extinction.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-petahertz all-optical electric field sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-optical concept for measuring the electric field of light spanning from infrared to extreme ultraviolet with multi-petahertz detection bandwidth. Our approach employs a heterodyne detection of light produced by a highly nonlinear light-matter interaction gate. We establish a numerical model of a complex spectral response for unambiguous electric field extraction and benchmark it against the experiment. We show that the concept can be applied for measuring wavelengths down to about 60 nm with a high sensitivity and dynamic range of about 40 decibels. This opens up unprecedented perspectives for spatio-temporal electric field-resolved experiments and control of broadband dynamics of matter.</description>

      <title>Single-shot X-ray ptychography as a structured illumination method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-shot ptychography is a quantitative phase imaging method wherein overlapping beams of light arranged in a grid pattern simultaneously illuminate a sample, allowing a full ptychographic dataset to be collected in a single shot. It is primarily used at optical wavelengths, but there is interest in using it for X-ray imaging. However, the constraints imposed by X-ray optics have limited the resolution achievable to date. In this work, we reinterpret single-shot ptychography as a structured illumination method by viewing the grid of beams as a single, highly structured illumination function. Pre-calibrating this illumination and reconstructing single-shot data using the randomized probe imaging algorithm allows us to account for the overlap and coherent interference between the diffraction arising from each beam. We achieve a resolution 3.5 times finer than the numerical aperture-based limit imposed by traditional algorithms for single-shot ptychography. We argue that this reconstruction method will work better for most single-shot ptychography experiments and discuss the implications for the design of future single-shot X-ray microscopes.</description>

      <title>Imaging magnetic switching in orthogonally twisted stacks of a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking van der Waals magnets holds promise for creating new hybrid materials with properties that do not exist in bulk materials. Here we investigate orthogonally twisted stacks of the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr, aiming to exploit an extreme misalignment of magnetic anisotropy across the twisted interface.Using nitrogen-vacancy centre microscopy, we construct vector maps of the magnetisation, and track their evolution under an external field, in a range of twisted compensated and uncompensated configurations differing by the number of layers. We show that twisted stacking consistently modifies the local magnetic switching behaviour of constituent flakes, and that these modifications are spatially non-uniform. In the case of compensated component flakes (even number of layers), we demonstrate that the combination of dipolar coupling and stacking-induced strain can reduce the switching field by over an order of magnitude. Conversely, in uncompensated component flakes (odd number of layers), we observe indications of a non-zero interlayer exchange interaction between twisted flakes during magnetization reversal, which can persistently modify magnetic order. This work highlights the importance of spatial imaging in investigating stacking-induced magnetic effects, particularly in the case of twistronics where spatial variation is expected and can be conflated with structural imperfections.</description>

      <title>The effect of space charge on photon-enhanced thermionic emission in the presence of the bidirectional discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bidirectional space charge effects in photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices are investigated systematically. First, we precisely determine the carrier concentrations and cathode temperatures by taking into account the electron recycling effect, energy balance constraints, and space charge effects arising from the concurrent discharge of the cathode and anode. Next, we analyze the impact of critical parameters, including anode properties and operating conditions, on the space charge barrier distribution and the overall performance of the device. The results demonstrate that the impact of reverse discharge on the net current becomes more pronounced when the PETE device operates at high anode temperatures, low anode work functions, and with a moderate solar concentration ratio and gap width. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of the bidirectional space charge effect, but also provides valuable guidance for the future optimization of PETE device performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrometry of non-volatile space charges in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic electric environment surrounding a spin defect in a wide-bandgap semiconductor plays a determining role in the spin coherence and charge stability of a given qubit and has an equally important role in defining the electrical properties of the host material. Here, we use electrometry of quantum defects embedded within a diamond to observe stable, micron-scale space charge distributions formed from trapped photogenerated charges. These space charges grow under optical illumination in the presence of an applied electric field, eventually screening the applied electric field entirely over a spatial extent of tens of microns due to charge carrier drift and capture. Our measurements suggest that these space charge fields originate from widely-dispersed spatial configurations of nitrogen charges. Our results have important consequences for electrometry and photoelectric detection using qubits in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic strain sensing using Doppler-shift-immune phase-sensitive OFDR with ultra-weak reflection array and frequency-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed fiber-optic sensing based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR), Doppler frequency shifts due to the changes of disturbances during one sweep period introduce demodulation errors that accumulate along both the distance and time, impairing the sensing performance. Here, we report distributed dynamic strain sensing using Doppler-shift-immune phase-sensitive OFDR based on frequency-tracking and spectrum-zooming with ultra-weak reflection array. Theoretical study has been carried out with the introduction of mismatch coefficient, unveiling quantitatively the impact of Doppler shift. Following a numerical analysis of the proposed method, a retained precision has been experimentally verified regardless of the position mismatch due to the Doppler effect. Doppler-shift-immune sensing for dynamic strains covering continuous spatial resolution over a distance of 1000 m with a 2.5 cm sensing spatial resolution has been demonstrated, verifying the high fidelity promised by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Physics-based inverse modeling of battery degradation with Bayesian methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To further improve Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), a profound understanding of complex battery processes is crucial. Physical models offer understanding but are difficult to validate and parameterize. Therefore, automated machine-learning methods (ML) are necessary to evaluate models with experimental data. Bayesian methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization for likelihood-free inference (EP-BOLFI), stand out as they capture uncertainties in models and data while granting meaningful parameterization. An important topic is prolonging battery lifetime, which is limited by degradation, such as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. As a case study, we apply EP-BOLFI to parametrize SEI growth models with synthetic and real degradation data. EP-BOLFI allows for incorporating human expertise in the form of suitable feature selection, which improves the parametrization. We show that even under impeded conditions, we achieve correct parameterization with reasonable uncertainty quantification, needing less computational effort than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the physically reliable summary statistics show if parameters are strongly correlated and not unambiguously identifiable. Further, we investigate Bayesian alternately subsampled quadrature (BASQ), which calculates model probabilities, to confirm electron diffusion as the best theoretical model to describe SEI growth during battery storage.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-low-loss Compact Phase-Change Material-based Hybrid-mode Interferometer for Photonic Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid mode interferometer (HMI) leveraging the interference of hybridized TE-TM modes in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide integrated with a GeSe phase change material (PCM) layer. The SOI waveguide's dimensions are optimized to support the hybridization of the fundamental transverse magnetic ($TM_0$) and the first higher transverse electric ($TE_1$) mode. This design allows for efficient and nearly equal power coupling between these two modes, resulting in high-contrast interference when starting from the amorphous PCM state. The PCM's phase transition induces a differential change in the modal effective index, enabling high-contrast transmittance modulation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate a multilevel transmission with a high contrast of nearly 14 dB, when the amorphous region's length is varied incrementally, enabling multi-bit storage. The transmittance is maximized in the fully crystalline state with an insertion loss below 0.1 dB. The HMI can also operate as a quasi-pure phase shifter when partially amorphized, making it suitable for Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These characteristics make the proposed device a promising candidate for applications in photonic memories and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable, zero-energy, and wide-temperature loss-assisted thermal nonreciprocal metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal nonreciprocity plays a vital role in chip heat dissipation, energy-saving design, and high-temperature hyperthermia, typically realized through the use of advanced metamaterials with nonlinear, advective, spatiotemporal, or gradient properties. However, challenges such as fixed structural designs with limited adjustability, high energy consumption, and a narrow operational temperature range remain prevalent. Here, a systematic framework is introduced to achieve reconfigurable, zero-energy, and wide-temperature thermal nonreciprocity by transforming wasteful heat loss into a valuable regulatory tool. Vertical slabs composed of natural bulk materials enable asymmetric heat loss through natural convection, disrupting the inversion symmetry of thermal conduction. The reconfigurability of this system stems from the ability to modify heat loss by adjusting thermal conductivity, size, placement, and quantity of the slabs. Moreover, this structure allows for precise control of zero-energy thermal nonreciprocity across a broad temperature spectrum, utilizing solely environmental temperature gradients without additional energy consumption. This research presents a different approach to achieving nonreciprocity, broadening the potential for nonreciprocal devices such as thermal diodes and topological edge states, and inspiring further exploration of nonreciprocity in other loss-based systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the working principle of four-switch cross-shaped reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in detail and reveals the different types of RIS that can be designed based on this structure. Combined with the design examples using this structure in the currently published articles, this paper summarizes and organizes them, and also points out several RIS solutions that have not been designed using this structure. Finally, based on this four-switch cross-shaped structure, this paper proposes a novel RIS design example that can realize the function switching of 1-bit ultra-wideband (UWB) and 2-bit narrowband, and conducts simulation verification. The simulation results show that by optimizing the element structure and controlling the states of the four switches, the 1-bit ultra-wideband function can achieve a frequency band coverage of 10.5GHz-19.8GHz and a 2-bit phase quantization function around 18.12GHz. At the same time, it can realize 60{\deg} two-dimensional beam scanning function. We call this novel design "bit reconfigurable metasurface".</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Spin Centers in Photocatalytic Metal-Organic Framework UiO-66</title>

Abstract: Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for advanced photocatalytically active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface areas and structural tunability and are thus highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic processes in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (trPL), the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation are investigated, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. A manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers is detected, which is subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Under UV illumination, the symmetry, g-tensors and lifetimes of three distinct contributions are revealed: a surface O2-radical, a light-induced electron-hole pair, and a triplet exciton. Notably, the latter was found to emit (delayed) fluorescence. Our findings provide new insights into the photoinduced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Integration of Freestanding Photonic Devices with Color Centers in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color center platforms have been at the forefront of quantum nanophotonics for applications in quantum networking, computing, and sensing. However, large-scale deployment of this technology has been stifled by a lack of ability to integrate photonic devices at scale while maintaining the properties of quantum emitters. We address this challenge in silicon carbide which has both commercially available wafer-scale substrates and is a host to color centers with desirable optical and spin properties. Using ion beam etching at an angle, we develop a 5-inch wafer process for the fabrication of triangular cross-section photonic devices in bulk 4H-SiC. The developed process has a variability in etch rate and etch angle of 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated color centers maintain their optical properties after the etch, thus achieving the nanofabrication goal of wafer-scale nanofabrication in quantum-grade silicon carbide.</description>
