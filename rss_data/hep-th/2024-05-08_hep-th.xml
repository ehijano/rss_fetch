      <title>Null states and time evolution in a toy model of black hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes can provide non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral that make the actual number of states $e^S$ in a gravitational system much smaller than the number of states $e^{S_{\mathrm{p}}}$ predicted by perturbative semiclassical effective field theory. The effects on the physics of the system are naturally profound in contexts in which the perturbative description actively involves $N = O(e^S)$ of the possible $e^{S_{\mathrm{p}}}$ perturbative states; e.g., in late stages of black hole evaporation. Such contexts are typically associated with the existence of non-trivial quantum extremal surfaces. However, by forcing a simple topological gravity model to evolve in time, we find that such effects can also have large impact for $N\ll e^S$ (in which case no quantum extremal surfaces can arise). In particular, even for small $N$, the insertion of generic operators into the path integral can cause the non-perturbative time evolution to differ dramatically from perturbative expectations. On the other hand, this discrepancy is small for the special case where the inserted operators are non-trivial only in a subspace of dimension $D \ll e^S$. We thus study this latter case in detail. We also discuss potential implications for more realistic gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Correction and Its Breakdown to Thermodynamics of Rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt the Reall-Santos method to obtain the quadratic curvature corrections to the thermodynamics of Myers-Perry rotating black holes in diverse dimensions. We consider the corrections in canonical and grand canonical ensembles, and also for fixed mass and angular momenta. We find that there exist inevitable divergences for generic rotation parameters so that the perturbative approach breaks down. We present a simple and universal formula to determine where these divergences could arise, and argue, using an explicit example, that these divergences are artefact of perturbation and may not exist in the full nonlinear theory.</description>

      <title>An index for flux vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use the winding number of the gradient of a scalar potential as a simple topological index that relates critical points in the interior of the scalar field space to the behavior of the potential at the (asymptotic) boundary of the field space. We demonstrate this technique for supersymmetric flux compactifications of M-theory on Calabi-Yau four-folds, and use the Fermat sextic as a simple, one-parameter example.</description>

      <title>Weak cosmic censorship and the rotating quantum BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture examine the possibility of the breakdown of predictivity of the gravitational theory considered, by checking if curvature singularities typically present in black hole spacetimes are concealed within an event horizon at all times. A possible method to perform such tests was proposed by Wald and consists in trying to overspin an extremal rotating black hole by throwing at it a test particle with large angular momentum. In this paper, we analyze the effects of dropping a test particle into an extremal quantum rotating BTZ black hole, whose three-dimensional metric captures the exact backreaction from strongly coupled quantum conformal fields. Our analysis reveals that, despite the inclusion of quantum effects, and akin to the classical scenario, these attempts to destroy the black hole are doomed to be unsuccessful. Particles carrying the maximum angular momentum and still falling into an extremal quantum BTZ black hole can, at most, leave it extremal. Nevertheless, we found numerical evidence that large backreaction of the quantum fields tends to disfavor violations of cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Plasma-Plasma Third Order Phase Transition from type IIB Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the planar, charged black hole in AdS, dual to the strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma thermal state of large $N$, $SU(N)$, $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at finite chemical potential undergoes a third-order phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble to a hairy black hole of type IIB supergravity. The hairy phase is another strongly coupled fluid with a conformal equation of state and can be interpreted as another kind of Quark-Gluon plasma. This new Quark-Gluon plasma has less entropy and, therefore, seems to characterize some form of smooth hadronization. The locus of the transition in terms of the "Baryon" chemical potential, $\mu$, and the temperature, $T$, is $\mu=2\pi T$.</description>

      <title>Non-anomalous non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D from gapped boundaries of SymTFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anomalies of non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D QFTs using gapped boundaries of its SymTFT. We establish the explicit relation between Lagrangian algebras which determine gapped boundaries of the SymTFT, and algebras which determine non-anomalous/gaugeable topological line operators in the 1+1D QFT. If the Lagrangian algebras in the SymTFT are known, this provides a method to compute algebras in all fusion categories that share the same SymTFT. We find necessary conditions that a line operator in the SymTFT must satisfy for the corresponding line operator in the 1+1D QFT to be non-anomalous. We use this constraint to show that a non-invertible symmetry admits a 1+1D trivially gapped phase if and only if the SymTFT admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra. We define a process of transporting non-anomalous line operators between fusion categories which share the same SymTFT and apply this method to the three Haagerup fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Momentum non-conservation in a scalar quantum field theory with a planar $\theta$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest aroused by non-dynamical axionic electrodynamics in the context of topological insulators and Weyl semimetals, we discuss a simple model of the magnetoelectric effect in terms of a $\theta$-scalar field that interacts through a delta-like potential located at a planar interface. Thus, in the bulk regions the field is constructed by standard free waves with the absence of evanescent components. These waves have to be combined into linear superposition to account for the boundary conditions at the interface in order to yield the corresponding normal modes. Our aim is twofold: first we quantize the $\theta$-scalar field using the normal modes in the canonical approach and then we look for applications emphasizing the effect of momentum non-conservation due to the presence of the interface. To this end we calculate the decay of a standard scalar particle into two $\theta$-scalar particles showing the opening of new decay channels. As a second application we deal with the two body scattering of standard charged scalar particles mediated by a $\theta$-scalar particle, focusing on the momentum non-conserving contribution of the scattering amplitude ${\cal M}^{NC}$. We define a generalization of the usual cross section in order to quantify the emergence of these events. We also study the allowed kinematical region for momentum non-conservation as well as the position of the poles of the amplitude ${\cal M}^{NC}$. Finally, the ratio of the magnitudes between ${\cal M}^{NC}$ and the momentum conserving amplitude is discussed in the appropriate region of momentum space.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the nonprojectable Horava theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis have shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic derivation of cluster alphabets of finite types. The construction is based on a geometric realization of the generalized worldsheets by gluing and folding a pair of polygons. The cross ratios of the worldsheet z variables are evolved using the Y-system equations. By a new gauge choice, we obtain a simpler set of cluster alphabets than the known ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a simple-sum giant graviton expansion of the superconformal indices of ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories realized on D3-branes probing $7$-brane backgrounds with constant axio-dilation field. The expansion is of self-dual type, and imposes strong constraints on the indices. By using the constraints we determine first few terms in the superconformal indices for arbitrary rank $N$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probabilities of a field, subject to random perturbations, to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. We find that the probability to roll down to the left or right depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra "bulk semionization" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A confined, slow-moving, accelerating electron is shown to emit thermal radiation. Since laboratories face spatial constraints when dealing with rectilinear motion, focusing on a finite total travel distance combines the benefits of simple theoretical analysis with prospects for table-top experimentation. We demonstrate an accelerated moving charge along an asymptotically static worldline with fixed transit distance and slow maximum speed, emitting self-consistent analytic power, spectra, and energy. The classical radiation is Planck distributed with an associated acceleration temperature. This is the first fully parametrized, spectrum-solved, finite-distance worldline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the consistency of field localization in 5D braneworld scenarios. We derive tensorial consistency relations, Local Sum Rules, which impose constraints on braneworld models featuring quasi-localized bulk fields. We apply these Local Sum Rules to simple cases involving massless scalar, vector, and spinor fields. Our analysis reveals that, when accounting for the effects of the Einstein equations on the bulk field, the free vector and spinor modes cannot be localized on the brane without the introduction of special mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number -flavor separation in the topological expansion of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance of QCD dictates the presence of string junctions in the wave functions of baryons. In high-energy inclusive processes, these baryon junctions have been predicted to induce the separation of the flows of baryon number and flavor. In this paper we describe this phenomenon using the analog-gas model of multiparticle production proposed long time ago by Feynman and Wilson and adapted here to accommodate the topological expansion in QCD. In this framework, duality arguments suggest the existence of two degenerate junction-antijunction glueball Regge trajectories of opposite $\cal{C}$-parity with intercept close to 1/2. The corresponding results for the energy and rapidity dependence of baryon stopping are in reasonably good agreement with recent experimental findings from STAR and ALICE experiments. We show that accounting for correlations between the fragmenting strings further improves agreement with the data, and outline additional experimental tests of our picture at the existing (RHIC, LHC, JLab) and future (EIC) facilities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have considered Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain special classes of initial states (e.g., states with particle-free regions or perturbations of stationary states), the velocity of information propagation was bounded by a constant in time, $v\leq C$, similarly to quantum spin systems. However, for the more general class of bounded-density initial states, the first-named author together with Vu and Saito derived the velocity bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial lattice dimension. For $D\geq 2$, this bound allows for accelerated information propagation. It has been known since the work of Eisert and Gross that some systems of lattice bosons are capable of accelerated information propagation. It is therefore a central question to understand under what conditions the bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$ can be enhanced. Here, we prove that additional physical constraints, translation-invariance and a $p$-body repulsion of the form $n_x^p$ with $p&gt;D+1$, lead to a LRB with $v\leq C t^{\frac{D}{p-D-1}}$ for any initial state of bounded energy density. We also identify examples of quantum states which show that no further enhancement is possible without using additional dynamical constraints.</description>

We consider two non-linear $f(R,L_m)$ functional forms, specifically, $f(R,L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + \lambda R^2 + \alpha L_m$ and $f(R,L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m ^\beta + \gamma$ representing a minimal coupling case. We derive the corresponding Friedmann-like equations for both the assumed models in the FLRW background, and then we present the impact of the model parameters along with the parameter of bouncing scale factor on the equation of state parameter, pressure, and the energy density. In addition, we examine the dynamical behavior of cosmographic parameters such as jerk, lerk, and snap parameters. Further, we find that the violation of the null energy condition along with the strong energy condition depicts the non-singular accelerating behavior, corresponding to both assumed non-linear $f(R,L_m)$ functions. Lastly, we present the behavior of the adiabatic speed of sound to examine the viability of the considered cosmological bouncing scenario.</description>

      <title>Thermal analysis of black hole in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity in Barrow entropy framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines a recently hypothesized black hole solution in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity. Firstly, we consider the negative cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. We extract the thermodynamical properties such as Hawking temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy using the Barrow entropy. We also obtain a new pressure associated to the perfect fluid dark matter and discuss the first-order van der Waals-like phase transition. This black hole's stability is investigated through specific heat and Gibbs free energy. Also, we analyze the thermodynamic curvatures behavior of black hole through geometry methods (Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyah-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM), and geometrothermodynamics (GTD)).</description>

      <title>The simplest model of a scalarized black hole in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum information, encoded in a quantum field, evolves during the expansion of spacetime. Due to information loss across the horizon, a local observer experiences this evolution as a nonunitary quantum channel. We obtain this channel in the case of de Sitter spacetime by assuming the initial global state encodes a signal state via fluctuations of the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Notably, de Sitter evolution exhibits intriguing cloning properties, establishing a connection between the curvature of spacetime and the propagation of quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We review the experimental constraints on the parameter $\alpha$ associated with the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and the parameter $\beta$ associated with the Generalized Event Horizon (GEH). The Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence implies a relationship between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with both parameters being of order 1. This presents a problem for our previous `$M+1/M$' model since the extra gravitational force at sub-Planckian masses contravenes observations. Various resolutions of this problem are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the large N limit of a family of quartic Dirac ensembles based on (0, 1) fuzzy geometries that are coupled to fermions. These Dirac ensembles are examples of single-matrix, multi-trace matrix ensembles. Additionally, they serve as examples of integer-valued $\beta$-ensembles. Convergence of the spectral density in the large N limit for a large class of such matrix ensembles is proven, improving on existing results. The main results of this paper are the addition of the fermionic contribution in the matrix ensemble and the investigation of spectral estimators for finite dimensional spectral triples</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin polarization in a thermal model with dissipative corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of longitudinal spin polarization of the $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We combine a relativistic kinetic-theory framework that includes spin degrees of freedom treated in a classical way with the freeze-out parametrization used in previous investigations. The use of the kinetic theory allows us to incorporate dissipative corrections (due to the thermal shear and gradients of thermal vorticity) into the Pauli-Lubanski vector that determines spin polarization and can be directly compared with the experimental data. As in earlier similar studies, it turns out that a successful description of data can only be achieved with additional assumptions -- in our case, they involve the use of projected thermal vorticity and a suitably adjusted time for spin relaxation ($\tau_s$). From our analysis, we find that $\tau_s \sim 5$ fm/$c$, which is comparable with other estimates.</description>

Abstract: We compute the local cohomology of vector fields on a manifold. In the smooth case this recovers the diagonal cohomology studied in work of Losik, Guillemin, Fuks and others. In the holomorphic case this cohomology has recently appeared in work of Hennion and Kapranov in their study of the Lie algebra cohomology of vector fields on a complex manifold. Additionally, we construct explicit representatives for cocycles in Gelfand--Fuks cohomology via descent.</description>

      <title>Notes on Wormhole Cancel lation and Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In AdS/CFT, partition functions of decoupled CFTs living on separate asymptotic boundaries factorize. However, the presence of bulk wormholes connecting different boundaries tends to spoil the factorization of the bulk partition function, which leads to a disagreement between the two sides. In this paper, we present two examples where wormhole contributions cancel each other in bulk partition function calculations, thus the bulk factorization can be realized. The first example is in 2-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the proposed way of realizing the cancellation resides in the extra complex phases associated with different wormholes. The phases arise due to the degenerate vacua structure. In the example of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, the cancellation can be achieved due to the distribution of the wormhole saddles on a complex plane. The two examples demonstrate a way of realizing bulk partition function factorization by extending the Hilbert space and dressing wormhole saddles with extra phases.</description>

      <title>Braneworld sum rules and positive tension branes in a massive gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By taking advantage of the braneworld sum rules, we explore the feasibility of constructing a flat 3-brane scenario consisting solely of positive tension branes in a 5D extension of the Lorentz-violating massive gravity. It is found that the theory supports three distinct brane configurations, one of which is exactly what we expected, consisting solely of two positive tension branes. The cosmological problem of Randall-Sundrum-1 model and the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved in this model simultaneously. Furthermore, the analysis of linear perturbations reveals that the tensor, vector and scalar modes are all massive and share the same mass spectrum, except that the ground state of vector mode is absent. Moreover, the tensor and vector modes are robust, but the scalar mode is ghost-like. Interestingly, even though the Kaluza-Klein gravitons have an extremely small mass splitting scale, an estimation of the effective gravitational potential and production of these gravitons on the brane indicates that the phenomenology of the present model is equivalent to that of the 6D ADD model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown recently that extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant is a dynamical variable, giving rise to a pressure $p$ and its conjugate volume $V$, can be given a natural setting in the context of braneworld models. We study the specific heat capacities $C_p(T)$ and $C_V(T)$ of the quantum version of the BTZ black hole that lives in the induced gravity theory on the brane. There are multiple branches of solutions, and we explore and characterize key features of the possible behaviour. We identify and study a critical point in the space of solutions where both specific heats diverge. In the regime of weak backreaction where we a close to an ordinary theory of gravity, the black hole is "sub-entropic", but as backreaction is increased we note that there are parts of parameter space that has regions where it is "super-entropic". While a study of the sign of the specific heats does not always show a corresponding instability (conjectured in the literature), the presence of strong backreaction makes interpretation unclear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classification of supersymmetric black hole solutions to five-dimensional STU gauged supergravity that admit torus symmetry. This reduces to a problem in toric K\"ahler geometry on the base space. We introduce the class of separable toric K\"ahler surfaces that unify product-toric, Calabi-toric and orthotoric K\"ahler surfaces, together with an associated class of separable 2-forms. We prove that any supersymmetric toric solution that is timelike, with a separable K\"ahler base space and Maxwell fields, outside a horizon with a compact (locally) spherical cross-section, must be locally isometric to the known black hole or its near-horizon geometry. An essential part of the proof is a near-horizon analysis which shows that the only possible separable K\"ahler base space is Calabi-toric. In particular, this also implies that our previous black hole uniqueness theorem for minimal gauged supergravity applies to the larger class of separable K\"ahler base spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a top-down construction of a three-dimensional non-local theory of massive gravity. This "Non-Local Massive Gravity" (NLMG) is obtained as the gravitational theory induced by Einstein gravity on a brane inserted in Anti-de Sitter space modified by an overall minus sign. The theory involves an infinite series of increasingly complicated higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action, with the quadratic term coinciding with New Massive Gravity. We obtain an analytic formula for the quadratic action of NLMG and show that its linearized spectrum consists of an infinite tower of positive-energy massive spin-2 modes. We compute the Newtonian potential and show that the introduction of the infinite series of terms makes it behave as $\sim 1/r$ at short distances, as opposed to the logarithmic behavior encountered when the series is truncated at any finite order. We use this and input from brane-world holography to argue that the theory may contain asymptotically flat black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new approach to RG flows and show that one-loop flows in multiscalar theories can be described by commutative but non-associative algebras. As an example related to $D$-brane field theories and tensor models, we study the algebra of a theory with $M$ $SU(N)$ adjoint scalars and its large $N$ limits. The algebraic concepts of idempotents and Peirce numbers/Kowalevski exponents are used to characterise the RG flows. We classify and describe all large $N$ limits of algebras of multiadjoint scalar models: the standard `t Hooft matrix theory limit, a `multi-matrix' limit, each with one free parameter, and an intermediate case with extra symmetry and no free parameter of the algebra, but an emergent free parameter from a line of one-loop fixed points. The algebra identifies these limits without diagrammatic or combinatorial analysis.</description>

Abstract: The distance conjecture diagnoses viable low-energy effective realisation of consistent theories of quantum gravity by examining their breakdown at infinite distance in their parameter space. At the same time, infinite distance points in parameter space are naturally intertwined with string dualities. We explore the implications of the distance conjecture when T-duality is applied to curved compact manifolds and in presence of (non-)geometric fluxes. We provide evidence of how divergent potentials signal pathological infinite distance points in the scalar field space where towers of light states cannot be sustained by the curved background. This leads us to suggest an extension to the current statement of the Swampland distance conjecture in curved spaces or in presence of non-trivial fluxes supporting the background.</description>

Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that (higher) gauge theories need, besides their variational phase space data, to be equipped with "flux quantization laws" in generalized differential cohomology, there used to be no general prescription for how to define and construct the resulting flux-quantized phase space stacks.
  In this short note we observe that all higher Maxwell-type equations have solution spaces given by flux densities on a Cauchy surface subject to a higher Gauss law and no further constraint: The metric duality-constraint is all absorbed into the evolution equation away from the Cauchy surface.
  Moreover, we observe that the higher Gauss law characterizes the Cauchy data as flat differential forms valued in a characteristic L-infinity-algebra. Using the recent construction of the non-abelian Chern-Dold character map, this implies that compatible flux quantization laws on phase space have classifying spaces whose rational Whitehead L-infinity algebra is this characteristic one. The flux-quantized higher phase space stack of the theory is then simply the corresponding (generally non-abelian) differential cohomology moduli stack on the Cauchy surface.
  We show how this systematic prescription subsumes existing proposals for flux-quantized phase spaces of vacuum Maxwell theory and of the chiral boson. Moreover, for the case of NS/RR-fields in type II supergravity, the traditional "Hypothesis K" of flux quantization in topological K-theory is naturally implied, without the need, on phase space, for the notorious further duality constraint. Finally, as a genuinely non-abelian example, we consider flux-quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity/M-theory given by unstable differential 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H") and emphasize again that, implemented on Cauchy data, this qualifies as the full phase space without the need for a further duality constraint.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the critical temperature and disorder in holographic superconductors on superfluid density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For example, the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature is generally linear, which is incompatible with the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. We develop an analytical method for AC conductivity calculation and explore the scaling relations among superconducting critical temperature, superfluid density, and momentum dissipation strength for the Gubser-Rocha model with extensions in the probe limit. In the normal phase, we show that the critical temperature is proportional to the momentum dissipation strength in a certain parameter range, which is universal in holographic models. In the superconducting phase, studying the AC conductivity analytically and numerically, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density (phase stiffness) on the critical superconducting temperature, which is consistent with recent experiments of high $T_c$ superconductors. These results further underpin the deep connections between strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use thermal effective field theory to derive that the coefficient of the first subleading piece of the thermal free energy, $c_1$, is equal to the coefficient of the subleading piece of the Casimir energy on $S^1 \times S^{d-2}$ for $d \geq 4$. We conjecture that this coefficient obeys a sign constraint $c_1 \geq 0$ in CFT and collect some evidence for this bound. We discuss various applications of the thermal effective field theory, including placing the CFT on different spatial backgrounds and turning on chemical potentials for $U(1)$ charge and angular momentum. Along the way, we derive the high-temperature partition function on a sphere with arbitrary angular velocities using only time dilation and length contraction.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of non-geometric fluxes to realize dS vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a systematic and analytical exploration of de Sitter conditions in type IIA compactifications with (non-)geometric fluxes along with the standard NS-NS and RR $p$-form fluxes. Exploiting the fact that the F-term scalar potential can be written as a bilinear form, we start by studying the most generic case. We find four conditions that the scalar fields and fluxes must satisfy to achieve de Sitter vacua. Particularizing to different configurations, we recover and extend previous results in the literature. We then impose an Ansatz in which the F-terms are proportional to the respective K\"ahler derivatives. In this set-up we are able to derive additional constraints and to classify the possible dS no-go scenarios in terms of eight axionic fluxes. Individually considering that any of these fluxes can be vanishing or non-vanishing leads to a total of 256 flux configurations. We find that 227 of these 256 possibilities result in a dS no-go scenario. The remaining 29 flux configurations, a priori, do not lead to dS no-go cases and would deserve further investigation.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow of fermions in the $\CP^2$ (anti-)instanton, and the sphaleron with vanishing topological charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral flow is ubiquitous in the physics of soliton-fermion interacting systems. We study the spectral flows related to a continuous deformation of background soliton solutions, which enable us to develop insight into the emergence of fermionic zero modes and the localization mechanism of fermion densities. We investigate a $\CP^2$ nonlinear sigma model in which there are the (anti-) instantons and also the sphalerons with vanishing topological charge. The standard Yukawa coupling of the fermion successfully generates infinite towers of the spectra and the spectral flow is observed when increasing the size of such solitons. At that moment, the localization of the fermions on the solitons emerges. The avoided crossings are also observed in several stages of the exchange of the flows, they are indicating a manifestation of the fermion exchange of the localizing nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of de Sitter vacua in O(d,d) invariant cosmologies. Starting with a homogeneous and isotropic framework we examine conditions for the existence of such vacua, non-perturbative in \alpha' in both the string frame and the Einstein frame. We elucidate the nature of the instability in the string frame vacuum. For the Einstein frame, we demonstrate that the de Sitter vacuum cannot be eternal. We then extend our analysis to include Bianchi I universes where the O(d,d) symmetry includes scale factor exchange as well as scale factor duality. We show how the theory can be extended to the anisotropic case so that it admits de Sitter vacua, noting the crucial role played by the O(d,d) symmetry in satisfying any additional constraints.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$ with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the complete set of minimal 3-point vertices for the massive Standard Model (SM) based purely on symmetry principles, mass dimension and high-energy behavior and without any recourse to field theory, gauge symmetries or Feynman rules. Because the gravitational vertices are no more challenging than any other vertices in this constructive method, we include them as well. We also calculate the high-energy behavior of these vertices and compare with the well-known massless vertices, both as a check and as a way to pin down the normalization constants. We include all these vertices in tables as a reference for future investigations.</description>

Abstract: We aim to address the following question: if we start with a quantum state with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry, what is the fate of the system under weak local quantum measurements? We demonstrate that under certain conditions, a phase transition can be driven by weak measurements, which suppresses the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry and weakens the 1-form symmetry charge fluctuation. We analyze the nature of the transitions employing the tool of duality, and we demonstrate that some of the transitions driven by weak measurement enjoy a line of fixed points with self-duality.</description>

      <title>Geometry and unitarity of scalar fields coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories coupled non-conformally to gravity in a manifestly frame-independent fashion. Physical quantities such as the $S$ matrix should be invariant under field redefinitions, and hence can be represented by the geometry of the target space. This elegant geometric formulation, however, is obscured when considering the coupling to gravity because of the redundancy associated with the Weyl transformation. The well-known example is the Higgs inflation, where the target space of the Higgs fields is flat in the Jordan frame but is curved in the Einstein frame. Furthermore, one can even show that any geometry of O$(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models can be flattened by an appropriate Weyl transformation. In this Letter, we extend the notion of the target space by including the conformal mode of the metric, and show that the extended geometry provides a compact formulation that is manifestly Weyl-transformation/field-redefinition invariant. We identify the cutoff scale with the inverse of square root of the extended target space curvature and confirm that it coincides with that obtained from two-to-two scattering amplitudes based on our formalism.</description>

      <title>Special Joyce structures and hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>
