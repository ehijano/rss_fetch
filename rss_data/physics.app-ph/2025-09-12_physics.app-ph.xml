      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Predicting Spatiotemporal Intensity and Variability of Outdoor Thermal Comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal conditions in the urban canopy exhibit stochastic variability driven by varied radiative fluxes and turbulent wind fields, requiring probabilistic rather than deterministic prediction methods. This study presents a probabilistic framework for predicting the spatial and temporal intensity and variability of outdoor thermal comfort in tropical urban environments. The framework integrates ground-measured meteorological data and remote sensing urban morphological data to calculate Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), and applies K-means, XGBoost, and Monte Carlo simulations on PET training and inference. The prediction model achieved strong performance, with R2, RMSE, and SMAPE values of 0.93, 0.81 degC, and 1.34% for PET_mean, and 0.85, 0.38 degC, and 10.44% for PET_std, respectively. A case study showed clear spatial heterogeneity of outdoor thermal comfort. Locations with dense tree canopies and vegetated surfaces displayed a normalized percentage of acceptable thermal comfort (NATC) up to 65%, whereas built-up zones dominated by impervious surfaces, such as industrial estates and high-density residential areas, recorded NATC below 30%. Greenery was found to mitigate both the intensity of heat stress and its variability, producing a stable and comfortable microclimate. Daytime PET_std ranged from 4.0-4.5 degC in built-up areas to 1.5-2.0 degC in greenery-covered zones, while nighttime PET_std decreased to 2.2-2.4 degC and 1.2-1.4 degC, respectively. These findings emphasize the critical role of greenery in mitigating thermal variability and enhancing outdoor thermal comfort, while revealing the stochastic nature of thermal comfort across different urban morphologies.</description>

      <title>LAOStrain response of carbon black-polymer hydrogels: insights from rheo-TRUSAXS and rheo-electric experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloid-polymer hydrogels are encountered in various applications, from flow batteries to drug delivery. Here, we investigate hydrogels composed of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles -- carbon black (CB) -- and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food-grade polymer functionalized with hydrophobic groups binding physically to CB. As described in [Legrand et al., Macromolecules 56, 2298-2308 (2023)], CB-CMC hydrogels exist in two flavors: either electrically conductive when featuring a percolated network of CB particles decorated by CMC, or insulating where isolated CB particles act as physical cross-linkers within the CMC matrix. We compare these two types of CB-CMC hydrogels under Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), combining rheometry with Time-Resolved Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TRUSAXS) and electrical conductivity measurements. Both types of hydrogels exhibit a "type III" yielding scenario, characterized by an overshoot in G'' and a monotonic decrease in G', although the underlying microscopic mechanisms differ markedly. Conductive CB-CMC hydrogels display a yield strain (6%) concomitant with a drop in DC conductivity, indicative of the macroscopic rupture of the percolated CB network at length scales larger than a few microns, beyond USAXS resolution. At larger strain amplitudes, the conductivity of the fluidized sample increases again, exceeding its initial value, consistent with shear-induced formation of a transient, dynamically percolated network of CB clusters. In contrast, insulating CB-CMC hydrogels exhibit a larger yield strain (60%), beyond which the sample flows and the average distance between CB particles decreases. This reorganization is concomitant with a more than tenfold increase in conductivity, although it remains below that of conductive hydrogels at rest.</description>

      <title>Shape-to-Music: A Musical Representation for Structural Topologies of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are increasingly attracting interest in engineering applications due to their unique mechanical properties and lightweight nature. This study develops a novel sound-based representation to characterize the topologies of mechanical metamaterials, including spinodal designs and porous cellular structures. Two distinct frameworks are introduced: an image-based approach, where material topologies are divided into grids and their relative densities are mapped to evolving melodies, and a numerical simulation approach, where finite element analysis (FEA) visualizes mechanical responses as color-coded images, translated into unique musical compositions. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the generated melodies are analyzed as frequency plots, revealing distinct acoustic signatures for each material topology. This innovative approach not only distinguishes between different metamaterial designs but also provides an intuitive, auditory tool for material characterization. The results demonstrate the potential of sound-based representations to complement traditional methods in materials modeling, offering new avenues for design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Simultaneous Environmental Variables on Perovskite Synthesis and Device Performance via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid rise in perovskite solar cell efficiency, poor reproducibility remains a major barrier to commercialization. Film crystallization and device performance are highly sensitive to environmental factors during fabrication, yet their complex interactions are not well understood. In this work, we present a systematic framework to investigate the influence of both individual and coupled environmental variables on device efficiency and crystallization kinetics. We developed an integrated fabrication platform with precise, independent control over ambient solvent partial pressure, absolute humidity, and temperature during spin-coating and thermal-annealing processes, respectively. Using the platform, we implemented a closed-loop Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently explore the multi-dimensional processing space. We mapped the impact of these environmental variables on device performance and identified coupled effects among them. In-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements further validated these findings by revealing a nonlinear interaction between absolute humidity and solvent partial pressure during spin-coating, which affects crystallization dynamics. To isolate and quantify these interactions, we developed an interpretable machine learning approach that combines knowledge distillation with Shapley interaction analysis. The model revealed the contribution of each interaction varies across different processing conditions. Our study highlights the importance of integrated ambient sensing and control to achieve repeatable perovskite solar cells, and demonstrates the utility of combining active learning with interpretable machine learning to navigate complex, high-dimensional processing landscapes.</description>

      <title>Rapid Manufacturing of Lightweight Drone Frames Using Single-Tow Architected Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames. However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally, maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering (3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment, eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly. Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic, outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and efficient manufacturing method.</description>

      <title>An Improved Rapid Performance Analysis Model for Solenoidal Magnetic Radiation Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronauts participating in deep-space exploration missions will be exposed to significantly greater amounts of radiation than is typically encountered on Earth or in low Earth orbit (LEO), which poses significant risks to crew health and mission safety. Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz deflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses with lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active shielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations, which are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of shield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and Energy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method by which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various simplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy, and therefore require evaluation and correction. In this work, a number of aspects of the original semi-analytical model are updated and validated by Monte Carlo simulation, then used to recharacterize the design trade space of solenoidal magnetic shields. The updated model predicts improved performance for weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished performance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m. Overall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass savings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose reduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most exploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside LEO.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial Bifocal and Optical Vortex Generation of DNG Materials Unveiled by Generalized Transfer Matrix Method and Matrix Fourier Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation and analysis of exotic physical phenomena facilitated by metamaterials have emerged as a compelling area of interest in physics, material science, and engineering. However, there remains a lack of suitable theoretical tools for scrutinizing light-matter interactions in metamedia, particularly those involving distinct constitutive tensors, such as polarization cross-coupling or non-reciprocal propagation induced by bianisotropy. In this research, we apply the generalized transfer matrix method and matrix Fourier Optics to devise a novel hybrid methodology adept at efficiently tracing an optical beam as it propagates through transverse-homogeneous, longitudinal-inhomogeneous bianisotropic media. Our proof-of-concept demonstration elucidates the interaction between a nonparaxial Gaussian incident beam with various linear/circular polarizations and a mismatched anisotropic double-negative (DNG) metamaterial. We unveil the nontrivial bifocal effect and optical vortex (OV) generation and focusing phenomena in a three-dimensional environment, findings that have not been documented previously. Significantly, the proposed efficient methodology holds the potential for application in examining more promising physical phenomena exhibited by intricate metamaterials, enabling a more visually rigorous approach.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Mechanical Motions in Non-linear Optical Organic Micro Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional (3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of 2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol) (HDBP), exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) emission and frequency comb-type whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting, transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial precision.</description>

      <title>Frozen differential scattering in reconfigurable complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of transmission to the input wavefront is a hallmark feature of complex media and the basis for wavefront shaping techniques. Yet, intriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is "frozen" (agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the complex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we unveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential scattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media. Specifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix of any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential output signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's coherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential output mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise management. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a rich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then, we demonstrate "customized freezing" by optimizing the configuration of additional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as envisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen differential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio. Potential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential wavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.</description>

      <title>Mapping of discrete range modulated proton radiograph to water-equivalent path length using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Proton beams enable localized dose delivery. Accurate range estimation is essential, but planning still relies on X-ray CT, which introduces uncertainty in stopping power and range. Proton CT measures water equivalent thickness directly but suffers resolution loss from multiple Coulomb scattering. We develop a data driven method that reconstructs water equivalent path length (WEPL) maps from energy resolved proton radiographs, bypassing intermediate reconstructions. Approach. We present a machine learning pipeline for WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS Monte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton energies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component analysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional GAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite loss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and stability. Main results. The model reached a mean relative WEPL deviation of 2.5 percent, an SSIM of 0.97, and a proton radiography gamma index passing rate of 97.1 percent (2 percent delta WEPL, 3 mm distance-to-agreement) on a simulated head phantom. Results indicate high spatial fidelity and strong structural agreement. Significance. WEPL can be mapped directly from proton radiographs with deep learning while avoiding intermediate steps. The method mitigates limits of analytic techniques and may improve treatment planning. Future work will tune the number of PCA components, include detector response, explore low dose settings, and extend multi angle data toward full proton CT reconstruction; it is compatible with clinical workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast, and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, like D-Wave's cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs. Here, we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks, our architecture solves fully-connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings), and $&gt;$41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system leverages cascaded thin-film lithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential $&gt;$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding - benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in optical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a prototype bi-layer piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) based on transferred periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) X-cut lithium niobate (LN). Opposite in-plane polarizations in the piezoelectric film stack are employed to enable efficient lateral field excitation of the flexural mode. Thanks to its high piezoelectric coefficient and low dielectric loss, the X-cut LN exhibits high figure of merits (FoMs) as both sensors and transducers. The fabricated PMUT demonstrates an out-of-plane mode near 1 MHz with an electromechanical coupling of 3.6\%. Laser Doppler vibrometry further validates the finite element analysis, showing a peak center displacement of 340 pm/V. These results establish bi-layer P3F LN PMUTs as a promising platform for compact and high-performance ultrasonic transducers. Future work will focus on theoretical analysis, modeling of the measured data, improving the design of the transducer topology, and mitigating feedthrough effects.</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.</description>

      <title>Phase mask fabrication for multi-plane light conversion using grayscale lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper formally defines the optogeometric factor $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ as a pixel level quantity of geometric optical throughput, with units of $\text{m}^2\cdot\text{sr}$ (or $\text{m}^2$ in reduced form), derived from \'etendue. Whereas \'etendue is conventionally used to characterise the throughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to the level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene radiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel.
  Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is general and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems.
  The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical radiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new contribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level radiometric throughput.
  The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation that already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In that formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present only implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ is made explicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent and general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric throughput.
  Two formulations of $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form, expressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number. They coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-1/2 C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>
