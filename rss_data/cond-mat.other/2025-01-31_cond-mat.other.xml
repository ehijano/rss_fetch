      <title>Dynamics with Simultaneous Dissipations to Fermionic and Bosonic Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-phenomenological framework based on the influence functional method to incorporate simultaneous interactions of particles with fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs. In the slow-motion limit, the electronic friction kernel becomes Markovian, enabling an analytical expression for the friction coefficient. The framework is applied to a prototypical electrochemical system, where the metal electrode and solvent act as fermionic and bosonic reservoirs, respectively. We investigate quantum vibrational relaxation of hydrogen on metal surfaces, showing that dissipation to electron-hole pairs reduces the relaxation time. Additionally, in solvated proton discharge, electronic friction prolongs charge transfer by delaying proton transitions between potential wells. This study provides new insights into the interplay of solvent and electronic dissipation effects, with direct relevance to electrochemical processes and other systems involving multiple thermal reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Equilibrium Topological Order on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin photocurrents in ultrathin topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films. Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations, we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but have $s$-wave and $d$-wave components in regard to transformations under $\pi/2$ rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on these effects.</description>
