      <title>Error bounds for the asymptotic expansions of the Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to derive explicit and computable error bounds for the asymptotic expansion of the Jacobi polynomials as their degree approaches infinity, using an integral method. The analysis focuses on the outer or oscillatory region of these polynomials. A novel technique is introduced to address the challenges posed by the logarithmic singularity in the phase function of the integral representation of Jacobi polynomials. A recurrence formula is also developed to compute the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Coarse and pointwise tangent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alberti, Cs\"ornyei and Preiss introduced a notion of a "pointwise (weak) tangent field" for a subset of Euclidean space -- a field that contains almost every tangent line of every curve passing through the set -- and showed that all area-zero sets in the plane admit one-dimensional tangent fields. We extend their results in two distinct directions. First, a special case of our pointwise result shows that each doubling subset of Hilbert space admits a pointwise tangent field in this sense, with dimension bounded by the Nagata (or Assouad) dimension of the set.
  Second, inspired by the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem of Jones, we introduce new, "coarse" notions of tangent field for subsets of Hilbert space, which take into account both large and small scale structure. We show that doubling subsets of Hilbert space admit such coarse tangent fields, again with dimension bounded by the Nagata (or Assouad) dimension of the set. For porous sets in the plane, this result can be viewed as a quantitative version of the Alberti--Cs\"ornyei--Preiss result, though our results hold in all (even infinite) dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Progressions Inside Sets of Large Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we connect Sobolev estimates in the context of polynomial averages e.g. \[ \| \int_0^1 \prod_{k=1}^m f_k(x-t^k) \|_{1} \leq \text{Const} \cdot 2^{-\text{const} \cdot l} \prod_{i=1}^m \| f_k \|_m \] whenever some $f_i$ vanishes on $\{ |\xi| \leq 2^l \}$ to the existence of polynomial progressions inside of sets of sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, in analogy with work of Peluse in the discrete context. Our strongest (unconditional) result builds off deep work of Hu-Lie is as follows: suppose that $\mathcal{P} = \{P_1,P_2,P_3\}$ vanish at the origin at different rates, and that $E \subset [0,1]$ has sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, \[ 1 - \text{const}(\mathcal{P}) &lt; \text{dim}_H(E) &lt; 1.\] Then $E$ contains a non-trivial polynomial progression of the form \[ \{ x , x - P_1(t), x - P_2(t), x - P_3(t) \} \subset E, \; \; \; t \neq 0. \]</description>

      <title>Dichotomies for triangular systems on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the relationship between the exponential dichotomy properties of a triangular system of linear difference equations and its associated diagonal system on Hilbert spaces. We stress that all previous results in this direction were restricted to the finite-dimensional case. As in the previous work of the first two authors, we rely on the relationship between exponential dichotomies and the so-called admissibility properties. However, this approach requires nontrivial changes when passing from the finite-dimensional to the infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for the formalization of Carleson's theorem on convergence of Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the blueprint underlying the Lean formalization of the proof of Carleson's classical result asserting almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series of continuous functions. We break up the proof into two steps, a reduction of the classical result to a new theorem that appears in a sibling communication and a proof of this new theorem, which is also detailed as blueprint in this paper. An early version of this blueprint was used to initiate the Lean formalization. During the formalization, many contributors elaborated the blueprint with minor corrections, modifications and extensions. The final version is presented here as a guide through the accompanying Lean code.</description>

      <title>A Dilogarithm Series and a Generalization of a Theorem of Bridgeman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Abel's five-term relation, we derive a new two-parameter series identity for the Rogers dilogarithm. By specializing this identity, we obtain dilogarithm series involving Lucas sequences. These results generalize certain series identities of Bridgeman related to solutions of Pell's equations, which were obtained via a completely different approach.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>
