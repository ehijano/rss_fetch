      <title>Approximate Reachable Sets using Singularly Perturbed Differential Games, with Application to Biological System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is an exciting framework used for control of safety-critical systems with nonlinear and possibly uncertain dynamics. However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</description>

      <title>Pesti-Gen: Unleashing a Generative Molecule Approach for Toxicity Aware Pesticide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</description>
