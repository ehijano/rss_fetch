      <title>Three Pillars Towards Next-Generation Routing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The routing results are playing an increasingly important role in transportation efficiency, but they could generate traffic congestion unintentionally. This is because the traffic condition and routing system are disconnected components in the current routing paradigm. In this paper, we propose a next-generation routing paradigm that could reduce traffic congestion by considering the influence of the routing results in real-time. Specifically, we regard the routing results as the root cause of the future traffic flow, which at the same time is identified as the root cause of traffic conditions. To implement such a system, we identify three essential components: 1) the traffic condition simulation that establishes the relation between traffic flow and traffic condition with guaranteed accuracy; 2) the future route management that supports efficient simulation with dynamic route update; 3) the global routing optimization that improves the overall transportation system efficiency. Preliminary design and experimental results will be presented, and the corresponding challenges and research directions will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>A hybrid solution for 2-UAV RAN slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's possible to distribute the Internet to users via drones. However it is then necessary to place the drones according to the positions of the users. Moreover, the 5th Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) technology is designed to accommodate a wide range of applications and industries. The NGNM 5G White Paper \cite{5gwhitepaper} groups these vertical use cases into three categories:
  - enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)
  - massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC)
  - Ultra-Reliable Low-latency Communication (URLLC).
  Partitioning the physical network into multiple virtual networks appears to be the best way to provide a customised service for each application and limit operational costs. This design is well known as \textit{network slicing}. Each drone must thus slice its bandwidth between each of the 3 user classes. This whole problem (placement + bandwidth) can be defined as an optimization problem, but since it is very hard to solve efficiently, it is almost always addressed by AI in the litterature. In my internship, I wanted to prove that viewing the problem as an optimization problem can still be useful, by building an hybrid solution involving on one hand AI and on the other optimization. I use it to achieve better results than approaches that use only AI, although at the cost of slightly larger (but still reasonable) computation times.</description>

      <title>Analysis of flexible traffic control method in SDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze methods of flexible control in SDN networks and to propose a self-developed solution that will enable intelligent adaptation of SDN controller performance. This work aims not only to review existing solutions, but also to develop an approach that will increase the efficiency and adaptability of network management. The project uses a modern type of machine learning, Reinforcement Learning, which allows autonomous decisions of a network that learns based on its choices in a dynamically changing environment, which is most similar to the way humans learn. The solution aims not only to improve the network's performance, but also its flexibility and real-time adaptability - flexible traffic control.</description>

      <title>Age-of-Information and Energy Optimization in Digital Twin Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intricate realm of digital twin synchronization and deployment in multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks, with the aim of optimizing and balancing the two performance metrics Age of Information (AoI) and energy efficiency. We jointly consider the problems of edge association, power allocation, and digital twin deployment. However, the inherent randomness of the problem presents a significant challenge in identifying an optimal solution. To address this, we first analyze the feasibility conditions of the optimization problem. We then examine a specific scenario involving a static channel and propose a cyclic scheduling scheme. This enables us to derive the sum AoI in closed form. As a result, the joint optimization problem of edge association and power control is solved optimally by finding a minimum weight perfect matching. Moreover, we examine the one-shot optimization problem in the contexts of both frequent digital twin migrations and fixed digital twin deployments, and propose an efficient online algorithm to address the general optimization problem. This algorithm effectively reduces system costs by balancing frequent migrations and fixed deployments. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms of low cost and high efficiency.</description>

      <title>CEF: Connecting Elaborate Federal QKD Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As QKD infrastructure becomes increasingly complex while being developed by different actors (typically national governments), interconnecting them into a federated network of very elaborate sub-networks that maintain a high degree of autonomy will pose unique challenges. We identify several such challenges and propose a 4-step orchestration framework to address them based on centralized research, target network planning, optimal QKD design, and protocol enforcement.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled IoV: Secure Communication and Trustworthy Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which enables interactions between vehicles, infrastructure, and the environment, faces challenges in maintaining communication security and reliable automated decisions. This paper introduces a decentralized framework comprising a primary layer for managing inter-vehicle communication and a sub-layer for securing intra-vehicle interactions. By implementing blockchain-based protocols like Blockchain-integrated Secure Authentication (BiSA) and Decentralized Blockchain Name Resolution (DBNR), the framework ensures secure, decentralized identity management and reliable data exchanges, thereby supporting safe and efficient autonomous vehicle operations.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>
