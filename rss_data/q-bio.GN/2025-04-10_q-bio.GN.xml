      <title>An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Debate System for Mendelian Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Mendelian diseases is crucial for precision therapy and assistance in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, existing methods often fall short of clinical standards or depend on extensive datasets to build pretrained machine learning models. To address this, we introduce an innovative LLM-Driven multi-agent debate system (MD2GPS) with natural language explanations of the diagnostic results. It utilizes a language model to transform results from data-driven and knowledge-driven agents into natural language, then fostering a debate between these two specialized agents. This system has been tested on 1,185 samples across four independent datasets, enhancing the TOP1 accuracy from 42.9% to 66% on average. Additionally, in a challenging cohort of 72 cases, MD2GPS identified potential pathogenic genes in 12 patients, reducing the diagnostic time by 90%. The methods within each module of this multi-agent debate system are also replaceable, facilitating its adaptation for diagnosing and researching other complex diseases.</description>

      <title>CiMBA: Accelerating Genome Sequencing through On-Device Basecalling via Compute-in-Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As genome sequencing is finding utility in a wide variety of domains beyond the confines of traditional medical settings, its computational pipeline faces two significant challenges. First, the creation of up to 0.5 GB of data per minute imposes substantial communication and storage overheads. Second, the sequencing pipeline is bottlenecked at the basecalling step, consuming &gt;40% of genome analysis time. A range of proposals have attempted to address these challenges, with limited success. We propose to address these challenges with a Compute-in-Memory Basecalling Accelerator (CiMBA), the first embedded ($\sim25$mm$^2$) accelerator capable of real-time, on-device basecalling, coupled with AnaLog (AL)-Dorado, a new family of analog focused basecalling DNNs. Our resulting hardware/software co-design greatly reduces data communication overhead, is capable of a throughput of 4.77 million bases per second, 24x that required for real-time operation, and achieves 17x/27x power/area efficiency over the best prior basecalling embedded accelerator while maintaining a high accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art software basecallers.</description>

      <title>On-Chip and Off-Chip TIA Amplifiers for Nanopore Signal Readout Design, Performance and Challenges: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in biomedical research have driven continuous innovations in sensing and diagnostic technologies. Among these, nanopore based single molecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile sensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require concomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the point of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current sensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal readout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic capacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies. This review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures classified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design implementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay between noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse transimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on characterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and operational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in prior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance range limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B system to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high speed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance matching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.</description>
