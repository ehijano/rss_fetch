      <title>Gauge-Theoretical Method in Solving Zero-curvature Equations II--Non-Weyl Class Solutions of the Static Einstein-Maxwell Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge-theoretical method introduced in our previous paper is applied to solving the axisymmetric and static Einstein-Maxwell equations. We obtain the solutions of non-Weyl class, where the gravitational and electric or magnetic potentials are not functionally related. In the electrostatic case, we show that the obtained solution coincides with the solution given by Bonnor in 1979. In the magnetostatic case, we present a solution describing the gravitational field created by two magnetically charged masses. In this solution, we show a case where the Dirac string does not stretch to spatial infinity but lies between the magnetically charged masses.</description>

      <title>Alternative Action for Generalized Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), a class of modifications to general relativity characterized by a special partial breaking of general coordinate covariance. The action for this formulation is derived constructively through a sequence of equivalent representations, starting from the original GUMG setup and extending the configuration space and gauge structure by introducing time parametrization. Our approach, based on a canonical formalism, parallels the method used by Henneaux and Teitelboim to covariantize the action of unimodular gravity (UMG), which was generalized to consistently accommodate a parameterization via local fields for the entire GUMG family. For completeness, we explore the dynamical structure of the theory and provide a detailed account of its gauge properties. A notable consequence of the consistent parametrization is the emergence of explicit spatial delocalization in the action, manifestations of which we carefully examine. Within the GUMG family, we identify a subfamily of models described by a local action. While preserving the essential structural features, these models avoid the complications of spatial nonlocality allowing a clearer analysis. The dynamical and constraint structures of GUMG family models are different from those of UMG, however the latter appears as an exceptional special case within the family, providing valuable comparative insights.</description>

      <title>Super-entropic black holes in gravity's rainbow and determining constraints on rainbow functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the application of the inverse isoperimetric inequality to establish constraints on the parameters of gravity's rainbow. We investigate the thermodynamic (in)stability conditions for $d-$dimensional energy-dependent black holes, which are recognized as $d-$ dimensional black holes within the framework of gravity's rainbow. To achieve this, we calculate thermodynamic quantities such as Hawking temperature, entropy, total mass, and heat capacity in both extended and non-extended phase spaces for these black holes. We assess the physical and stable regions by utilizing these thermodynamic quantities alongside the inverse isoperimetric inequality, aiming to determine constraints on the rainbow functions. Finally, we show that by considering a constraint on the rainbow function, these black holes satisfy the super-entropic condition.</description>

      <title>AdS Black String in a Cosmic Web: Geodesics, Shadows, and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article (Ref. \cite{AOP}), the authors obtained a static, cylindrically symmetric Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black string (BS) solutions, which are cylindrical generalizations of black holes (BHs), surrounded by a cloud of strings (CS) and the quintessence field (QF), and discussed its properties. In the present study, we present a comprehensive analysis of cylindrically symmetric AdS BSs surrounded by CS and QF. Our analysis yields several significant results. We demonstrate that the presence of CS (parameter $\alpha$) and QF (parameters $c$ and $w$) reduces the radius of circular photon orbits (CPO) and BH shadow size, with measurements constrained by Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A*. We find that time-like particle orbits show increased energy with higher $\alpha$ and $c$ values. We calculate that C-energy, representing gravitational energy within cylindrical radius, decreases with radial distance but exhibits distinct responses to CS and QF parameters. We observe that scalar perturbation potential increases $r$ for specific $\alpha$ and $c$ values, indicating stronger field-spacetime interactions away from the BS. We determine that Hawking temperature increases linearly with Schwarzschild radius, with parameter-dependent behavior varying based on QF state parameter $w$. These results demonstrate how CS and QF significantly modify the geodesic, perturbative, and thermodynamic properties of AdS BS, with potential observational implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics, and BH evaporation signatures in future astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>The Constraints on the SGWB from Cosmic Strings by a HFGW Electromagnetic Resonance System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the primary detection targets for contemporary gravitational wave (GW) observatories, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the early universe's formation and evolution. Studies indicate that the SGWB spectrum from cosmic strings can span an extraordinarily broad frequency range, extending from extremely low frequencies up to the microwave band. This work specifically investigates the detectability of cosmic string SGWB signals in an electromagnetic (EM) resonance system at GHz frequency. We present a systematic analysis encompassing: (1) the response of high frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) in such EM resonance system. (2) the development and application of fundamental data processing protocols in the EM resonance system. Our results demonstrate that the EM system shows promising sensitivity to detect cosmic string SGWB signals with tension parameters $G\mu\geq 10^{-10}$, while potentially establishing new constraints for $G\mu\leq 10^{-10}$ in the microwave band. These findings would complement existing multi-band SGWB observations and provide additional constraints on cosmic-string tension parameters in GHz frequency regimes.</description>

      <title>Light deflection in unified gravity and measurable deviation from general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light, though massless, does not travel in a perfectly straight line when it passes near a massive object. Instead, it follows the curvature of spacetime - a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, occurs because massive bodies like stars, galaxies, or black holes distort the fabric of spacetime around them, bending the path of light much like a lens bends rays in optics. In this work, we study gravitational lensing using the gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] based on four one-dimensional unitary gauge symmetries and formulated as a quantum field theory in the Minkowski spacetime extending the Standard Model to include gravity. The dynamical equation of light in unified gravity contains explicit coupling to the gravity gauge field whereas, in general relativity, gravitational coupling is only implicitly described through the metric. Despite this fundamental difference, unified gravity can be used to calculate the curved metric of the locally measurable spacetime and to obtain the observable deflection of light near astrophysical objects. Without a single free parameter, perfect agreement between unified gravity and general relativity is obtained for the deflection angle of light in the first power of the gravitational constant. However, the second-order contribution to the deflection angle reveals a measurable relative difference of $1/15\approx6.7$% between the predictions of unified gravity and general relativity. Therefore, detailed observations of gravitational lensing or gravitational wave data are expected to enable experimentally differentiating between the two theories in the near future, thus revealing the profound symmetry principles of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin precession from massive black holes binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned from high-mass systems. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio but different signal-to-noise ratios, total masses, and extrinsic angles, which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, $\rho\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the {\sc NRSur7dq4} waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) is visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\rho\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with 2-3 observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</description>

      <title>The Luminosity of the Darkness: Schechter function in dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a novel avenue for probing the Universe. One of their exciting applications is the independent measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, using dark standard sirens, which combine GW signals with galaxy catalogues considering that GW events are hosted by galaxies. However, due to the limited reach of telescopes, galaxy catalogues are incomplete at high redshifts. The commonly used GLADE+ is complete only up to redshift $z=0.1$, necessitating a model accounting for the galaxy luminosity distribution accounting for the selection function of galaxies, typically described by the Schechter function. In this paper, we examine the influence of the Schechter function model on dark sirens, focusing on its redshift evolution and its impact on $H_0$ and rate parameters measurements. We find that neglecting the evolution of the Schechter function can influence the prior in redshift on GWs, which has particularly high impact for distant GW events with limited galaxy catalogue support. Moreover, conducting a joint estimation of $H_0$ and the rate parameters, we find that allowing them to vary fixes the bias in $H_0$ but the rate parameter $\gamma$ depends on the evolving Schechter function. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolving Schechter function to account for changes in galaxy populations over cosmic time, as this impacts rate parameters to which $H_0$ is sensitive.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxy Surveys with Hybrid SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the computational cost of running simulations that can describe the increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory (PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses, thus demonstrating the efficacy of this approach to maximally extract information from upcoming spectroscopic datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below and thus to raise many questions regarding the definition of the gravitational path integral. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. However, we show here that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation: compact slices without boundary, asymptotically flat, or asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter slices. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory, which have peculiarities due to the nonlinear large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry. Notably, we find that the $S^3 \times S^3$ angular momentum spectrum of BPS states in the Ramond sector exhibits discrete jumps as a function of the ratio between the radii of the two three-spheres. This phenomenon is a quantum gravity effect for which no microscopic derivation is currently known. In addition, we construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetric index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with $AdS_2 \times S^2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star crust to perturbative-QCD densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a "pQCD likelihood," and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a "unified" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</description>

      <title>A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy cluster catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result. This exploratory work paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves, algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality relation in holographic thermal CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. In turn, we explain the interplay between the algebraic structure of black hole spacetimes and their associated dualities. For large classes of black hole geometries, explicit constructions are presented. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), discussing how such dualities place stringent constraints on the thermal spectra of correlators. In particular, the dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs. A number of numerical results supporting our conclusions is also presented, including a demonstration of how the longitudinal spectrum of quasinormal modes determines the transverse spectrum, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Strings and near-extremal black holes in theories with large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-loop partition function of superstrings in the $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathbf{S}^3 \times \mathbf{S}^3 \times \mathbf{S}^1$ background. Specifically, we show that the supergravity spectrum, which contains non-chiral primary states unlike other similar $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ backgrounds, can be recovered by this partition function in the semiclassical limit. We also show how the boundary currents are encoded in the string spectrum. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of these boundary currents in the quantum partition function of near-extremal black holes in theories with large $\mathcal{N} = (4,4)$ supersymmetry, recovering results consistent with the analysis of the near-horizon (super-)Schwarzian theory. In particular, we show how the BPS index of the large $\mathcal{N} = (4,4)$ theory, which turns out to be temperature dependent, captures the spectrum of excitations around supersymmetric BTZ black holes. Finally, we comment on the limit when the AdS curvature radius is string scale, which is directly accessible within the RNS formalism for this compactification. The spectrum of the limiting theory we obtain differs from the tensionless string spectrum derived in the literature, suggesting that there is not a unique worldsheet CFT for this value of parameters.</description>

Abstract: We argue that there exists an operational way to establish the observability of the notions of space and time. Specifically, we propose a theory-independent protocol for a gedanken-experiment, whose outcome is a signal establishing the observability of the spacetime manifold, without a priori assuming its existence. The experimental signal contains the information about the dimension and the topology of spacetime (with the currently achievable precision), and establishes its manifold structure, while respecting its underlying diffeomorphism symmetry. We also introduce and discuss appropriate criteria for the concept of emergence of spacetime, which any tentative theoretical model of physics must satisfy in order to claim that spacetime does emerge from some more fundamental concepts.</description>

Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group-Improved Gravitational Action: A Lagrangian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach for embedding the renormalization group running of Newton's constant and cosmological constant in gravity is proposed. This approach is based on a gravitational Lagrangian that gives rise to a new class of modified gravity theories where $G$ and $\Lambda$ are spacetime-dependent functions. The Lagrangian formulation can be interpreted as an effective gravitational action that encapsulates the scale dependence of $G$ and $\Lambda$, arising from quantum effects in the early universe. We show that the new formalism can be discussed using partially the framework and results of Horndeski modified gravity, excluding the equations of motion of the scalar field. The study explores aspects of this new gravity action. We also analyze an interesting non-singular cosmological solution featuring power-law inflation and we discuss the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations within this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of the torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and show that the gravitational action is given by a topological charge.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Einstein Static Universe in Zero-Point Length Cosmology with Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, zero-point length cosmology has shown some positive insights into some non-singular aspects of the early Universe. In addition, topological defects are known to play a significant role by its presence as a part of the total energy in the very early Universe. We investigate the stability issue of the Einstein static phase in the emergent scenario of the Universe in a generalized framework of zero-point length cosmology in the presence of topological defects in the very early times. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, where the matter sector includes an extra energy density term arising from $n$-dimensional topological defects. We have studied the possibility of graceful exit of emergent scenario and its stability using dynamical system analysis and against homogeneous scalar perturbation. We also analysed the stability against inhomogeneous density perturbation, vector perturbation and tensor perturbation. Through the stability analysis, it has been shown that the model parameters associated with zero-point length setting and $n$-dimensional topological defects play a visible role in the phase transition process from the ESU to the inflationary regime. Also, interestingly it is found that there exists a mutual interplay between the zero-point length parameter, and the dimension of topological defect on the stability of the ESU on the basis of inhomogeneous density perturbation. Finally, the stability is also tested against vector and tensor perturbation, which shows that the ESU is stable against such perturbations.</description>

      <title>Novel inner shadows of the Kerr black hole with a tilted thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is regarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and constraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted accretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship between the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the case of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum inner shadow size of $S_{\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the black hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\circ}$ and the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the inner shadow exhibits novel configurations -- taking on petal, crescent, or eyebrow shapes -- significantly smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ across various parameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to the accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a diagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion disk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain parameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which could also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence -- I: Thermodynamics, Geodesics and Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frolov black hole (BH) is a charged extension of the Hayward BH, having regularity at the central point $r = 0$ and an asymptotically Schwarzschild form for large values of $r$. Such a BH is parameterized by a length scale parameter, \( \alpha_0 \). In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamic properties, null and timelike geodesics, and shadows of a Frolov BH immersed in a quintessence field. Our results indicate that the smaller BH is locally thermodynamically stable yet globally unstable at all horizon radii. Neither the quintessence parameter nor the other model parameters like the charge $q$ and length scale parameter $\alpha_0$ change this global instability. We extend the study of the null and timelike geodesics to the vicinity of the BH by analyzing how the geodesic motion depends on the model parameters. Finally, we analyze the shadow of the BH system and find that the shadow radii are sensitively dependent on model parameters. In contrast, the influence of the quintessence parameter itself on the size of the shadow is found to be rather weak.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neural Network Surrogate Models: Application to Black Hole Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models of numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes provide the most accurate tools for gravitational-wave data analysis. Neural network-based surrogates promise evaluation speedups, but their accuracy relies on (often obscure) tuning of settings such as the network architecture, hyperparameters, and the size of the training dataset. We propose a systematic optimization strategy that formalizes setting choices and motivates the amount of training data required. We apply this strategy on NRSur7dq4Remnant, an existing surrogate model for the properties of the remnant of generically precessing binary black hole mergers and construct a neural network version, which we label NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN. The systematic optimization strategy results in a new surrogate model with comparable accuracy, and provides insights into the meaning and role of the various network settings and hyperparameters as well as the structure of the physical process. Moreover, NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN results in evaluation speedups of up to $8$ times on a single CPU and a further improvement of $2,000$ times when evaluated in batches on a GPU. To determine the training set size, we propose an iterative enrichment strategy that efficiently samples the parameter space using much smaller training sets than naive sampling. NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN requires $O(10^4)$ training data, so neural network-based surrogates are ideal for speeding-up models that support such large training datasets, but at the moment cannot directly be applied to numerical relativity catalogs that are $O(10^3)$ in size. The optimization strategy is available through the gwbonsai package.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) through Gedankenexperiments involving black hole perturbations induced by test particles. Our approach allows for the calculation of perturbations to any order for a general class of black holes that admit the zero-temperature extremal limit. We find that the WCCC for extremal and near-extremal black holes is hinged upon the positive sign of only one quantity, namely $W=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{Q_\alpha ; T=0}$, which is indeed positive for all the well-known black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar standing gravitational waves in the linear approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar cylindrical standing gravitational waves correspond to two different classes of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations. Both families satisfy the definition of standing gravitational waves proposed by Stephani, but only the latter class fulfills the stricter definition introduced by Chandrasekhar. The aim of this research is to compare both classes of solutions within the linear regime. We discover that the linearized Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar standing waves are gravitational analogues of two different types of electromagnetic polarization standing waves.</description>

      <title>Particle Deflections around Microscopic Loop Quantum Black Holes with Rigorous Quantum Parameters</title>

Abstract: The detection of quantum gravity effects is highly limited in both macroscopic and microscopic scenarios: The small quantum parameter makes most large-scale observations practically indistinguishable from general relativity. While at the Planck scale, where the effect of quantum gravity is undoubtedly significant, the energy requirement is remarkably high for any test particle as a probe. In this work, by focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of both massless and massive particles around a microscopic loop quantum black hole, we show that given the current knowledge of ultra-high-energy particles, quantum corrections of relative scale $&gt;10^{-10}$ can appear when the radius of the black hole horizon remains larger than the wavelength of high-energy Gamma rays, where the classical photon trajectory may still hold to a certain degree. In addition, more significant corrections can be observed when considering low velocity massive particles. Potentially, our results could suggest a new area for testing the effects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to a discussion regarding the role of Barrow's ''Zero Universes'' in quantum cosmology. In particular, we demonstrate that if quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model, then the mere presence of the universes with a zero scale factor (the ``Zero universes'') produces a veritably remarkable outcome: the classical cosmological singularities of Big Bang, Big Crunch and Big Rip all fail to arise. In other words, those universes that are considered ill-posed at the classical level may turn out to be a necessary and sought-after ingredient in a future internally consistent quantum theory of gravity. Finally, we argue that the MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries; for example, it might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes there. In addition, the new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEC preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Butterfly velocity and chaos suppression in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the holographic CFT in the de Sitter static patch at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential. We find that butterfly velocity $v_B$ in such field theory degenerates for all values of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $T$. We interpret this as a chaos disruption caused by the interplay between the expansion of chaotic correlations constrained by $v_B$ and effects caused by de Sitter curvature. The chemical potential restores healthy butterfly velocity for some range of temperatures. Also, we provide some analogy of this chaos suppression with the Schwinger effect in de Sitter and black hole formation from shock wave collision.</description>

      <title>Irreversible vierbein postulate: Emergence of spacetime from quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a model for quantum gravity based on the local Lorentz symmetry and general coordinate invariance. A key idea is the irreversible vierbein postulate that a tree-level action for the model at a certain energy scale does not contain an inverse vierbein. Under this postulate, only the spinor becomes a dynamical field, and no gravitational background field is introduced in the tree-level action. In this paper, after explaining the transformation rules of the local Lorentz and general-coordinate transformations in detail, a tree-level action is defined. We show that fermionic fluctuations can induce a nonvanishing gravitational background field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that a $dS_{d+1}$ spacetime of radius $R_{ds}$ has a holographic dual, living at future space-like infinity ${\cal I}^+$, with the bulk wave function being dual to the partition function of the boundary theory, [arXiv:astro-ph/0210603v5]. We consider some aspects of this correspondence. For under damped scalars with mass $M^2R_{ds}^2&gt;{d^2\over4}$, belonging to the principal series, we show that for the Bunch Davies vacuum a suitable source in the boundary theory can be identified in terms of the coherent state representation of the wave function. We argue that terms in the resulting correlation functions, which are independent of the late time cut-off, satisfy the Ward identities of a conformal field theory. We also discuss other ways to identify sources, both in the under damped and the over damped case, where $M^2R_{ds}^2&lt;{d^2\over4}$, and argue that these too can lead to correlators satisfying the Ward identities of a CFT. Some comments on the violation of reflection positivity, and the cut-off dependent terms, along with some explicit checks and sample calculations, are also included.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven likelihood-free parameter inference for 21-cm forest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in spectra of high-redshift radio sources, known collectively as the 21-cm forest, have been demonstrated as a sensitive probe to the small-scale structures governed by the dark matter (DM) properties, as well as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium regulated by the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. By statistically analyzing these spectral features, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can effectively break the parameter degeneracies and constrain the properties of both DM and the first galaxies. However, conventional parameter inference methods face challenges due to computationally expensive simulations for 21-cm forest and the non-Gaussian signal characteristics. To address these issues, we introduce generative normalizing flows for data augmentation and inference normalizing flows for parameters estimation. This approach efficiently estimates parameters from minimally simulated datasets with non-Gaussian signals. Using simulated data from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we demonstrate the ability of the deep learning-driven likelihood-free approach to generate accurate posterior distributions, providing a robust and efficient tool for probing DM and the cosmic heating history using the 1D power spectrum of 21-cm forest in the era of SKA. This methodology is adaptable for scientific analyses with other unevenly distributed data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ER=EPR conjecture states that quantum entanglement between boundary degrees of freedom leads to the emergence of bulk spacetime itself. Although this has been tested extensively in String Theory for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, its implications for an accelerating universe, such as our own, remain less explored. Assuming a cosmic version of ER=EPR for de Sitter space, we explore computational complexity corresponding to long-range entanglement responsible for bulk states on spacelike hypersurfaces. Rather remarkably, we find that the complexity (per unit volume) of the Euclidean vacuum, as an entangled state over two boundary CFT vacua, is finite both in the UV and the IR, which provides additional evidence for cosmic ER=EPR. Our result seems to be a universal feature of spacetimes with horizons and, moreover, hints at new features of the thermofield double state for studying thermalization of any quantum system.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy.
  As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity.
  This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the Solar System via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the Solar System. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the Solar System. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution of cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the standard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the kinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. Apart from the usual terms arising from angular aberration and flux boosting, there is a contribution from the boosting of the redshifts that becomes important when considering a sample selected on observed redshift, leading to non-vanishing correction terms. We discuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift selection functions. We also discuss the effect of redshift measurement uncertainties in this context, in particular in upcoming surveys for which we provide estimates of the correction terms. Depending on the shape of a sample's redshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms can become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is reversed. Lastly, we discuss how cuts on variables correlated with observed redshift, such as color, can induce additional correction terms.</description>

Abstract: Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong gravitational lensing (SGL) system RXJ1131-1231 and constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) via the distance sum rule, without assuming a specific cosmological model. For $\Omega_K = 0$, we obtain $H_0 = 73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by breaking the mass-sheet transform using lens galaxy's mass models and stellar kinematics, respectively. Allowing $\Omega_K$ to vary increases the central value of $H_0$ and reduces its precision. We find that GW dark sirens have significant potential for calibrating SGL systems, due to their relatively higher redshifts. By combining 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain an $H_0$ constraint with a precision approximately $40\%$ better than the measurement from GW170817 using the Hubble law. This suggests that high-precision, model-independent $H_0$ measurements can be achieved with this method as the redshift range of GW dark sirens expands, even without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>The phase of the gravitational path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>
