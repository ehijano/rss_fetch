      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Cooling with a Tripod Structure in a Hyperfine Trapped Ion with Mixed-Species Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling of atomic motion is a crucial tool for many branches of atomic physics, ranging from fundamental physics explorations to quantum information and sensing. For trapped ions, electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling has received attention for the relative speed, low laser power requirements, and broad cooling bandwidth of the technique. However, in applications where the ion used for cooling has hyperfine structure to enable long coherence times, it is difficult to find a closed three-level system in which to perform standard EIT cooling. Here, we demonstrate successful EIT cooling on 25Mg+ by the addition of an extra laser frequency; this method can be applied to any ion with non-zero nuclear spin. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous EIT cooling of all axial modes in mixed-species crystals 9Be+ - 25Mg+ and 9Be+ - 25Mg+ - 9Be+ through the 25Mg+ ion.</description>

      <title>A Customizable Modular Control System for Ultracold Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implemented a control system for ultracold atom experiments. The system includes hardware modules that generate synchronized experiment signals of different kinds, and a protocol to communicate with all the modules. We also implemented software that can automatically generate experiment sequences from declarative tables of parameters with variations. Both the hardware and the software are open-source for adaptation and customization in other experiment platforms.</description>

      <title>Integral equation approach for a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field is a notorious example of a quantum system that has genuinely different asymptotic behaviors in different directions. In the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field the motion is quadratically confined, while in the direction along the field line the motion is a Coulomb-distorted free motion. In this work, we identify the asymptotically relevant parts of the Hamiltonian and cast the problem into a Lippmann-Schwinger form. Then, we approximate the asymptotically irrelevant parts by a discrete Hilbert space basis that allows an exact analytic evaluation of the relevant Green's operators by continued fractions. The total asymptotic Green's operator is calculated by a complex contour integral of subsystem Green's operators. We present a sample of numerical results for a wide range of magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Electron rescollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows a clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference in $\omega + 2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of the electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flip occurs at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV, and this shift corresponds to an inelastic scattering process. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that the shift of the electron kinetic energy at which the asymmetry flip occurs corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and indicates contributions of electron recollisional excitation to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetization oscillations in a periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the magnetization in an Ising chain subjected to a slowly rotating transverse field. The magnetization oscillations are found to be explained by the contributions from different particle excitations in the quantum $E_8$ model. We study the magnetization in the frequency domain in detail, uncovering a series of singular peaks for the $z$ (Ising) component. These singular peaks are split into two sets for the magnetization along $x$ and $y$ directions with frequency shifts set by the rotational-field frequency. The peaks include both $\delta$-function type and edge-singularity type peaks. The $\delta$-function peaks can be attributed to particle excitations involving an $E_8$ particle with either the vacuum or a different particle. The edge-singularity peaks are contributed by particle excitations of two $E_8$ particles with either the vacuum or another particle, or by particle excitations that contain two sets of two particles with each set including at least a particle of the same type. We propose a Rydberg qubit array for possible experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Fast, low-loss all-optical phase modulation in warm rubidium vapour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-loss high-speed switches are an integral component of future photonic quantum technologies, with applications in state generation, multiplexing, and the implementation of quantum gates. Phase modulation is one method of achieving this switching, but existing optical phase modulators either achieve high bandwidth or low loss, but not both. We demonstrate fast ($100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ bandwidth), low-loss ($83\pm2\%$ transmission) phase shifting ($\Delta\phi = (0.90\pm0.05)\pi$) in a signal field, induced by a control field, and mediated by the two-photon $5S_{1/2} \rightarrow{} 5P_{3/2} \rightarrow{} 5D_{5/2}$ transition in $^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapour. We discuss routes to enhance both performance and scalability for application to a range of quantum and classical technologies.</description>

      <title>Erasure-cooling, control, and hyper-entanglement of motion in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how motional degrees of freedom in optical tweezers can be used as quantum information carriers. To this end, we first implement a species-agnostic cooling mechanism via conversion of motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location -- reminiscent of Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We find that this cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate in specific scenarios. By coherently manipulating the motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers, and utilize this to generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits. This work shows how controlling motion enriches the toolbox of quantum information processing with neutral atoms, and opens unique prospects for metrology enhanced by mid-circuit readout and a large class of quantum operations enabled via hyper-entanglement.</description>

      <title>Towards the "puzzle" of Chromium dimer Cr$_2$: predicting the Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>

      <title>Terawatt-level three-stage pulse compression for all-attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of terawatt (TW) near-single-cycle laser pulses is of high interest for applications including attosecond science. Here we demonstrate a three-stage post-compression scheme in a non-guided geometry using He as the nonlinear medium, resulting in the generation of multi-mJ pulses with a duration of 3.7 fs. Key features of this approach are its simplicity, robustness and high stability, making it ideally suited for highly demanding applications such as attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy (APAPS). This is demonstrated by performing two-color APAPS in Ar and Ne, where both simultaneous and sequential two-photon absorption are observed. Our approach is scalable to multi-TW powers.</description>
