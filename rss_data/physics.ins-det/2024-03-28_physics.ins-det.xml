      <title>Development and property study of the extremely thin 12 \texorpdfstring{$\mu m$} C-type straw tubes with 5-mm diameter for a Straw Tracker System of COMET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COMET experiment focuses on searching for the direct conversion of a muon into an electron with aluminum nuclei, without emitting a neutrino (so called $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion). This conversion violates charged lepton flavor conservation law, a fundamental principle in the Standard Model. The COMET experiment requirement is to achieve the muon-to-electron conversation sensitivity better than $10^{-17}$. The Straw Tracker System (STS) based on straw tubes could provide the necessary spatial resolution of 100 $\mu$m and the electron momentum resolution better than 100 MeV/c
  The COMET phase-II will operate with 56 kW 8 GeV proton beam increasing from 3.2 kW 8GeV proton beam proposed for COMET phase-I. The 10-mm straws system was developed for COMET-phase-I and wouldn't perform with full efficiency with 20 times increased intensity. New STT design based on 5-mm 12-$\mu$m thick straws could satisfy the requirement of increased intensity. This detector should also operate in vacuum with 1 bar internal pressure. The mechanical properties of these straws such as sagging, elongation, dependence of the diameter on over-pressure, etc are discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>Low radioactivity techniques for Large TPCs in rare event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of rare phenomena requires an effective suppression of all the background components entangling the expected signal. This has compelled the development of a wide range of low radioactivity techniques and background mitigation strategies. Some examples of those applied to Large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) will be discussed here, including the operation of experiments deep underground, the exhaustive control of material radiopurity and the implementation of discrimination techniques.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Near-Epithermal Neutron Reflective Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specular reflection of neutrons on material surfaces has been demonstrated in the energy range of 0.09-0.7 eV. The results suggest that the applicable energy range of reflective neutron optics can be extended to the near-epithermal region by using existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Frequency Stable Microwave Sapphire Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that state-of-the-art phase noise and high frequency stability could be simultaneously achieved in a microwave oscillator based on the sapphire-loaded cavity resonator. The 9 GHz sapphire oscillator was constructed with the SSB phase noise close to -170 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 10 kHz and fractional frequency instability less than 2 10$^{-13}$ for integration times from 5 to 50 s. In this work, we focus on the technique for phase-referencing the microwave sapphire oscillator to a stable radio-frequency source. We also discuss the suppression of the fast phase fluctuations of the microwave signal due to its transmission through the high-Q resonator.</description>

      <title>Power-to-Frequency Conversion in Cryogenic Sapphire Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied how the cryogenic sapphire resonator responds to fast variations of the dissipated microwave power. The experiments were carried out with sapphire resonators cooled to 6 K at frequencies around 11 GHz. We found that the power-to-frequency conversion of the resonator depends on Fourier frequency as the transfer function of the 1st-order low-pass filter with corner frequency close to the resonator loaded half-bandwidth. Having measured the power-to-frequency conversion of the cryogenic sapphire resonator, we predicted the phase noise of the microwave oscillator based on such resonator.</description>

      <title>Directional detection of keV proton and carbon recoils with MIMAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directional detection is the dedicated strategy to demonstrate that DM-like signals measured by direct detectors are indeed produced by DM particles from the galactic halo. The experimental challenge of measuring the direction of DM-induced nuclear recoils with (sub-)millimeter tracks has limited, so far, the maximal directional reach to DM masses around $100~\rm{GeV}$. In this paper, we expose the MIMAC detector to three different neutron fields and we develop a method to reconstruct the direction of the neutron-induced nuclear recoils. We measure an angular resolution better than $16^\circ$ for proton recoils down to a kinetic energy of $4~\rm{keV}$ and for carbon recoils down to a kinetic energy of $5.5~\rm{keV}$. For the first time, a detector achieves the directional measurement of proton and carbon recoils with kinetic energies in the keV range without any restriction on the direction of the incoming particle. This work demonstrates that directional detection is around the corner for probing DM with masses down to $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{GeV})$.</description>

      <title>Determination of impact parameter for CEE with digi-input neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact parameter characterizes the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collision geometry. The determination of impact parameters in real experiments is usually based on the reconstructed particle attributes or the derived event-level observables. For the scheduled Cooler-storage-ring External-target Experiment (CEE), the low beam energy reduces correlation between the impact parameter and charged particle multiplicity, which decreases the validity of the explicit determination methods. This work investigates a few neural network-based models that directly take the digitized signals from the external Time-of-flight detectors as input. The model with the best performance shows a mean absolute error of 0.479 fm with simulated U-U collisions at 0.5 AGeV. The performances of the models implemented with digi inputs are compared with reference models with phase space inputs, showing the capability of neural networks to handle the original but potentially interrelated digitized signal information.</description>
