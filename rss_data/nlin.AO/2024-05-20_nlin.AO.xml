      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Asynchronous Multi-agent Systems with Self-Triggered Coordinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributed model predictive control for an asynchronous nonlinear multi-agent system with external interference via a self-triggered generator and a prediction horizon regulator. First, a shrinking constraint related to the error between the actual state and the predicted state is introduced into the optimal control problem to enable the robustness of the system. Then, the trigger interval and the corresponding prediction horizon are determined by altering the expression of the Lyapunov function, thus achieving a trade-off between control performance and energy loss. By implementing the proposed algorithm, the coordination objective of the multi-agent system is achieved under asynchronous communication. Finally, the recursive feasibility and stability are proven successively. An illustrative example is conducted to demonstrate the merits of the presented approach.</description>

      <title>Self-Triggered Distributed Model Predictive Control with Synchronization Parameters Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an aperiodic distributed model predictive control approach for multi-agent systems (MASs) in which parameterized synchronization constraints is considered and an innovative self-triggered criterion is constructed. Different from existing coordination methodology, the proposed strategy achieves the cooperation of agents through the synchronization of one-dimensional parameters related to the control inputs. At each asynchronous sampling instant, each agent exchanges the one-dimensional synchronization parameters, solves the optimal control problem (OCP) and then determines the open-loop phase. The incorporation of the selftriggered scheme and the synchronization parameter constraints relieves the computational and communication usage. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the recursive feasibility of the OCP and the stability of the closed-loop system are proven. Simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal input reverberation and homeostatic self-organization towards the edge of synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient or partial synchronization can be used to do computations, although a fully synchronized network is frequently related to epileptic seizures. Here, we propose a homeostatic mechanism that is capable of maintaining a neuronal network at the edge of a synchronization transition, thereby avoiding the harmful consequences of a fully synchronized network. We model neurons by maps since they are dynamically richer than integrate-and-fire models and more computationally efficient than conductance-based approaches. We first describe the synchronization phase transition of a dense network of neurons with different tonic spiking frequencies coupled by gap junctions. We show that at the transition critical point, inputs optimally reverberate through the network activity through transient synchronization. Then, we introduce a local homeostatic dynamic in the synaptic coupling and show that it produces a robust self-organization toward the edge of this phase transition. We discuss the potential biological consequences of this self-organization process, such as its relation to the Brain Criticality hypothesis, its input processing capacity, and how its malfunction could lead to pathological synchronization.</description>
