      <title>Imprint of 'local opacity' effect in gamma-ray spectrum of blazar jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from accreting supermassive black holes at cosmological distances can be powerful emitters of $\gamma$-rays. However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $\gamma$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $\gamma$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $\gamma$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $\gamma$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $\gamma$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.</description>

      <title>Electron heating in high Mach number collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy partition in high Mach number collisionless shock waves is central to a wide range of high-energy astrophysical environments. We present a new theoretical model for electron heating that accounts for the energy exchange between electrons and ions at the shock. The fundamental mechanism relies on the difference in inertia between electrons and ions, resulting in differential scattering of the particles off a decelerating magnetically-dominated microturbulence across the shock transition. We show that the self-consistent interplay between the resulting ambipolar-type electric field and diffusive transport of electrons leads to efficient heating in the magnetic field produced by the Weibel instability in the high-Mach number regime and is consistent with fully kinetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating IceCube neutrinos with a large set of galaxy samples around redshift z ~ 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino telescope has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, but the sources of this flux have largely remained elusive. Using the 10-year IceCube public dataset, we search for correlations between neutrino events and tracers of large-scale structure (LSS). We conduct a combined cross-correlation analysis using several wide-area galaxy catalogs spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 to z ~ 2.5 as well as maps of the cosmic infrared background. We do not detect a definitive signal, but find tantalizing hints of a potential positive correlation between neutrinos and the tracers of LSS. We additionally construct a simple model to interpret galaxy-neutrino cross-correlations in terms of the redshift distribution of neutrino sources. We put upper limits on the clustering amplitude of neutrinos based on the measured cross-correlations with galaxies and forecast the improvements on these constraints that can be obtained using future detectors. We show that, in the future, neutrino-galaxy cross-correlations should be a powerful probe to constrain properties of neutrino source populations.</description>

      <title>A SN Ia Near a Globular Cluster in the Early-Type Galaxy NGC 5353</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No progenitor of a Type Ia supernova is known, but in old population early-type galaxies, one may find SN Ia associated with globular clusters, yielding a population age and metallicity. It also provides insight into the formation path and the SN enhancement rate in globular clusters. We sought to find such associations and identified SN 2019ein to be within the ground-based optical positional uncertainty of a globular cluster candidate within the early-type galaxy NGC 5353 at about 30 Mpc distance. We reduced the positional uncertainties by obtaining Hubble Space Telescope images with the Advanced Camera for Surveys, using filters F475W and F814W and obtained in June 2020. We find that the globular cluster candidate has a magnitude, color, and angular extent that are consistent with it being a typical globular cluster. The separation between the globular cluster and SN 2019ein is 0.43'', or 59 pc in projection. The chance occurrence with a random globular cluster is about 3%, favoring but not proving an association. If the SN progenitor originated in the globular cluster, one scenario is that SN 2019ein was previously a double degenerate white dwarf binary that was dynamically ejected from the globular cluster and exploded within 10 Myr; models do not predict this to be common. Another, but less likely scenario is where the progenitor remained bound to the globular cluster, allowing the double degenerate binary to inspiral on a much longer timescale before producing a SN.</description>

      <title>The proper way to spatially decompose the gravitational-wave origin in stellar collapse simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I discuss the possible misleading interpretation based on the incorrect method in the literature that favors the dominant contribution by the PNS convective layer. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method. This work re-emphasizes the global emission picture of GWs from PNS and motivates future prudent analyses with 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Are all models wrong? Falsifying binary formation models in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the catalogue of gravitational-wave transients grows, several entries appear "exceptional" within the population. Tipping the scales with a total mass of $\approx 150 M_\odot$, GW190521 likely contained black holes in the pair-instability mass gap. The event GW190814, meanwhile, is unusual for its extreme mass ratio and the mass of its secondary component. A growing model-building industry has emerged to provide explanations for such exceptional events, and Bayesian model selection is frequently used to determine the most informative model. However, Bayesian methods can only take us so far. They provide no answer to the question: does our model provide an adequate explanation for the data? If none of the models we are testing provide an adequate explanation, then it is not enough to simply rank our existing models - we need new ones. In this paper, we introduce a method to answer this question with a frequentist $p$-value. We apply the method to different models that have been suggested to explain GW190521: hierarchical mergers in active galactic nuclei and globular clusters. We show that some (but not all) of these models provide adequate explanations for exceptionally massive events like GW190521.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency, wideband study of an active repeater, FRB 20240114A, with the GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a total of 135 bursts from a recently discovered active, repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20240114A with the GMRT over a frequency range of 300$-$750 MHz. The bursts were detected with intrinsic widths ranging from 0.308 to 39.364 ms, a median scattering timescale of 2.059 ms at 400 MHz and 1.372 ms at 650 MHz. The fluences of the detected bursts range from 36.81 mJy ms to 7.47 Jy ms. Both the energy and waiting time distributions of the bursts can be fitted with broken power laws, indicating the presence of two distinct populations of bursts. The energy distributions were modeled via broken power law with $\alpha_{1} = -0.62 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{2} = -1.98 \pm 0.1$, while the waiting time distribution was modeled via a broken power law with $\alpha_{1} = -0.71 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{2} = -2.09 \pm 0.09$. Both the energy and waiting time distributions of FRB 20240114A are comparable to high-energy bursts from magnetars, and giant radio pulses from pulsars, indicating that such objects could be likely progenitors.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on observations from the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), an analysis of Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed during the outburst of the new black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 in 2023 was conducted. This analysis scrutinized the QPO's evolution throughout the outburst, particularly noting its rapid frequency escalation during two flare events. Utilizing the energy range covered by Insight-HXMT, a dependency of the QPO frequency on energy was observed. Below approximately 3 Hz, minimal variations in frequency with energy were noted, whereas clear variations with photon energy were observed when it exceeded approximately 3 Hz. Additionally, a sharp drop in the rate of change was observed when the frequency exceeded approximately 8 Hz. This behavior, similar to several previously reported sources, suggests the presence of a common underlying physical mechanism. Moreover, the QPO rms-frequency relationship can be explained by the Lense-Thirring precession model. The relationship between rms-energy and phase lag with frequency suggests the black hole system as a high-inclination source.</description>

      <title>General relativistic magnetohydodynamics simulations for binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers used to be the most promising candidate for gravitational waves for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as advanced LIGO and advanced VIRGO. This was proved by the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in 2017. Numerical modeling is pivotal in predicting and interpreting binary neutron star mergers. This chapter reviews the progress of fully general relativistic magnetized binary neutron star merger simulations. From 2008 to 2024, about forty numerical relativity simulations of magnetized binary neutron star mergers were conducted with a different level of sophistication. This chapter aims to comprehensively view the magnetohydrodynamics effect in binary neutron star mergers by reviewing all the related works.</description>

      <title>Parameter study for hot spot trajectories around Sgr$A*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense flaring events in the near-infrared and X-ray wavebands of our Galactic Center have been the subject of research for decades. In recent years, the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope captured the motion and polarimetric signature of such a flare in close proximity to the supermassive black hole. This study aims to investigate a broad parameter space for hot spot motion in the vicinity of Sgr$A*$ and reproduce the observed flaring behavior. To this end, we have developed a General Relativistic Radiative Transfer code and conducted a parameter study including both planar and ejected hot spot configurations around supermassive black holes. Super-Keplerian orbital frequencies are favored by circular equatorial, cylindrical and parabolic models, whereas conical hot spot trajectories provide a better fit for orbital frequencies below the Keplerian value. Additionally, a distant observer cannot effectively differentiate between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, as well as face-on orbits at different observation angles.</description>

      <title>The flaring activity of blazar AO 0235+164 during year 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The blazar AO 0235+164, located at redshift $z=0.94$, has displayed interesting and repeating flaring activity in the past, the latest episodes occurring in 2008 and 2015. In 2020, the source brightened again, starting a new flaring episode that peaked in 2021. Aims. We study the origin and properties of the 2021 flare in relation to previous studies and the historical behavior of the source, in particular to the 2008 and 2015 flaring episodes. Methods. We analyze the multi-wavelength photo-polarimetric evolution of the source. From Very Long Baseline Array images, we derive the kinematic parameters of new components associated with the 2021 flare. We use this information to constrain a model for the spectral energy distribution of the emission during the flaring period. We propose an analytical geometric model to test whether the observed wobbling of the jet is consistent with precession. Results. We report the appearance of two new components that are ejected in a different direction than previously, confirming the wobbling of the jet. We find that the direction of ejection is consistent with that of a precessing jet.The derived period independently agrees with the values commonly found in the literature. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution further confirm that the differences between flares can be attributed to geometrical effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAGIC is a system of two 17-m diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, located at an altitude of 2200 m in Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma, exploring the gamma-ray sky above a few tens of GeV and up to tens of TeV. This system provides a low energy threshold and a fast automated response to transient phenomena. In this contribution, some selected results of MAGIC, which has been collecting data for more than 20 years, are reviewed. Special attention is given to multiwavelength and multimessenger astronomy, such as GRB 201216C, the farthest ground-based detection of a very-high-energy gamma-ray bursts, as well as the RS Ophiuchi nova. The scientific program also includes measuring the cosmic-ray electron positron spectrum, estimating the size of stars using intensity interferometry, studying gravitational lensing and searching for dark matter in spheroidal galaxies. Finally, a glimpse into the future is given by presenting the performance of the joint observations with the first Large-Sized Telescope from the Cherenkov Telescope Array and MAGIC.</description>

      <title>The dynamics and electromagnetic signatures of accretion in unequal mass binary black hole inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the gravitational wave (GW) driven inspirals of accreting black hole binaries with mass $M = 10^7 M_\odot$ and mass ratios between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$. Our results are based on analytic estimates, and grid-based hydrodynamics simulations run for many thousands of binary orbits before the merger. We show that the GW inspiral is evident in the light curves and color evolution of a binary-hosting quasar, over years to decades before a merger. The long-term electromagnetic (EM) signature is characterized by a gradual UV brightening, and X-ray dimming, followed by an X-ray disappearance hours to days before the GW burst, and finally a years-like re-brightening as the disk relaxes and refuels the remnant black hole. These timescales are surprisingly insensitive to the amplitude of viscous stress in the disk. The spectrum of quasi-thermal disk emission shows two peaks: one in the UV, and another in the X-ray, associated with the outer and circum-secondary disks respectively; emission from the inner disk is suppressed because the secondary consumes most of the inflowing gas. We discuss implications for real-time and archival EM followup of GW bursts detected by LISA.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>

      <title>Constraining $f({\cal R})$ gravity by Pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021} observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss spherically symmetric dynamical systems in the framework of a general model of $f({\cal R})$ gravity, i.e. $f({\cal R})={\cal R}e^{\zeta {\cal R}}$, where $\zeta$ is a dimensional quantity in squared length units [L$^2$]. We initially assume that the internal structure of such systems is governed by the Krori-Barua ansatz, alongside the presence of fluid anisotropy. By employing astrophysical observations obtained from the pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, derived from bursting X-ray binaries located within globular clusters, we determine that $\zeta$ is approximately equal to $\pm 5$ km$^2$. In particular, the model can create a stable configuration for {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, encompassing its geometric and physical characteristics. In $f({\cal R})$ gravity, the Krori-Barua approach links $p_r$ and $p_t$, which represent the components of the pressures, to ($\rho$), representing the density, semi-analytically. These relations are described as $p_r\approx v_r^2 (\rho-\rho_{I})$ and $p_t\approx v_t^2 (\rho-\rho_{II})$. Here, the expression $v_r$ and $v_t$ represent the radial and tangential sound speeds, respectively. Meanwhile, $\rho_I$ pertains to the surface density and $\rho_{II}$ is derived using the parameters of the model. Notably, within the frame of $f({\cal R})$ gravity where $\zeta$ is negative, the maximum compactness, denoted as $C$, is inherently limited to values that do not exceed the Buchdahl limit. This contrasts with general relativity or with $f({\cal R})$ with positive $\zeta$, where $C$ has the potential to reach the limit of the black hole asymptotically. The predictions of such model suggest a central energy density which largely exceeds the saturation of nuclear density, which has the value $\rho_{\text{nuc}} = 3\times 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$. Also, the density at the surface $\rho_I$ surpasses $\rho_{\text{nuc}}$.</description>

      <title>Black bounces in conformal Killing gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse black bounce solutions in the recently proposed ``Conformal Killing gravity'' (CKG), by coupling the theory to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. The original motivation of the theory was essentially to fulfil specific criteria that are absent in existing gravitational theories, namely, to obtain the cosmological constant as an integration constant, derive the energy-momentum conservation law as a consequence of the gravitational field equations, rather than assuming it, and not necessarily considering conformally flat metrics as vacuum solutions. In this work, we extend the static and spherically symmetric solutions obtained in the literature, and explore the possibility of black bounces in CKG, coupled to NLED and scalar fields. We find novel NLED Lagrangian densities and scalar potentials, and extend the class of black bounce solutions found in the literature. Furthermore, within black bounce geometries, we find generalizations of the Bardeen-type and Simpson-Visser geometries and explore the regularity conditions of the solutions.</description>

      <title>X-ray Cool Core Remnants Heated by Strong Radio AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong AGN heating provides an alternative means for the disruption of cluster cool cores (CCs) to cluster mergers. In this work we present a systematic Chandra study of a sample of 108 nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) galaxy clusters, to investigate the effect of AGN heating on CCs. About 40% of clusters with small offsets between the BCG and the X-ray centre ($\le50$ kpc) have small CCs. For comparison, 14 of 17 clusters with large offsets have small CCs, which suggests that mergers or sloshing can be efficient in reducing the CC size. Relaxed, small CC clusters generally have weak radio AGNs ($P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and they show a lack of systems hosting a radio AGN with intermediate radio power ($2\times10^{23}&lt;P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;2\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). We found that the strongest circumnuclear ($&lt;1$ kpc) X-ray emission only exists in clusters with strong radio AGN. The duty cycle of relaxed, small CC clusters is less than half of that for large CC clusters. It suggests that the radio activity of BCGs is affected by the properties of the surrounding gas beyond the central $\sim10$ kpc, and strong radio AGNs in small X-ray CCs fade more rapidly than those embedded in large X-ray CCs. A scenario is also presented for the transition of large CCs and coronae due to radio AGN feedback. We also present a detailed analysis of galaxy cluster 3C 129.1 as an example of a CC remnant possibly disrupted by radio AGN.</description>

      <title>A Sample of Compact Object Candidates in Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar spectra from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST DR10 catalog includes &gt; 980, 000 targets with multiple medium resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial velocity variation, and obtained an input-sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input-sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 $M_{\odot}$, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.</description>

      <title>Probing the role of self-gravity in clouds impacted by AGN-driven winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of winds and jet-inflated bubbles driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to significantly affect the host galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and regulate star formation. To explore this scenario, we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to model the interaction between turbulent star-forming clouds and highly pressurised AGN-driven outflows, focusing on the effects of self-gravity. Our results demonstrate that the cloudlets fragmented by the wind can become gravitationally bound, significantly increasing their survival time. While external pressurisation leads to a global collapse of the clouds in cases of weaker winds ($10^{42}-10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$), higher-power winds ($10^{44}-10^{45}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) disperse the gas and cause localised collapse of the cloudlets. We also demonstrate that a kinetic energy-dominated wind is more efficient in accelerating and dispersing the gas than a thermal wind with the same power. The interaction can give rise to multi-phase outflows with velocities ranging from a few 100 to several 1000~${\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The mass outflow rates are tightly correlated with the wind power, which we explain by an ablation-based mass-loss model. Moreover, the velocity dispersion and the virial parameter of the cloud material can increase by up to one order of magnitude through the effect of the wind. Even though the wind can suppress or quench star formation for about 1 Myr during the initial interaction, a substantial number of gravitationally bound dense cloudlets manage to shield themselves from the wind's influence and subsequently undergo rapid gravitational collapse, leading to an enhanced star formation rate (SFR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from spacetimes of vacuum General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using solutions of vacuum General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>Topology of Pulsar Profiles (ToPP). I. Graph theory method and classification of the EPN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the most important information on a radio pulsar is derived from its average pulse profile. Many early pulsar studies were necessarily based on only few such profiles. There, discrete profile components were linked to emission mechanism models for individual stars through human interpretation. For the population as a whole, profiles morphology must reflect the geometry and overall evolution of the radio emitting regions. The problem, however, is that this population is becoming too large for intensive studies of all sources individually. Moreover, connecting profiles from a large collection of pulsars rapidly becomes cumbersome. In this article, we present ToPP, the first-ever unsupervised method to sort pulsars by profile-shape similarity, using graph topology. We apply ToPP to the publicly available European Pulsar Network profile database, providing the first organised visual overview of multi-frequency profiles representing 90 individual pulsars. We find discrete evolutionary tracks, varying from simple, single component profiles at all frequencies, towards diverse mixtures of more complex profiles with frequency evolution. The profile evolution is continuous, extending out to millisecond pulsars, and does not fall in sharp classes. We interpret the profiles as a mixture of pulsar core/cone emission type, spin-down energetics, and the line-of-sight impact angle towards the magnetic axis. We show how ToPP can systematically classify sources into the Rankin empirical profile scheme. ToPP forms one of the key unsupervised methods that will be essential to explore upcoming pulsar census data such as expected by the Square Kilometer Array.</description>

      <title>Efficient prescription to search for linear gravitational wave memory from hyperbolic black hole encounters and its application to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose $95\%$ upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Searching for Magnetar Binaries Disrupted by Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\sim45\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\lesssim f_u \lesssim 24\%$, which disagrees with neutron star population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\lesssim f_{nc} \lesssim 66\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\lesssim f_m \lesssim 86\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from late-time jets of gamma-ray bursts seeded with cocoon photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), $\sim$ 100 - 1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (XFs; in long GRBs) or extended emission (EEs; in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius ($r_{\rm diss}$), Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$), and cosmic-ray loading factor ($\xi_p$), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multi-messenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$, assuming $\xi_p=10$. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of $\sim 1000-2000$ events, for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of non-detection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Regions of suppressed diffusion around supernova remnants?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: 1) is the suppressed diffusion {\bf to be} attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? 2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disc of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of reduced diffusion coefficient, since most remnants are located in the disc and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from these regions as well? {\bf Here we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of state (EoSs) governing neutron star (NS) matter obtained for both non-relativistic and relativistic mean-field models are systematically confronted with a diverse set of terrestrial data and astrophysical observations within the Bayesian framework. The terrestrial data, spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions, constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass. Three distinct posterior distributions of EoSs are generated by gradually updating the priors with different constraints: (i) only the maximum NS mass, (ii) incorporating additional terrestrial data, (iii) combining both the terrestrial data and astrophysical observations. These EoS distributions are then compared using the Kullback-Liebler divergence which highlights the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of NS maximum mass and terrestrial data. The remaining astrophysical observations marginally refine the EoS within the density range $\sim$ 2-3$\rho_0$. It is observed that the relativistic mean field model yields stiffer EoS around the saturation density, but predict smaller values of the speed of sound and proton fraction in the interior of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Domain Wall Networks: Impact on Pulsar Timing Arrays and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unstable domain wall (DW) networks in the early universe are cosmologically viable and can emit a large amount of gravitational waves (GW) before annihilating. As such, they provide an interpretation for the recent signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. A related important question is whether such a scenario also leads to significant production of Primordial Black Holes (PBH). We investigate both GW and PBH production using 3D numerical simulations in an expanding background, with box sizes up to $N=3240$, including the annihilation phase. We find that: i) the network decays exponentially, i.e. the false vacuum volume drops as $\sim \exp(-\eta^3)$, with $\eta$ the conformal time; ii) the GW spectrum is larger than traditional estimates by more than one order of magnitude, due to a delay between DW annihilation and the sourcing of GWs. We then present a novel semi-analytical method to estimate the PBH abundances: rare false vacuum pockets of super-Hubble size collapse to PBHs if their energy density becomes comparable to the background when they cross the Hubble scale. Smaller (but more abundant) pockets will instead collapse only if they are close to spherical. This introduces very large uncertainties in the final PBH abundance. The first phenomenological implication is that the DW interpretation of the PTA signal is compatible with observational constraints on PBHs, within the uncertainties. Second, in a different parameter region, the dark matter can be entirely in the form of asteroid-mass PBHs from the DW collapse. Remarkably, this would also lead to a GW background in the observable range of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and future interferometers, such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>

Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called "Gaia BHs" and "Gaia NSs", respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $3$ and $21$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>
