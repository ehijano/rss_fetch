      <title>Particle control via cryopumping and its impact on the edge plasma profiles of Alcator C-Mod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the high $n_{e}$ proposed for high-field fusion reactors, it is uncertain whether ionization, as opposed to plasma transport, will be most influential in determining $n_{e}$ at the pedestal and separatrix. A database of Alcator C-Mod discharges is analyzed to evaluate the impact of source modification via cryopumping. The database contains similarly-shaped H-modes at fixed $I_{p} =$ 0.8 MA and $B_{t} =$ 5.4 T, spanning a large range in $P_\mathrm{net}$ and ionization. Measurements from an edge Thomson Scattering system are combined with those from a midplane-viewing Ly$_{\alpha}$ camera to evaluate changes to $n_{e}$ and $T_{e}$ in response to changes to ionization rates, $S_\mathrm{ion}$. $n_{e}^\mathrm{sep}$ and $T_{e}^\mathrm{ped}$ are found to be most sensitive to changes to $S_\mathrm{ion}^\mathrm{sep}$, as opposed to $n_{e}^\mathrm{ped}$ and $T_{e}^\mathrm{sep}$. Dimensionless quantities, namely $\alpha_\mathrm{MHD}$ and $\nu^{*}$, are found to regulate attainable pedestal values. Select discharges at different values of $P_\mathrm{net}$ and in different pumping configurations are analyzed further using SOLPS-ITER. It is determined that changes to plasma transport coefficients are required to self-consistently model both plasma and neutral edge dynamics. Pumping is found to modify the poloidal distribution of atomic neutral density, $n_{0}$, along the separatrix, increasing $n_{0}$ at the active X-point. Opaqueness to neutrals from high $n_{e}$ in the divertor is found to play a role in mediating neutral penetration lengths and hence, the poloidal distribution of neutrals along the separatrix. Pumped discharges thus require a larger particle diffusion coefficient than that inferred purely from 1D experimental profiles at the outer midplane.</description>

      <title>Enhanced pedestal transport driven by edge collisionality on Alcator C-Mod and its role in regulating H-mode pedestal gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental measurements of plasma and neutral profiles across the pedestal are used in conjunction with 2D edge modeling to examine pedestal stiffness in Alcator C-Mod H-mode plasmas. Experiments on Alcator C-Mod observed pedestal degradation and loss in confinement below a critical value of net power crossing the separatrix, $P_\mathrm{net} = P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit} \approx 2.3$ MW. New analysis of ionization and particle flux profiles reveal saturation of the pedestal electron density, $n_{e}^\mathrm{ped}$ despite continuous increases in ionization throughout the pedestal, inversely related to $P_\mathrm{net}$. A limit to the pedestal $\nabla n_{e}$ emerges as the particle flux, $\Gamma_{D}$ continues to grow, implying increases in the effective particle diffusivity, $D_\mathrm{eff}$. This is well-correlated with the separatrix collisionality, $\nu^{*}_\mathrm{sep}$ and a turbulence control parameter, $\alpha_{t}$, implying a possible transition in type of turbulence. The transition is well correlated with the experimentally observed value of $P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit}$. SOLPS-ITER modeling is performed for select discharges from the power scan, constrained with experimental electron and neutral densities, measured at the outer midplane. The modeling confirms general growth in $D_\mathrm{eff}$, consistent with experimental findings, and additionally suggests even larger growth in $\chi_{e}$ at the same $P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit}$.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic cycle under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable and unstable manifolds, originating from hyperbolic cycles, fundamentally characterize the behaviour of dynamical systems in chaotic regions. This letter demonstrates that their shifts under perturbation, crucial for chaos control, are computable with minimal effort using functional derivatives by considering the entire system as an argument. The shifts of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, as the intersections of these manifolds, are readily calculated by analyzing the movements of the intersection points.</description>

      <title>Charged Particle Resonance In Induction Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from First Principles, the space charge manipulation of charged particles in an induction field in free space based on an unique Magnetic field strength and its oscillation Frequency relationship is demonstrated numerically and theoretically. The Larmor precession frequency for a time varying magnetic field, instead of conventionally followed static magnetic field is derived for the first time. With the dispersion relation in Ion Resonance depending on its frequency of gyration, an AC driven electromagnet based particle resonance has been proposed circumventing the use of Superconducting Permanent Magnets. Complete resonance achieved under the proposed conditions results in a sustained, fixed-frequency particle trajectory that is independent of its speed or drift. Such oscillation is visualized in a D-Shaped Resonant assembly. The amplitude and the wavelength calculations for the trajectory are demonstrated analytically. Principally noting the objectives of Synchrotron in varying the magnetic field and its frequency to generate high energy particles, the present theory addresses the same. Its applications can be explored in Space Propulsion Systems, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and sub-harmonic heating and cooling. Using this theory one can aptly generate RF Power using device specific designed resonant antennas coupling it with with Plasma.</description>

      <title>A zero dimensional study of Ohmically heated negative triangularity tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because negative triangularity plasma scenarios remain in L-mode, they do not require external heating systems that exceed the H-mode power threshold. Operating with less heating has the potential to improve performance as heating generally degrades confinement in tokamaks. Using simple zero dimensional power balance and standard empirical scaling laws for confinement, we analyze the impact of external heating on several different reactor-relevant devices (i.e. SPARC, MANTA, ITER and DEMO). We compare the nominal externally heated scenarios against equivalent negative tringularity cases without external heating. For most of these devices, the Ohmically heated negative triangularity versions achieve better performance, particularly for devices with high magnetic field and/or high fusion gain.</description>

      <title>Power handling in a highly-radiative negative triangularity pilot plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores power handling solutions for high-field, highly-radiative negative triangularity (NT) reactors based around the MANTA concept \cite{rutherford_manta_2024}. The divertor design is kept as simple as possible, opting for a standard divertor with standard leg length. FreeGS is used to create an equilibrium for the boundary region, prioritizing a short outer leg length of only $\sim$50 cm ($\sim$40\% of the minor radius). The UEDGE code package is used for the boundary plasma solution, to track plasma temperatures and fluxes to the divertor targets. It is found that for $P_\mathrm{SOL}$ = 25 MW and $n_\mathrm{sep} = 0.96 \times 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$, conditions consistent with initial core transport modeling, little additional power mitigation is necessary. For external impurity injection of just 0.13\% Ne, the peak heat flux density at the more heavily loaded outer targets falls to 7.8 MW/m$^{2}$, while the electron temperature $T_\mathrm{e}$ remains just under 5 eV. Scans around the parameter space reveal that even at densities lower than in the primary operating scenario, $P_\mathrm{SOL}$ can be increased up to 50 MW, so long as a slightly higher fraction of extrinsic radiator is used. With less than 1\% neon (Ne) impurity content, the divertor still experiences less than 10 MW/m$^{2}$ at the outer target. Design of the plasma-facing components includes a close-fitting vacuum vessel with a tungsten inner surface as well as FLiBe-carrying cooling channels fashioned into the VV wall directly behind the divertor targets. For the seeded heat flux profile, Ansys Fluent heat transfer simulations estimate that the outer target temperature remains at just below 1550\degree C. Initial scoping of advanced divertor designs shows that for an X-divertor, detachment of the outer target becomes much simpler, and plasma fluxes to the targets drop considerably with only 0.01\% Ne content.</description>

      <title>High Yield of Alpha Particles Generated in Proton-Boron Nuclear Fusion Reactions Induced in Solid Boron Hydride B${}_{18}$H${}_{22}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of solid boron hydride molecules as a fuel for proton-boron fusion was proposed by M. Kr\r{u}s and M. Londesborough at "Interaction of Inorganic Clusters, Cages, and Containers with Light" workshop in November 2021. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for first time, that the solid boron hydride, octadecaborane - \textit{anti}-B${}_{18}$H${}_{22}$, produces a relatively high yield of alpha particles of about $10^9$ per steradian using a sub-nanosecond, low-contrast laser pulse (PALS) with a typical intensity of $10^{16}$ Wcm${}^{-2}$. In contrast to previously published proton-boron studies, the boron hydrides, due to their composition containing only atoms of boron and hydrogen, represent a natural choice for future proton-boron nuclear fusion schemes.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinetic Effects on Current Gradient-Driven Instabilities of Electron Current Layers via Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron current layers form in various natural and laboratory plasmas and are susceptible to several instabilities. Tearing, driven by current gradients, stands out as a prominent instability in these layers and is considered a potential mechanism for magnetic reconnection in collisionless regimes. Electron inertia serves as a non-ideal factor causing magnetic field lines to break and subsequently reconnect. Another mode driven by current gradients, known as the surface-preserving mode, maintains magnetic field topology. We investigated the kinetic effects on these modes in the presence of finite electron temperatures using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations (implemented with the OSIRIS codebase). Temperature stabilizes the tearing mode to a large extent, except at low temperatures, due to increased electron Larmor radius and subsequent magnetic field diffusion. Introducing uniform guide fields revealed that growth rates decrease at higher temperatures due to reduced plasma beta. Conversely, for the surface-preserving mode, growth rates increase with temperature, likely due to enhanced electron flow velocities. Mixed modes, where both tearing and surface-preserving modes coexist, exhibit asymmetric structures characteristic of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. Finally, we propose future research directions building upon our findings.</description>

      <title>Study of Breather Structures in the Framework of Gardner Equation in Electron-Positron-Ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In different nonlinear mediums, the wave trains carry energy and expose many amazing features. To describe a nonlinear phenomenon, a soliton is one that preserves its shape and amplitude even after the collision. Breather is one kind of soliton structure, which is a localized wave that periodically oscillates in amplitude. This article uses the reductive perturbation technique (RPT) to get the GE from a plasma system with four parts: cold positrons that can move, hot positrons and hot electrons that are spread out in a kappa pattern, and positive ions that can't move. Then, using the Hirota bilinear method (HBM), it is possible to obtain the multi-soliton and breather structures of GE. Breathers are fluctuating regional wave packets and significantly participate in hydrodynamics as well as optics; besides, their interaction can alter the dynamical characteristics of the wave fields. We also incorporate a detailed numerical simulation study based on a newly designed code by two of the co-authors. It is found that in our plasma system, soliton solutions, especially breather solutions, exist. Although superthermal (kappa-distributed) electrons and positrons play an important role in soliton structures, This type of analysis can also apply to the propagation of finite-amplitude waves in natural phenomena like the atmosphere, ocean, optic fibres, signal processing, etc. It should also be useful to study different electrostatic disturbances in space and laboratory plasmas, where immobile positive ions, superthermal electrons, superthermal hot positrons, and mobile cold positrons are the major plasma species.</description>

      <title>A scalable multidimensional fully implicit solver for Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optimally performant fully implicit algorithm for the Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) equations based on multigrid-preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods. HMHD is a challenging system to solve numerically because it supports stiff fast dispersive waves. The preconditioner is formulated using an operator-split approximate block factorization (Schur complement), informed by physics insight. We use a vector-potential formulation (instead of a magnetic field one) to allow a clean segregation of the problematic $\nabla \times \nabla \times$ operator in the electron Ohm's law subsystem. This segregation allows the formulation of an effective damped block-Jacobi smoother for multigrid. We demonstrate by analysis that our proposed block-Jacobi iteration is convergent and has the smoothing property. The resulting HMHD solver is verified linearly with wave propagation examples, and nonlinearly with the GEM challenge reconnection problem by comparison against another HMHD code. We demonstrate the excellent algorithmic and parallel performance of the algorithm up to 16384 MPI tasks in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Competition of magnetic reconnections in self-generated and external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the competition of magnetic reconnections in self-generated and external magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas. The temporal evolution of plasma structures measured with self-emission imaging shows the vertical expansions and horizontal separation of plasma, which can be signatures of reconnection outflows in self-generated and external magnetic fields, respectively. Because the outflows in self-generated magnetic fields are not clear in the presence of the external magnetic field, the external magnetic field can suppress the magnetic reconnection in self-generated magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory, originally developed for orbits and periodic orbits in dynamical systems, \textit{e.g.} a map $\mathcal{P}$, to derive formulae for the deformation of an $d$-dimensional invariant torus, on which one can define $\mathcal{P}^k$ for $k\in \mathbb{R}$ and even $\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to continuize and generalize the exponential function $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{k}}$ in $k$. The invariant tori, which manifest as closed flux surfaces in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) machines, are the dominant structure influencing the radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of scale-dependent kurtosis with HelioSwarm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence involves complex, nonlinear interactions of electromagnetic fields and charged particles across multiple scales. Studying these phenomena in space plasmas, like the solar wind, is facilitated by the intrinsic scale separations and the availability of in situ spacecraft observations. However, the single-point or single-scale configurations of current spacecraft limit our understanding of many properties of the turbulent solar wind. To overcome these limitations, multipoint measurements spanning a range of characteristic scales are essential. This paper prepares for the enhanced measurement capabilities of upcoming multispacecraft missions by demonstrating that higher-order statistics, specifically kurtosis, as a baseline for intermittency can be accurately measured. Using synthetic turbulent fields with adjustable intermittency levels, we achieve scale separations analogous to those in the solar wind and apply these techniques to the planned trajectories of the HelioSwarm mission. This approach promises significant advancements in our understanding of plasma turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Active feedback control in magnetic confinement fusion devices is desirable to mitigate plasma instabilities and enable robust operation. Optical high-speed cameras provide a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic and can be suitable for these applications. In this study, we process fast camera data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit{in situ}$ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based methods. By implementing this model directly within the standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) experiment demonstrates an FPGA-based high-speed camera data acquisition and processing system, enabling application in real-time machine-learning-based tokamak diagnostic and control as well as potential applications in other scientific domains.</description>

Abstract: A novel form of the current potential, a mathematical tool for the design of stellarators and stellarator coils, is developed. Specifically, these are current potentials with a finite-element-like basis, called \textit{current potential patches}. Current potential patches leverage the relationship between distributions of magnetic dipoles and current potentials to explore limits of the access properties of stellarator coil sets. An example calculation is shown using the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) equilibrium, demonstrating the method's use in coil design and understanding the limits of the access properties of coil sets. Current potential patches have additional desirable properties such as of promoting sparse current sheet solutions and identifying crucial locations of shaping current placement. A result is found for the HSX equilibrium that shaping currents covering only 25\% of the winding surface is sufficient to produce the equilibrium to a good accuracy, provided a toroidal field is pre-supplied.</description>
