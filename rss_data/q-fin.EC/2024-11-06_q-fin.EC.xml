      <title>Assessing the regulatory framework of financial institutions in Canada in the context of international climate risk management practices and Canadian net zero emission targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The document addresses the essential role of financial regulatory frameworks in mitigating climate-related risks within the financial sector. The assessment evaluates Canada's efforts to establish a regulatory framework for financial climate risk disclosure, compares it to international standards, and identifies areas for improvement. The regulatory framework, fiscal impact, and incentives to relinquish investments in fossil fuel projects and transition to renewable energies swiftly and seamlessly are the primary challenges that Canada faces in achieving energy net zero targets.</description>

      <title>It Takes Three to Ceilidh: Pension System and Multidimensional Poverty Mitigation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research employs the Alkire-Foster approach to measure multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, followed by examining the role of the three-pillar pension system in mitigating household multidimensional poverty. With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the knowledge of how household participation in pension pillars sustainably mitigates multidimensional poverty through micro-level mechanisms and to the policy praxis of why a facilitating state is called for poverty mitigation from the perspective of new structural economics.</description>

      <title>Global Value Chain Linkages and Carbon Emissions embodied in trade, An Evidence from Emerging Economies: Uncovering Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores whether the Global Value Chain(GVC) participation of 16 emerging market economies (EMEs) from 1995 to 2018 in the manufacturing sector leads to a rise in carbon emissions embodied in trade. The study covers the ecological dimension of the Global Value Chain and validates the Pollution Haven Hypothesis in developing nations.To address the problem of cross-sectional dependence, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity panels, we estimate the above models using the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method. Our findings exhibit a continuous growth in carbon emissions of all the EMEs, there exists a positive association between GVC participation and domestic CO2 emissions embodied in gross exports. Also, EMEs' foreign carbon emissions embodied in gross exports directly correlate with backward GVC Participation, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Security Operations Center Productivity: Evidence from Live Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the association between generative AI (GAI) tool adoption and security operations center productivity. We find that GAI adoption is associated with a 30.13% reduction in security incident mean time to resolution. This result is robust to several modeling decisions. While unobserved confounders inhibit causal identification, this result is among the first to use observational data from live operations to investigate the relationship between GAI adoption and security worker productivity.</description>

      <title>Gender Differences in Comparative Advantage Matches: Evidence from Linked Employer-Employee Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel decomposition method based on Gaussian mixtures and k-Means clustering, applied to a large Brazilian administrative dataset, to analyze the gender wage gap through the lens of worker-firm interactions shaped by comparative advantage. These interactions generate wage levels in logs that exceed the simple sum of worker and firm components, making them challenging for traditional linear models to capture effectively. I find that these ``complementarity effects'' account for approximately 17% of the gender wage gap. Larger firms, high human capital, STEM degrees, and managerial roles are closely related to it. For instance, among managerial occupations, the match effect goes as high as one-third of the total gap. I also find women are less likely to be employed by firms offering higher returns to both human capital and firm-specific premiums, resulting in a significantly larger firm contribution to the gender wage gap than previously estimated. Combined, these factors explain nearly half of the overall gender wage gap, suggesting the importance of understanding firm-worker matches in addressing gender-based pay disparities.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Medicare Quality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, expanding Medicaid and improving access to care for millions of low-income Americans. Fewer uninsured individuals reduced the cost of uncompensated care, consequently improving the financial health of hospitals. We hypothesize that this amelioration in hospital finances resulted in a marked improvement of quality measures in states that chose to expand Medicaid. To our knowledge, the impact of Medicaid expansion on the Medicare population has not been investigated. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, we compare readmission rates for four measures from the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program: acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, heart failure, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Our analysis provides evidence that between 2013 and 2021 expansion states improved hospital quality relative to non-expansion states as it relates to acute myocardial infarction readmissions (p = 0.015) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery readmissions (p = 0.039). Our analysis provides some evidence that expanding Medicaid improved hospital quality, as measured by a reduction in readmission rates. Using visualizations, we provide some evidence that hospital quality improved for the other two measures as well. We believe that a refinement of our estimation method and an improved dataset will increase our chances of finding significant results for these two other measures.</description>

      <title>Democratic Policy Decisions with Decentralized Promises Contingent on Vote Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pre-vote interactions in a committee that enacts a welfare-improving reform through voting in the presence of heterogeneous utilities. Committee members use decentralized irrevocable promises of non-negative transfers contingent on the vote outcome to influence the voting behaviour of other committee members. Equilibrium transfers require that no coalition can deviate in a self-enforcing manner that benefits all its members ({\it Strong Nash}) and minimize total transfers. We show that equilibria exist, are indeterminate, efficient, and involve transfers from high- to low-utility members. Equilibrium transfers prevent reform opponents from persuading less enthusiastic reform supporters to vote against the reform. Transfer recipients can be reform supporters.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Feature Selection Methods for Macro-Economic Forecasting, Applied for Inflation Indicator of Iran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores various feature selection techniques applied to macro-economic forecasting, using Iran's World Bank Development Indicators. Employing a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) within a 10-fold cross-validation setup, this research systematically analyzes and ranks different feature selection methodologies. The study distinctly highlights the efficiency of Stepwise Selection, Tree-based methods, Hausdorff distance, Euclidean distance, and Mutual Information (MI) Score, noting their superior performance in reducing predictive errors. In contrast, methods like Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and Variance Thresholding showed relatively lower effectiveness. The results underline the robustness of similarity-based approaches, particularly Hausdorff and Euclidean distances, which consistently performed well across various datasets, achieving an average rank of 9.125 out of a range of tested methods. This paper provides crucial insights into the effectiveness of different feature selection methods, offering significant implications for enhancing the predictive accuracy of models used in economic analysis and planning. The findings advocate for the prioritization of stepwise and tree-based methods alongside similarity-based techniques for researchers and practitioners working with complex economic datasets.</description>
