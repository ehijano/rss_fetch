      <title>DeeperHistReg: Robust Whole Slide Images Registration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeeperHistReg is a software framework dedicated to registering whole slide images (WSIs) acquired using multiple stains. It allows one to perform the preprocessing, initial alignment, and nonrigid registration of WSIs acquired using multiple stains (e.g. hematoxylin \&amp; eosin, immunochemistry). The framework implements several state-of-the-art registration algorithms and provides an interface to operate on arbitrary resolution of the WSIs (up to 200k x 200k). The framework is extensible and new algorithms can be easily integrated by other researchers. The framework is available both as a PyPI package and as a Docker container.</description>

      <title>SwinFuSR: an image fusion-inspired model for RGB-guided thermal image super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal imaging plays a crucial role in various applications, but the inherent low resolution of commonly available infrared (IR) cameras limits its effectiveness. Conventional super-resolution (SR) methods often struggle with thermal images due to their lack of high-frequency details. Guided SR leverages information from a high-resolution image, typically in the visible spectrum, to enhance the reconstruction of a high-res IR image from the low-res input. Inspired by SwinFusion, we propose SwinFuSR, a guided SR architecture based on Swin transformers. In real world scenarios, however, the guiding modality (e.g. RBG image) may be missing, so we propose a training method that improves the robustness of the model in this case. Our method has few parameters and outperforms state of the art models in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural SIMilarity (SSIM). In Track 2 of the PBVS 2024 Thermal Image Super-Resolution Challenge, it achieves 3rd place in the PSNR metric. Our code and pretained weights are available at https://github.com/VisionICLab/SwinFuSR.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound SAM Adapter: Adapting SAM for Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently achieved amazing results in the field of natural image segmentation. However, it is not effective for medical image segmentation, owing to the large domain gap between natural and medical images. In this paper, we mainly focus on ultrasound image segmentation. As we know that it is very difficult to train a foundation model for ultrasound image data due to the lack of large-scale annotated ultrasound image data. To address these issues, in this paper, we develop a novel Breast Ultrasound SAM Adapter, termed Breast Ultrasound Segment Anything Model (BUSSAM), which migrates the SAM to the field of breast ultrasound image segmentation by using the adapter technique. To be specific, we first design a novel CNN image encoder, which is fully trained on the BUS dataset. Our CNN image encoder is more lightweight, and focuses more on features of local receptive field, which provides the complementary information to the ViT branch in SAM. Then, we design a novel Cross-Branch Adapter to allow the CNN image encoder to fully interact with the ViT image encoder in SAM module. Finally, we add both of the Position Adapter and the Feature Adapter to the ViT branch to fine-tune the original SAM. The experimental results on AMUBUS and BUSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other medical image segmentation models significantly. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/bscs12/BUSSAM.</description>

      <title>FreSeg: Frenet-Frame-based Part Segmentation for 3D Curvilinear Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Part segmentation is a crucial task for 3D curvilinear structures like neuron dendrites and blood vessels, enabling the analysis of dendritic spines and aneurysms with scientific and clinical significance. However, their diversely winded morphology poses a generalization challenge to existing deep learning methods, which leads to labor-intensive manual correction. In this work, we propose FreSeg, a framework of part segmentation tasks for 3D curvilinear structures. With Frenet-Frame-based point cloud transformation, it enables the models to learn more generalizable features and have significant performance improvements on tasks involving elongated and curvy geometries. We evaluate FreSeg on 2 datasets: 1) DenSpineEM, an in-house dataset for dendritic spine segmentation, and 2) IntrA, a public 3D dataset for intracranial aneurysm segmentation. Further, we will release the DenSpineEM dataset, which includes roughly 6,000 spines from 69 dendrites from 3 public electron microscopy (EM) datasets, to foster the development of effective dendritic spine instance extraction methods and, consequently, large-scale connectivity analysis to better understand mammalian brains.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Contrail Detection: A Deep Learning Approach with EfficientNet-b4 Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of environmental sustainability, the aviation industry faces the challenge of minimizing its ecological footprint. Among the key solutions is contrail avoidance, targeting the linear ice-crystal clouds produced by aircraft exhaust. These contrails exacerbate global warming by trapping atmospheric heat, necessitating precise segmentation and comprehensive analysis of contrail images to gauge their environmental impact. However, this segmentation task is complex due to the varying appearances of contrails under different atmospheric conditions and potential misalignment issues in predictive modeling. This paper presents an innovative deep-learning approach utilizing the efficient net-b4 encoder for feature extraction, seamlessly integrating misalignment correction, soft labeling, and pseudo-labeling techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of contrail detection in satellite imagery. The proposed methodology aims to redefine contrail image analysis and contribute to the objectives of sustainable aviation by providing a robust framework for precise contrail detection and analysis in satellite imagery, thus aiding in the mitigation of aviation's environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Double Privacy Guard: Robust Traceable Adversarial Watermarking against Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide deployment of Face Recognition (FR) systems poses risks of privacy leakage. One countermeasure to address this issue is adversarial attacks, which deceive malicious FR searches but simultaneously interfere the normal identity verification of trusted authorizers. In this paper, we propose the first Double Privacy Guard (DPG) scheme based on traceable adversarial watermarking. DPG employs a one-time watermark embedding to deceive unauthorized FR models and allows authorizers to perform identity verification by extracting the watermark. Specifically, we propose an information-guided adversarial attack against FR models. The encoder embeds an identity-specific watermark into the deep feature space of the carrier, guiding recognizable features of the image to deviate from the source identity. We further adopt a collaborative meta-optimization strategy compatible with sub-tasks, which regularizes the joint optimization direction of the encoder and decoder. This strategy enhances the representation of universal carrier features, mitigating multi-objective optimization conflicts in watermarking. Experiments confirm that DPG achieves significant attack success rates and traceability accuracy on state-of-the-art FR models, exhibiting remarkable robustness that outperforms the existing privacy protection methods using adversarial attacks and deep watermarking, or simple combinations of the two. Our work potentially opens up new insights into proactive protection for FR privacy.</description>

      <title>SC-HVPPNet: Spatial and Channel Hybrid-Attention Video Post-Processing Network with CNN and Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer have attracted much attention recently for video post-processing (VPP). However, the interaction between CNN and Transformer in existing VPP methods is not fully explored, leading to inefficient communication between the local and global extracted features. In this paper, we explore the interaction between CNN and Transformer in the task of VPP, and propose a novel Spatial and Channel Hybrid-Attention Video Post-Processing Network (SC-HVPPNet), which can cooperatively exploit the image priors in both spatial and channel domains. Specifically, in the spatial domain, a novel spatial attention fusion module is designed, in which two attention weights are generated to fuse the local and global representations collaboratively. In the channel domain, a novel channel attention fusion module is developed, which can blend the deep representations at the channel dimension dynamically. Extensive experiments show that SC-HVPPNet notably boosts video restoration quality, with average bitrate savings of 5.29%, 12.42%, and 13.09% for Y, U, and V components in the VTM-11.0-NNVC RA configuration.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision-transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 230 to 707 PFLOPS, with scaling efficiency maintained at 78% to 96% across 24,576 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>Importance of Disjoint Sampling in Conventional and Transformer Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disjoint sampling is critical for rigorous and unbiased evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. When training, validation, and test sets overlap or share data, it introduces a bias that inflates performance metrics and prevents accurate assessment of a model's true ability to generalize to new examples. This paper presents an innovative disjoint sampling approach for training SOTA models on Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) tasks. By separating training, validation, and test data without overlap, the proposed method facilitates a fairer evaluation of how well a model can classify pixels it was not exposed to during training or validation. Experiments demonstrate the approach significantly improves a model's generalization compared to alternatives that include training and validation data in test data. By eliminating data leakage between sets, disjoint sampling provides reliable metrics for benchmarking progress in HSIC. Researchers can have confidence that reported performance truly reflects a model's capabilities for classifying new scenes, not just memorized pixels. This rigorous methodology is critical for advancing SOTA models and their real-world application to large-scale land mapping with Hyperspectral sensors.

      <title>Interpreting COVID Lateral Flow Tests' Results with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lateral flow tests (LFTs) enable rapid, low-cost testing for health conditions including Covid, pregnancy, HIV, and malaria. Automated readers of LFT results can yield many benefits including empowering blind people to independently learn about their health and accelerating data entry for large-scale monitoring (e.g., for pandemics such as Covid) by using only a single photograph per LFT test. Accordingly, we explore the abilities of modern foundation vision language models (VLMs) in interpreting such tests. To enable this analysis, we first create a new labeled dataset with hierarchical segmentations of each LFT test and its nested test result window. We call this dataset LFT-Grounding. Next, we benchmark eight modern VLMs in zero-shot settings for analyzing these images. We demonstrate that current VLMs frequently fail to correctly identify the type of LFT test, interpret the test results, locate the nested result window of the LFT tests, and recognize LFT tests when they partially obfuscated. To facilitate community-wide progress towards automated LFT reading, we publicly release our dataset at https://iamstuti.github.io/lft_grounding_foundation_models/.</description>

      <title>The Brain Tumor Segmentation in Pediatrics (BraTS-PEDs) Challenge: Focus on Pediatrics (CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pediatric tumors of the central nervous system are the most common cause of cancer-related death in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade gliomas in children is less than 20%. Due to their rarity, the diagnosis of these entities is often delayed, their treatment is mainly based on historic treatment concepts, and clinical trials require multi-institutional collaborations. Here we present the CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge, focused on pediatric brain tumors with data acquired across multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. The CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge brings together clinicians and AI/imaging scientists to lead to faster development of automated segmentation techniques that could benefit clinical trials, and ultimately the care of children with brain tumors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mixed-Scale Feature Fusion Network for Blind AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing maturity of the text-to-image and image-to-image generative models, AI-generated images (AGIs) have shown great application potential in advertisement, entertainment, education, social media, etc. Although remarkable advancements have been achieved in generative models, very few efforts have been paid to design relevant quality assessment models. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image quality assessment (IQA) network, named AMFF-Net, for AGIs. AMFF-Net evaluates AGI quality from three dimensions, i.e., "visual quality", "authenticity", and "consistency". Specifically, inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system and motivated by the observation that "visual quality" and "authenticity" are characterized by both local and global aspects, AMFF-Net scales the image up and down and takes the scaled images and original-sized image as the inputs to obtain multi-scale features. After that, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) block is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features with learnable weights. In addition, considering the correlation between the image and prompt, AMFF-Net compares the semantic features from text encoder and image encoder to evaluate the text-to-image alignment. We carry out extensive experiments on three AGI quality assessment databases, and the experimental results show that our AMFF-Net obtains better performance than nine state-of-the-art blind IQA methods. The results of ablation experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scale input strategy and AFF block.</description>

      <title>Real-time Lane-wise Traffic Monitoring in Optimal ROIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the US, thousands of Pan, Tilt, and Zoom (PTZ) traffic cameras monitor highway conditions. There is a great interest in using these highway cameras to gather valuable road traffic data to support traffic analysis and decision-making for highway safety and efficient traffic management. However, there are too many cameras for a few human traffic operators to effectively monitor, so a fully automated solution is desired. This paper introduces a novel system that learns the locations of highway lanes and traffic directions from these camera feeds automatically. It collects real-time, lane-specific traffic data continuously, even adjusting for changes in camera angle or zoom. This facilitates efficient traffic analysis, decision-making, and improved highway safety.</description>

      <title>Metric-guided Image Reconstruction Bounds via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have led to novel imaging systems and algorithms that address ill-posed problems. Assessing their trustworthiness and understanding how to deploy them safely at test time remains an important and open problem. We propose a method that leverages conformal prediction to retrieve upper/lower bounds and statistical inliers/outliers of reconstructions based on the prediction intervals of downstream metrics. We apply our method to sparse-view CT for downstream radiotherapy planning and show 1) that metric-guided bounds have valid coverage for downstream metrics while conventional pixel-wise bounds do not and 2) anatomical differences of upper/lower bounds between metric-guided and pixel-wise methods. Our work paves the way for more meaningful reconstruction bounds. Code available at https://github.com/matthewyccheung/conformal-metric</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory of super-resolution and two-point resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the fundamental aspects of super-resolution, particularly addressing the stability of super-resolution and the estimation of two-point resolution. Our first major contribution is the introduction of two location-amplitude identities that characterize the relationships between locations and amplitudes of true and recovered sources in the one-dimensional super-resolution problem. These identities facilitate direct derivations of the super-resolution capabilities for recovering the number, location, and amplitude of sources, significantly advancing existing estimations to levels of practical relevance. As a natural extension, we establish the stability of a specific $l_0$ minimization algorithm in the super-resolution problem.
  The second crucial contribution of this paper is the theoretical proof of a two-point resolution limit in multi-dimensional spaces. The resolution limit is expressed as:
  \[
  R = \frac{4\arcsin \left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \right)}{\Omega}
  \]
  for $\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}\leq\frac{1}{2}$, where $\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}$ represents the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}$) and $\Omega$ is the cutoff frequency. It also demonstrates that for resolving two point sources, the resolution can exceed the Rayleigh limit $\frac{\pi}{\Omega}$ when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds $2$. Moreover, we find a tractable algorithm that achieves the resolution $R$ when distinguishing two sources.</description>

      <title>Feature Imitating Networks Enhance The Performance, Reliability And Speed Of Deep Learning On Biomedical Image Processing Tasks</title>

Abstract: Feature-Imitating-Networks (FINs) are neural networks that are first trained to approximate closed-form statistical features (e.g. Entropy), and then embedded into other networks to enhance their performance. In this work, we perform the first evaluation of FINs for biomedical image processing tasks. We begin by training a set of FINs to imitate six common radiomics features, and then compare the performance of larger networks (with and without embedding the FINs) for three experimental tasks: COVID-19 detection from CT scans, brain tumor classification from MRI scans, and brain-tumor segmentation from MRI scans. We found that models embedded with FINs provided enhanced performance for all three tasks when compared to baseline networks without FINs, even when those baseline networks had more parameters. Additionally, we found that models embedded with FINs converged faster and more consistently compared to baseline networks with similar or greater representational capacity. The results of our experiments provide evidence that FINs may offer state-of-the-art performance for a variety of other biomedical image processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparsity aware coding for single photon sensitive vision using Selective Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical coding is widely used in computational imaging systems and is a good approach for designing vision systems. However, most coding methods are developed assuming additive Gaussian noise, while modern optical imaging systems are mainly affected by Poisson noise. Previous studies have highlighted the significant differences between these noise models and proposed coding optimization algorithms for image recovery under Poisson noise. They concluded that the compressibility arising from data variance is crucial for image recovery under Poisson noise. This makes a strong case for the design of end-to-end vision systems that avoid image formation, since the data-driven vision tasks, typically downstream of imaging, is more compressible than imaging itself. In this project, we propose a coding strategy by jointly optimizing an entire vision system, including measurement and inference, using the classification accuracy as a metric. We demonstrate the importance of incorporating Poisson noise in optimizing even the simplest vision systems and propose an approach to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Improved Cryo-EM Pose Estimation and 3D Classification through Latent-Space Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses (projection angles and image shifts) in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D images is very challenging. In addition to these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction requires conformational classification. In popular cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms, poses and conformation classification labels must be predicted for every input cryo-EM image, which can be computationally costly for large datasets. An emerging class of methods adopted the amortized inference approach. In these methods, only a subset of the input dataset is needed to train neural networks for the estimation of poses and conformations. Once trained, these neural networks can make pose/conformation predictions and 3D reconstructions at low cost for the entire dataset during inference. Unfortunately, when facing heterogeneous reconstruction tasks, it is hard for current amortized-inference-based methods to effectively estimate the conformational distribution and poses from entangled latent variables. Here, we propose a self-supervised variational autoencoder architecture called "HetACUMN" based on amortized inference. We employed an auxiliary conditional pose prediction task by inverting the order of encoder-decoder to explicitly enforce the disentanglement of conformation and pose predictions. Results on simulated datasets show that HetACUMN generated more accurate conformational classifications than other amortized or non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we show that HetACUMN is capable of performing heterogeneous 3D reconstructions of a real experimental dataset.</description>

      <title>Attention-Map Augmentation for Hypercomplex Breast Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer is the most widespread neoplasm among women and early detection of this disease is critical. Deep learning techniques have become of great interest to improve diagnostic performance. However, distinguishing between malignant and benign masses in whole mammograms poses a challenge, as they appear nearly identical to an untrained eye, and the region of interest (ROI) constitutes only a small fraction of the entire image. In this paper, we propose a framework, parameterized hypercomplex attention maps (PHAM), to overcome these problems. Specifically, we deploy an augmentation step based on computing attention maps. Then, the attention maps are used to condition the classification step by constructing a multi-dimensional input comprised of the original breast cancer image and the corresponding attention map. In this step, a parameterized hypercomplex neural network (PHNN) is employed to perform breast cancer classification. The framework offers two main advantages. First, attention maps provide critical information regarding the ROI and allow the neural model to concentrate on it. Second, the hypercomplex architecture has the ability to model local relations between input dimensions thanks to hypercomplex algebra rules, thus properly exploiting the information provided by the attention map. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework on both mammography images as well as histopathological ones. We surpass attention-based state-of-the-art networks and the real-valued counterpart of our approach. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/ispamm/AttentionBCS.</description>

      <title>PuzzleTuning: Explicitly Bridge Pathological and Natural Image with Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathological image analysis is a crucial field in computer vision. Due to the annotation scarcity in the pathological field, pre-training with self-supervised learning (SSL) is widely applied to learn on unlabeled images. However, the current SSL-based pathological pre-training: (1) does not explicitly explore the essential focuses of the pathological field, and (2) does not effectively bridge with and thus take advantage of the knowledge from natural images. To explicitly address them, we propose our large-scale PuzzleTuning framework, containing the following innovations. Firstly, we define three task focuses that can effectively bridge knowledge of pathological and natural domain: appearance consistency, spatial consistency, and restoration understanding. Secondly, we devise a novel multiple puzzle restoring task, which explicitly pre-trains the model regarding these focuses. Thirdly, we introduce an explicit prompt-tuning process to incrementally integrate the domain-specific knowledge. It builds a bridge to align the large domain gap between natural and pathological images. Additionally, a curriculum-learning training strategy is designed to regulate task difficulty, making the model adaptive to the puzzle restoring complexity. Experimental results show that our PuzzleTuning framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks on multiple datasets. The code, demo, and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/sagizty/PuzzleTuning.</description>

      <title>Diagnosis of Multiple Fundus Disorders Amidst a Scarcity of Medical Experts Via Self-supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundus diseases are major causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, especially in underdeveloped regions, where the shortage of ophthalmologists hinders timely diagnosis. AI-assisted fundus image analysis has several advantages, such as high accuracy, reduced workload, and improved accessibility, but it requires a large amount of expert-annotated data to build reliable models. To address this dilemma, we propose a general self-supervised machine learning framework that can handle diverse fundus diseases from unlabeled fundus images. Our method's AUC surpasses existing supervised approaches by 15.7%, and even exceeds performance of a single human expert. Furthermore, our model adapts well to various datasets from different regions, races, and heterogeneous image sources or qualities from multiple cameras or devices. Our method offers a label-free general framework to diagnose fundus diseases, which could potentially benefit telehealth programs for early screening of people at risk of vision loss.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Orthogonal Transform-Based Perceptron Layers for Efficient ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a set of transform-based neural network layers as an alternative to the $3\times3$ Conv2D layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed layers can be implemented based on orthogonal transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Hadamard transform (HT), and biorthogonal Block Wavelet Transform (BWT). Furthermore, by taking advantage of the convolution theorems, convolutional filtering operations are performed in the transform domain using element-wise multiplications. Trainable soft-thresholding layers, that remove noise in the transform domain, bring nonlinearity to the transform domain layers. Compared to the Conv2D layer, which is spatial-agnostic and channel-specific, the proposed layers are location-specific and channel-specific. Moreover, these proposed layers reduce the number of parameters and multiplications significantly while improving the accuracy results of regular ResNets on the ImageNet-1K classification task. Furthermore, they can be inserted with a batch normalization layer before the global average pooling layer in the conventional ResNets as an additional layer to improve classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>CLEANing Cygnus A deep and fast with R2D2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel deep learning paradigm for synthesis imaging by radio interferometry in astronomy was recently proposed, dubbed "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging" (R2D2). In this work, we start by shedding light on R2D2's algorithmic structure, interpreting it as a learned version of CLEAN with minor cycles substituted with a deep neural network (DNN) whose training is iteration-specific. We then proceed with R2D2's first demonstration on real data, for monochromatic intensity imaging of the radio galaxy Cygnus A from S band observations with the Very Large Array (VLA). We show that the modeling power of R2D2's learning approach enables delivering high-precision imaging, superseding the resolution of CLEAN, and matching the precision of modern optimization and plug-and-play algorithms, respectively uSARA and AIRI. Requiring few major-cycle iterations only, R2D2 provides a much faster reconstruction than uSARA and AIRI, known to be highly iterative, and is at least as fast as CLEAN.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Hypercomplex Phase Retrieval: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypercomplex signal processing (HSP) provides state-of-the-art tools to handle multidimensional signals by harnessing intrinsic correlation of the signal dimensions through Clifford algebra. Recently, the hypercomplex representation of the phase retrieval (PR) problem, wherein a complex-valued signal is estimated through its intensity-only projections, has attracted significant interest. The hypercomplex PR (HPR) arises in many optical imaging and computational sensing applications that usually comprise quaternion and octonion-valued signals. Analogous to the traditional PR, measurements in HPR may involve complex, hypercomplex, Fourier, and other sensing matrices. This set of problems opens opportunities for developing novel HSP tools and algorithms. This article provides a synopsis of the emerging areas and applications of HPR with a focus on optical imaging.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Model for Realistic License Plate Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle license plate recognition is a crucial task in intelligent traffic management systems. However, the challenge of achieving accurate recognition persists due to motion blur from fast-moving vehicles. Despite the widespread use of image synthesis approaches in existing deblurring and recognition algorithms, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains unproven. To address this, we introduce the first large-scale license plate deblurring dataset named License Plate Blur (LPBlur), captured by a dual-camera system and processed through a post-processing pipeline to avoid misalignment issues. Then, we propose a License Plate Deblurring Generative Adversarial Network (LPDGAN) to tackle the license plate deblurring: 1) a Feature Fusion Module to integrate multi-scale latent codes; 2) a Text Reconstruction Module to restore structure through textual modality; 3) a Partition Discriminator Module to enhance the model's perception of details in each letter. Extensive experiments validate the reliability of the LPBlur dataset for both model training and testing, showcasing that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art motion deblurring methods in realistic license plate deblurring scenarios. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/haoyGONG/LPDGAN.</description>
