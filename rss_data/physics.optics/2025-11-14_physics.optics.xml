      <title>HAMscope: a snapshot Hyperspectral Autofluorescence Miniscope for real-time molecular imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by &gt; 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for precise and uncertainty-quantified single-shot widefield interferometric geometrical nanometrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced geometrical nanometrology is critical for process control in semiconductor manufacturing, supporting applications in, e.g., photonic integrated circuits, nanoelectronics, and emerging quantum and optoelectronic technologies. Widefield interferometric approach provide a cost-effective, non-destructive solution for characterizing semiconductor optical waveguides, which are fundamental to nanophotonic devices. This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides. This method contributes to high-precision nanometrology by integrating advanced statistical modeling and inference techniques.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent excitonic light manipulation with atomically-thin optical elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer 2D semiconductors, such as WS2, exhibit uniquely strong light-matter interactions due to exciton resonances that enable atomically-thin optical elements. Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</description>

      <title>Broadband Solar Selective Absorber with Dallenbach-type Bilayer Structure Achieved Using Carbon Nanotube Membranes with Tailored Optical Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.</description>

      <title>Surface Plasmon Mediated Giant Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov Shifts on a Corrugated Metal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced beam shifts mediated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at metal-dielectric interfaces have been widely investigated. However, research on the associated Imbert-Fedorov or spin Hall shifts, driven by the spin-orbit interaction of structured light in structured interfaces, has been comparatively scarce and limited. We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated. Our work establishes the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction of light and the weak measurement approach as an important methodology in amplifying SPR effects, which may have important connotations in applications involving light at nanoscales.</description>

      <title>The $N$-achromat and beyond: a unified variational framework for optimal chromatic aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present novel and effective methods for reducing chromatic aberrations in
  cemented lens systems. We derive an analytical solution coined the pentachromat, which
  corrects five distinct colors. This method can naturally be extended to accommodate
  an arbitrary number of lenses and to correct for a customized selection of spectral lines.
  Since correcting for specific rays rather than the entire residual spectrum
  can overconstrain the system, we introduce a variational formulation. This approach
  tames the residual spectrum by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional
  designs like the superachromat, while giving theoretical guarantees to reach the
  optimal solutions.
  Furthermore, this innovative methodology opens up previously uncharted design
  possibilities, such as multiple-focal-length achromatic systems. This allows for the
  selection of specific optical powers paired with desired bandwidths, enabling the
  design of highly specialized and tailored optical systems.
  Finally, we couple our variational framework with a combinatorial search, allowing to
  find the type of glasses and their geometry such that it reaches the best residual spectrum
  over an available catalogue.</description>

      <title>Rotational Jamming of Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</description>

      <title>M3Scope a 3D multimode multiplane microscope for imaging nanoscale dynamics in soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.</description>

      <title>Dynamic full-field swept-source optical coherence microscope for cellular-resolution, long-depth, and intratissue-activity imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope (OCM) uses a high-numerical-aperture objective to achieve cellular-level lateral resolution. However, its practical imaging depth range is limited by the depth of focus (DOF). Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line). Volumetric dynamic imaging with cellular-level lateral resolution was demonstrated over the full depth of the spheroid.</description>

      <title>Systematic dispersion engineering of crystalline microresonators for broadband and coherent frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraprecision machining offers a powerful route to dispersion control in crystalline microresonators, allowing the design of waveguide geometries for tailoring the spectrum of microresonator frequency combs. By precisely designing the geometry, both group-velocity and higher-order dispersions can be engineered across a broad wavelength range. However, despite their promising features, such advantages have remained largely unexplored due to fabrication challenges. Here, we demonstrate that resonators shaped by ultrapecision machining exhibit high precision and strongly suppressed spatial mode interactions, facilitating the generation of smooth dissipative Kerr soliton combs and broadband frequency combs beyond the telecommunication C-band. These results underscore the effectiveness of precision geometry control for realizing coherent and broadband microcombs on crystalline photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Free-Electron Nonclassical Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electric-Magnetic Geometric Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric phases play an enormous role in optics and are generally associated with the evolution of light's polarization state on the Poincar\'{e} sphere, or its spin on the sphere of spin directions. Here we put forward a new kind of optical geometric phase that appears exclusively in nonparaxial light, resulting from cyclic changes to the relative amplitude and phase between the electric and magnetic fields. This phase is naturally represented on a recently introduced `electric-magnetic' sphere.</description>

      <title>Phase noise properties of supercontinuum generation in all-normal dispersion fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral coherence properties of supercontinuum generation in polarization-maintaining all-normal dispersion fibers are investigated. Stochastic phase noise induced by energy fluctuations, along with spectrally-resolved intensity-to-phase transfer coefficients, are quantitatively analyzed, confirming the high coherence of the generated supercontinuum. Our results show that the nonlinear process is fundamentally deterministic with ultra-low spectral phase noise, yet exhibits significant intensity-to-phase coupling.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale conformal metasurface optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved and conformal optics offer significant advantages by unlocking additional geometric degrees of freedom for optical design. These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Spacetime Crystals Induced by Anomalous Velocity Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-modulated media offer powerful opportunities for controlling light, yet extending such concepts to optical frequencies has remained challenging. Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons. These findings identify Weyl semimetals as a promising platform for realizing optical spacetime crystals and open a pathway toward active and nonreciprocal photonic systems governed by quantum geometric effects.</description>

      <title>Broadband ultrafast self-heterodyned chiro-optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (&lt;50 ${\mu}$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interpolation of Entanglement Purification Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.</description>

      <title>Learning phase diversity for solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems in imaging are typically ill-posed and are usually solved by employing regularized optimization techniques. The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism. Our results may open new avenues for leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems across a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency Spectra of Isolated Laser Pulse Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.</description>

      <title>Tabletop Lensless Imaging in the Extreme Ultraviolet with Reduced Radiation Dose</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution extreme ultraviolet (XUV) imaging remains limited by conventional approaches that require complex optics such as multilayer mirrors and zone plates. These methods are expensive, suffer from chromatic aberrations and narrow fields of view, and demand highly stable, coherent beam sources typically found only at large-scale facilities. Critically, the high photon flux they require often damages sensitive biological and soft-matter samples. We present a new solution: a lensless XUV microscopy platform combining a compact tabletop high-harmonic generation source with correlation-based ghost imaging. Our approach eliminates the need for complex optics, lowering system cost and dramatically improving resilience against lab-scale instabilities. Leveraging Hadamard patterns and compressive sensing algorithms, we achieve high-fidelity imaging even in low-photon environments, with a 400\% improvement in structural similarity index compared to baseline methods. This confirms the feasibility of broadband, low-dose XUV imaging, enabling damage-minimized, non-destructive inspection for advanced materials and biological specimens, and establishes a new paradigm for accessible XUV microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the optical lever principle to detect minute fluctuations of a liquid-air interface. Waves propagating on the interface deflect a specularly reflected laser beam, inducing angular deviations captured by a dual-element photodiode. We implement this principle in a compact set-up that includes a temperature-controlled fluid sample. This allows us to detect deflection angle fluctuations across five orders of magnitude in frequency, from individual low-frequency surface eigenmodes to the thermal distribution of high-frequency capillary waves. In addition to demonstrating the method's versatility and broad dynamical range, we highlight practical considerations in characterising liquid interface dynamics, bridging established optical methods with their application to fluid and soft-matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of plasmonic resonances across a broad spectral range is central to the development of tunable optical devices. Yet, achieving both redshifts and blueshifts within a single nanostructure has remained elusive. Here we introduce a metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) nanodisk array that enables bidirectional tuning of resonance wavelengths throughout the near-infrared (NIR) region. The observed spectral evolution follows the plasmon ruler relationship, with unprecedented tuning properties. In particular, we report a record blueshift response of 457.82 nm for a small nanodisk thickness variation of only 5-10 nm, the highest blueshift response demonstrated in plasmonic architectures to date. This platform offers finely tunable resonances spanning an exceptionally wide NIR range, providing new insights into electromagnetic (EM) coupling mechanisms and establishing a foundation for next-generation tunable devices in sensing, optical communications, and dynamic displays.</description>

      <title>Integrated soliton microcombs beyond the turnkey limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in optical microresonators are accelerating the transition of optical frequency combs from laboratory instruments to industrial platforms. Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology.</description>

Abstract: Photonic space time crystals (PSTCs) are emerging materials characterized by periodic variations in electromagnetic parameters with respect to both space and time. To date, research on PSTCs remains theoretical, with no practical realization reported. This article presents the practical realization of PSTCs through the design and simulation of a 2D metasurface-based photonic space-time crystal. It illustrates the characteristics of energy bandgaps, momentum bandgaps, and mixed energy momentum bandgap eigenmodes within the dispersion relation of these crystals. Additionally, the article details the properties of second order exceptional points that occur when two bandgaps overlap under specific conditions. The application of the metasurface based PSTC in 6G wireless communications is also demonstrated. This work aims to advance the understanding of PSTCs and their potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</description>
