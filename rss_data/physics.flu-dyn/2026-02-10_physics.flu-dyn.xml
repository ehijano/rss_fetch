      <title>Effect of velocity, fluid properties and drop shape on coalescence and neck oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric numerical simulations to investigate the coalescence dynamics of a liquid drop in a deep liquid pool. This study aims to generalize the mechanisms of partial coalescence across a range of drop shapes, elucidate the underlying mechanism of neck oscillations, and examine the roles of inertial, viscous and gravitational forces, quantified by the Weber, Ohnesorge, and Bond numbers, in governing the coalescence behavior. A phase diagram is constructed to delineate the boundaries between partial and complete coalescence regimes based on these dimensionless parameters. Our analysis of the height-to-neck ratio shows that, upon contact with the pool, the primary drop forms an upward liquid column that ultimately pinches off due to inwardly directed horizontal momentum. Additionally, the study suggests that as the dimensionless numbers increase, the effect of the vertical collapse rate plays a significant role in the outcome of the coalescence process. Notably, the Rayleigh-Plateau instability is found to be insignificant in driving partial coalescence within the explored parameter space. We identified a transition regime between partial and complete coalescence, characterized by multiple neck oscillations that delay the pinch-off of secondary droplets. The formation of secondary droplets is most prominent for prolate drops, followed by spherical and oblate drops of comparable volume. Furthermore, we observe that the tendency to form multiple droplets from elongated liquid columns diminishes with an increase in the impact velocity of the primary drop.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological energy exchange of diatomic gases: Comparison of Pullin and Borgnakke-Larsen models in direct simulation Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hypersonic rarefied flows, insufficient intermolecular collisions cause significant deviations between translational and rotational temperatures, leading to strong thermal nonequilibrium. For diatomic gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method commonly employs the Borgnakke-Larsen (BL) model to simulate translational-rotational energy exchange (relaxation) processes. Although widely used, the BL model lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation and assumes that only a fraction of collisions lead to rotational relaxation. To address these shortcomings, Pullin introduced a kinetically consistent relaxation model into the gas kinetic theory. By employing the Beta function for energy partitioning, a concrete collision cross section that satisfies the detailed balance condition is constructed. In this study, a comparative investigation of the BL and Pullin models is performed within the DSMC framework, where both original and simplified equations are considered and parameterized by physical accommodated coefficient in the Beta function. A series of test cases--including zero-dimensional rotational relaxation of nitrogen, one-dimensional planar Couette flow and normal shock wave, two-dimensional hypersonic flow past a cylinder, and three-dimensional hypersonic flow around an X38-like vehicle--are performed to assess the accuracy and efficiency of these models. The results confirm the consistency between the Pullin and BL models. Owing to its rigorous theoretical foundation and accurate physical representation, the Pullin model is expected to provide substantial support for the extension of subsequent theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Moreover, in the highly rarefied flow regime (Knudsen number greater than 1, or altitudes above 100 km), the simplified Pullin model exhibits performance comparable to that of the BL model.</description>

      <title>StabOp: A Data-Driven Stabilization Operator for Reduced Order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial filters have played a central role in large eddy simulation and, more recently, in reduced order model (ROM) stabilization for convection-dominated flows. Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000. Our numerical results show that the StabOp-L-ROM can be orders of magnitude more accurate than the classical L-ROM tuned with an optimal filter radius in the predictive regime. Furthermore, while the new StabOp smooths the input flow fields, its smoothing mechanism differs from that of classical spatial filters.</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional Two-Temperature Gas-Kinetic Scheme with Generalized Kinetic Boundary Condition for Hypersonic SBLI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of aerothermal loads in hypersonic flows is critical yet challenging due to the coupling of Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions (SBLI) and thermal non-equilibrium. This work presents the development of a three-dimensional two-temperature Gas-Kinetic Scheme (3D 2T-GKS) on unstructured meshes. The scheme resolves translational-rotational and vibrational energy modes within a unified kinetic framework. A key innovation is the integration of a Generalized Kinetic Boundary Condition (GKBC), which physically decouples the thermal accommodation of vibrational energy from the translational-rotational mode, thereby offering a more accurate model for gas-surface interactions. Additionally, a Discontinuity Feedback Factor (DFF) is employed to capture strong shock waves with reduced numerical dissipation compared to classical limiters. The method is rigorously validated against standard experimental benchmarks, including the sharp double-cone and hollow cylinder-flare configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solver, augmented by the GKBC, accurately captures complex wave structures, separation topologies, and surface heat flux distributions. These findings confirm the robustness and fidelity of the 3D 2T-GKS for simulating complex hypersonic non-equilibrium flows.</description>

      <title>A Wind Turbine Efficiency Limit Higher than the Lanchester (Betz) Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the upper limit on the fraction of power that can be extracted from an airstream approaching a wind turbine is about 78% rather than the historical value of 59%. This higher limit is based on the assumption that the wind turbine cannot accelerate the flow at its exit plane above the freestream velocity. The derivation of the historical limit of 59% must either violate the angular momentum equation or the continuity equation.</description>

      <title>A few-shot and physically restorable symbolic regression turbulence model based on normalized general effective-viscosity hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex, irregular flow phenomenon ubiquitous in natural processes and engineering applications. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method, owing to its low computational cost, has become the primary approach for rapid simulation of engineering turbulence problems. However, the inaccuracy of classical turbulence models constitutes the main drawback of the RANS framework. With the rapid development of data-driven approaches, many data-driven turbulence models have been proposed, yet they still suffer from issues of generalizability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a few-shot, physically restorable, symbolic regression turbulence model based on the normalized general effective-viscosity hypothesis. Few-shot indicates that our model is trained on limited flow configurations spanning only a narrow subset of turbulent flow physics, yet can still outperform the baseline model in substantially different turbulent flows. Physically restorable means our model can nearly revert to the baseline model in regimes satisfying specific physical conditions, using only the symbolic regression training results. The normalized general effective-viscosity hypothesis was proposed in our previous study. Specifically, we first formalize the concept of few-shot data-driven turbulence models. Second, we train our symbolic regression turbulence models using only direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for three-dimensional periodic hill flow slices. Third, we evaluate our models on periodic hill flows, zero pressure gradient flat plate flow, NACA0012 airfoil flows, and NASA Rotor 37 transonic axial compressor flows. One of our symbolic regression turbulence models consistently outperforms the baseline model, and we further demonstrate that this model can nearly revert to baseline behavior in certain flow regimes.</description>

      <title>High-resolution numerical simulations of turbulent non-catalytic reverse water gas shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.
  The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.
  It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Turbulence on Hydroacoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon our first paper [Hu, K.X, &amp; Hu, Y. J. (2025). Hydroacoustic Absorption and Amplification by Turbulence, arXiv:2512.07920], the present work conducts a more in-depth investigation into the impact of turbulence on hydroacoustic waves. The study includes the influences of temperature, unsteady laminar flow, standing wave effects, the alteration of phase, the variation of amplification factor with frequency, and the temporal evolution of the acoustic wave. Experiments indicate that the temperature rise caused by friction between the turbulent flow and the pipe wall does not significantly affect the acoustic wave, and therefore is not the primary cause of changes in wave amplitude. When two transducers are placed opposite each other, the acoustic waves can be regarded as a superposition of traveling waves and standing waves. When the pump is shut down after the pipe flow has stabilized, the temporal evolution of the acoustic waves during the subsequent turbulence decay process can be classified into six types. In addition to altering the amplitude, turbulence also changes the phase of waves. The total phase shift of the acoustic wave along the entire pipe equals the sum of the phase shifts in each segment. Both the amplification factor and the phase shift due to turbulence vary periodically with frequency. Experiments for low-frequency waves show that acoustic waves with frequencies below a certain threshold are not affected by turbulence. These findings suggest that the interaction between hydroacoustic waves and turbulence constitutes stimulated emission in water.</description>

      <title>Fully coupled implicit finite-volume algorithm for viscoelastic interfacial flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully coupled implicit finite-volume algorithm for incompressible viscoelastic interfacial flows is proposed, whereby the viscoelasticity of the flow is described by an upper-convected Maxwell constitutive model, including limited extensibility and shear-thinning behaviour. The governing equations describing the conservation of continuity and momentum, as well as the constitutive model are discretized using standard finite-volume methods and are solved for pressure, velocity and the polymer stress tensor in a single linear system of equations. Treating all terms of the linearized and discretized governing equations implicit in velocity, pressure and/or the components of the polymer stress tensor, a tightly coupled system of equations is obtained. The interface separating the interacting bulk phases and the surface tension acting at the fluid interface are modelled using a state-of-the-art front-tracking method. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed numerical framework with four representative test cases, including the deformation of a viscoelastic droplet in shear flow at large Weissenberg numbers of up to Wi=10^4, and the jump discontinuity of the rise velocity of a bubble rising in a viscoelastic liquid as a result of a "negative wake". Contrary to previous studies using segregated algorithms, the proposed fully coupled implicit algorithm does not apply or require a log-conformation approach to predict these flows. Overall, the fully implicit coupled front-tracking formulation provides a robust framework to reliable numerical predictions of strongly elastic interfacial flows at large Weissenberg numbers.</description>

      <title>On the vortex transport and blade interactions in a reversible pump-turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pumped storage type hydropower plants play an important role in mitigating real-time energy flexibility. Reversible pump-turbines undergo extreme operating conditions such as runaway and speed-no-load. Very limited studies are undertaken to understand the stochastic flow under these conditions in the reversible pump-turbine. The present study investigates the unsteady vortical flow, its transportation, and interaction with the blades at speed-no-load. Large eddy simulations are conducted in both turbine and pump modes. The computational domain contains 120 million nodes. Numerical results provided evidence of a large longitudinal vortex that develops on the high-pressure side of the blade, and transports into the blade passage and develops the unsteady "string of swirls". The results also showed another "string of swirls" in the draft tube, where flow in the center is reversible (pumping). The resulting flow instability is very high, and it has the potential to induce fatigue damage to the blades.</description>

      <title>Small Rarefaction, Large Consequences: Limits of Navier Stokes Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct numerical simulations of rocket plume impingement on a lunar landing surface using two complementary frameworks: the Boltzmann equation, which naturally captures rarefied gas dynamics, and the Navier Stokes (NS) equations, the conventional workhorse for turbulent flow simulations. We show that subtle rarefaction effects, long considered negligible in turbulent regimes, can become locally dominant within shear layers where viscous stresses predicted by the NS constitutive relation undergo sign reversals. This phenomenon, which we term constitutive degeneracy, produces order-one relative errors in predicted surface shear stress and heat flux. Our results demonstrate that turbulence can expose hidden limits of NS equations with broad implications for high-speed aerodynamics and planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>A melting mode of frozen sessile droplets with unmelted ice layer deposited at the bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-repellent properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for anti-icing and deicing applications. Through experimental visualization of frozen sessile droplets undergoing melting on superhydrophobic surfaces, we identify a melting mode with the unmelted ice layer deposited at the bottom of the melting droplet, even though the density of ice is lower than that of water. In the deposited mode of the melting process, the time required for the frozen droplet to melt completely is much shorter than that in the floating mode. Force analysis shows that the melted fluid flows along the gas-liquid interface toward the top of the melting droplet, thereby exerting force and then suppressing the upward movement of the unmelted ice layer. Moreover, the flow within the liquid film formed between the unmelted ice layer and the heating wall is dominated by the viscous force, which has a lubrication effect and maintains the deposition of the unmelted ice layer. High heating temperature, large contact angle, and low particle concentration are helpful for the occurrence of the deposited mode.</description>

      <title>Dimensional regimes in Kolmogorov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimensionality of two-dimensional Kolmogorov flows over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and forcing wavenumbers $k_f=\{2,4,8\}$ using two complementary approaches: convolutional autoencoders and a Kaplan-Yorke estimation based on Lyapunov analysis. As the Reynolds number increases, two distinct transitions are observed: the first corresponds to the destabilization of a periodic orbit, while the second marks the saturation of the large-scale motions. When expressed in terms of the forcing Reynolds number, these transitions occur at nearly the same value for all forcing wavenumbers, suggesting a universal scaling with respect to the forcing scale. By filtering the data to retain only the large-scale range ($k &lt; k_f$), we show that the dimensionality estimated by the autoencoders also saturates at the second transition, implying that once the large scales are fully developed, the subsequent increase in dynamical activity occurs predominantly at smaller scales. At higher Reynolds numbers, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension ceases to grow, revealing its limited sensitivity to the nonlinear interactions that dominate in this regime. Both the Kaplan-Yorke saturation dimension and the filtered large-scale dimensionalities exhibit a linear dependence on $k_f$, indicating that the number of active degrees of freedom scales with the forcing scale rather than with the total number of available Fourier modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time materials are obtained by modulating a physical medium with a traveling-wave perturbation of one or several of its constitutive parameters, such as the density or the bulk modulus in the case of acoustic materials. When this modulation has the form of a moving and abrupt (subwavelength) transition between two parameter values, we refer to a spatio-temporal interface, which may be considered as a building block for more complex space-time materials. This work considers the problem interaction and scattering of acoustic waves with a single spatio-temporal interface, and a sequence of two interfaces forming a slab. Several regimes defined by the relation between the sound propagation velocities and the interface velocity (namely subsonic, intersonic, and supersonic regimes) are discussed. Analytical expressions for the frequency conversions and scattering coefficients are obtained, and compared with numerical simulations based on an equivalent FTFD squeme.</description>

      <title>Constitutive flow law for hydrogel granular rafts near the brittle-ductile transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying flow laws have been identified in dry granular flow, yet their applicability to unjammed suspensions remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the quasistatic suspension flow combines dry granular rheology with nonlocal effects in the shear band and damped viscous flow in the outer creep region. Through rotary shear experiments on a hydrogel granular raft, we observe that the flow decays from the interface in the quasistatic regime, where the particles remain mobile even below the yield stress. These findings suggest the universal flow law across the transition between jammed/brittle granular behavior and unjammed/ductile viscous flow.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</description>

      <title>Component-wise dimensionally reduced flows and helicity conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved, with a no-go theorem of transforming all one type of real Schur matrices into the other type by the same (orthogonal) transformation, that the so-called real Schur flows (RSFs) corresponding to the two types of uniformly real Schur form velocity gradient matrices are different; on the other hand, the further component-wise dimensionally reduced ``lone Schur flow (LSF)'' is unique in the sense that simple uniform transformations such as the switch of the coordinate axes are sufficient to unify them. One type of RSFs can have closed streamlines only on the equilibrium planes of the velocity component dimensionally reduced to be one-dimensonal. The theorem of no closed streamlines in LSFs leads to a simple (re)definition of ``vortex'' and ``swirl''. Not all component-wise dimensionally reduced flows (CWDRFs) associated to the Euler equation correspond to an invariant manifold of the latter, but the ``intersection" of the two types of RSFs do. Previous proofs, by Moffatt and by Khesin \&amp; Chekanov, of the helicity invariance in barotropic ideal flows were overkilling in the sense of using the unnecessary condition of local mass conservation, while our new ``sharper'' proof without invoking the latter carries over to CWDRFs.</description>

      <title>Integral modelling and Reinforcement Learning control of 3D liquid metal coating on a moving substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic coatings are used to enhance the durability of metal surfaces by protecting them from corrosion. These protective layers are typically deposited in a fluid state via a liquid film. Controlling instabilities in the liquid film is crucial to achieving uniform, high-quality coatings. This study explores the possibility of controlling liquid films on a moving substrate using a combination of gas jets and electromagnetic actuators. To model the 3D liquid film, we extend existing integral models to incorporate the effects of electromagnetic actuators. The control strategy was developed within a reinforcement learning framework, in which the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm interacts with the liquid film via pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators to optimise a reward function that accounts for instability-wave amplitude through a trial-and-error process. The PPO identified an optimal control law that reduced interface instabilities via a novel mechanism: gas jets push crests, and electromagnets raise troughs via the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Translational dynamics of lipid-coated microbubbles driven by ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound-driven microbubbles are increasingly being investigated for both molecular imaging and therapeutic applications. To be effective, these bubbles must be brought into close proximity or direct contact with the target site. Leveraging the acoustic radiation force provides a powerful strategy to direct their movement. In this study, we examine the translational dynamics of a microbubble with unprecedented accuracy by simultaneously time-resolving both its radial and translational responses and by using optical tweezers to study the bubble in free space. Our experimental results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the bubble sizes considered, provided the history drag force is included in the force balance. For the Reynolds numbers considered (up to Re = 2), the zero-Reynolds-number history force performs as well as its finite-Reynolds-number extension. Although non-spherical modes may arise at larger bubble expansions, they do not appear to significantly influence the bubble translational motion. A major finding is that the normalised transport distance of the bubble scales linearly with the normalised volumetric expansion during its oscillation, greatly simplifying the design and analysis of transport strategies. We also investigated bubble stability during transport and observed a marked increase in dissolution rate once a threshold in bubble expansion is exceeded. These insights can be leveraged to develop optimal transport strategies that balance both transport speed and bubble stability for targeted delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Waves drive large-scale 2D flows in rotating turbulence and cause their demise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence follows a few well-known organizational principles, rooted in conservation laws. One such principle states that a system conserving two sign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary three-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when subject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D inertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and favoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a fundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D waves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D Navier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we show that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow impose an additional conservation law: waves must conserve their helicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite invariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D motions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more restrictive and the energy transfer from the waves to the 2D flow progressively vanishes, leading to a transition between distinct classes of turbulence, from 2D-dominated to 3D-dominated wave turbulence. We derive analytical expressions for this 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and domain geometry, which show a good agreement with numerical simulations. Together, these results establish a mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more broadly, illustrate how non-linear systems sustaining waves can self-organize into anisotropic, zero-frequency structures.</description>

      <title>Reducing base drag on road vehicles using pulsed jets optimized by hybrid genetic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption. This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based optimizer, was used to determine the best-performing jet actuation parameters in an experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately 8.8%. The best-performing control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Role of partial stable stratification on the onset of rotating magnetoconvection with a uniform horizontal field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore the combined effects of partial thermal stable stratification and magnetic back-reaction within Earth's tangent cylinder, we study the onset of magnetoconvection in an infinite plane layer subject to horizontal magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the rotation axis. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors.</description>

      <title>Solving continuum and rarefied flows using differentiable programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multi-scale flows remains a formidable challenge. Constructing theoretical models and numerical methods often involves the design and optimization of parameters. While gradient descent methods have been mainly manifested to shine in the wave of deep learning, composable automatic differentiation can advance scientific computing where the application of classical adjoint methods alone is infeasible or cumbersome. Differentiable programming provides a novel paradigm that unifies data structures and control flows and facilitates gradient-based optimization of parameters in a computer program. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the first solution algorithm for multi-scale flow physics across continuum and rarefied regimes based on differentiable programming. The fully differentiable simulator provides a unified framework for the convergence of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning, i.e., scientific machine learning. Specifically, parameterized mechanical-neural flow models and numerical methods can be constructed for forward physical processes, while the parameters can be trained on the fly with the help of the gradients that are taken through the backward passes of the whole simulation program, a.k.a., end-to-end optimization. As a result, versatile data-driven modeling and simulation can be achieved for physics discovery, surrogate modeling, and simulation acceleration. The fundamentals and implementation of the solution algorithm are demonstrated in detail. Numerical experiments, including forward and inverse problems for hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the numerical method. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are available under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a three-tier machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In the first step, we employ Diffusion Maps (DMs), a nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn manifold-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and standard linear Multivariate Autoregressive models (MVARs) to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving an (ill-posed) pre-image problem via a convex interpolation based on the k-NN algorithm. In doing so, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unknown mass-constrained PDE, without explicitly identifying the PDE itself. For comparison purposes, we also evaluated the performance of the scheme for constructing ROMs based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and prove that both POD and the k-NN lifting operators preserve the mass. We illustrate the approach using two benchmark problems: (a) the Hughes model of crowd dynamics, which minimizes walking time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions, and (b) a CFD problem involving the spatio-temporal evolution of a passive tracer advected by a periodic Navier--Stokes velocity field. We show that ROMs informed by DMs yield parsimonious models that consistently outperform the best POD-informed ROMs, yielding stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the original high-dimensional space over long time horizons.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $\lambda_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $\lambda_s$, characterized by the parameters $\frac{\lambda_s}{\lambda_D}$ and $\frac{L}{\lambda_s}$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. Self-similar solutions with spatially uniform electron temperature with exponential time dependence are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface as the target interacts with the rising laser intensity envelope. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</description>
