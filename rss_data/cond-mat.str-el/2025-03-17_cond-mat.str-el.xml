      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation between simulated binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We clarify the origin of what is sometimes called the "topological anomalous Hall effect," provide analytical formulas to compute all the contributions to the Hall conductivity in the presence of Kondo-coupled spins and spin orbit coupling. The derivation is technical but we emphasize that the results can be very easily applied.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Hubbard approach to correlated materials: the case of transition-metal monoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlations beyond static mean-field theories are of fundamental importance in describing the properties of complex materials - such as transition-metal oxides - where the low-energy physics is driven by localized d or f electrons. Here, we show that it is possible to capture these correlations with a local and dynamical self energy, extending to the spin-polarized and multi-site case our recently introduced dynamical Hubbard functional formulation. We apply this formalism to the prototypical transition-metal monoxide series of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their ground state, finding excellent agreement with experiments for the spectral properties. The results are comparable or improved with respect to state-of-the-art theories, both for the densities of states and for the spectral functions - including band renormalization and spectral weight transfer - in a numerically efficient and physically transparent treatment of correlations amenable to the study of realistic, complex materials.</description>

      <title>New insight on the phase diagram of the superconducting iron spin ladder BaFe$_2$S$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ are the only two quasi-one-dimensional iron-based compounds that become superconductors under pressure. Interestingly, these two compounds exhibit different symmetries and properties. While more detailed and recent studies on BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ using single crystals have advanced the filed towards a more universal description of this family, such a study is still lacking for the compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$. Here, we present a detailed study of the crystalline and magnetic structure performed on single crystals using X-ray and neutron diffraction. We demonstrate a polar structure at room temperature within the $Cm2m$ space group, followed by a structural transition at 130 K to the polar $Pb2_1m$ space group. This space group remains unchanged across the magnetic transition at $T_N =95$ K, revealing multiferroic characteristics with a weak magnetoelastic coupling. The determined magnetic structure is monoclinic ($P_am$), with non-collinear magnetic moments, displaying a significant angle of 18$^\circ$ relative to the $a$-axis in the $(a, c)$ plane. This reexamination of the temperature-dependent properties of BaFe$_2$S$_3$ provides new insights into the physics of this system from multiple key perspectives.</description>

      <title>Bimeron Crystals by a Linearly Polarized AC Electric Field in Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method to generate topological spin textures by irradiating a classical spin system with a linearly polarized AC electric field. To this end, we investigate non-equilibrium steady states in a classical Heisenberg model with frustrated exchange interactions on a two-dimensional triangular lattice by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation at zero temperature. Our results reveal that the linearly polarized AC electric-field irradiation induces a topological phase transition from a single-Q spiral state to a bimeron crystal with the skyrmion number of one in the low-frequency regime. Furthermore, we show that the obtained bimeron crystal remains relatively stable against both easy-axis and easy-plane single-ion anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Magnetoconductivity due to electron-electron interaction in a non-Galilean--invariant Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the cRPA: A Comparative Analysis of Methods for Calculating Hubbard Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter U. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO2 (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting LaMnO3: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid quasiparticles in strain-tuned Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting electrons can form metallic states beyond the Fermi liquid paradigm, a conceptual frontier of many-body physics mainly explored via bulk thermodynamics and transport. In contrast, the microscopics of anomalous single-particle excitations underlying non-Fermi liquid properties have largely remained in the dark. Here we spectroscopically map such quantum-critical excitations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under uniaxial pressure, an experimental challenge overcome by technical advances combining focused ion beam micro-milling with laser angle resolved photoemission. We show that quasiparticle excitations acquire a non-Fermi liquid scattering rate near the critical point but remain remarkably robust throughout the transition. These experiments serve as a benchmark for the theory of anomalous metals and settle the long-standing question if quantum-critical systems host quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic ripples in the UTe2 high magnetic field phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy fermion metamagnet uranium ditelluride possesses two distinct magnetic field--induced superconducting states. One of these superconductive phases resides at magnetic fields immediately below a first-order metamagnetic transition to a field--polarized paramagnetic state at a field strength $H_m$, while the other exists predominantly above $H_m$. However, little is known about the microscopic properties of this polarized paramagnetic state. Here we report pulsed magnetic field measurements tracking the evolution of $H_m$ for polar and azimuthal inclinations in the vicinity of the crystallographic $b-a$ plane. We uncover a region of the phase diagram at high fields $&gt;$ 50 T with a ripple-like non-monotonic dependence of $H_m$ on the orientation of field. Within this ripple in the metamagnetic transition surface, $H_m$ exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence. Our results point towards the presence of complex magnetic interactions and possible magnetic sub-phases at high magnetic fields in UTe$_2$, which may have important implications for the manifestation of exotic field-induced superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality in a frustrated Haldane chain with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and three-site interactions in the presence of single-ion anisotropy. We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising transition reappears together with the distinct and exotic $c=1$ transition belonging to the eight-vertex universality class. This transition, which separates the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters - is thus a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Variational Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo Built on Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the breakdown of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the N'{e}el transition, we accurately predict the N'{e}el temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and single-particle spectral functions, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</description>

      <title>Slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the c-axis magnetoresistance of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Details of the electronic band structure in unconventional superconductors are key to the understanding of their fundamental ground state. The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: A diluted non-Kramers doublet system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ir$_2$Zn$_{20}$ is a promising candidate for exhibiting single-site quadrupolar (two-channel) Kondo effect. We have measured temperature-dependent magnetization of a sample for $x$ = 0.028 down to 0.1 K at various constant magnetic fields to extract the characteristic behaviors due to the quadrupolar Kondo effect. The Curie--Weiss fit to the magnetic susceptibility between 50 and 300 K yields a negative paramagnetic Curie temperature of $-$7.0 K, indicative of on-site antiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization divided by magnetic field, $M(T)/B$, at $B = 0.5$ T is saturated to a constant value below 3 K. On the contrary, in higher magnetic fields of $B$ = 1 and 2 T, $M(T)/B$ exhibits $-$ln$T$ dependence from 1 to 0.1 K, which temperature dependence is consistent with that of the quadrupolar susceptibility detected from ultrasonic measurements. The $-$ln$T$ form of $M(T)/B$ appears to reflect the behavior of quadrupolar susceptibility, through the magnetic-field-induced magnetic moment due to the mixing of the non-Kramers doublet and crystalline-electric-field excited states of Pr$^{3+}$. In $B$ = 4 T, $M(T)/B$ approaches a constant on cooling below 0.3 K, because of the quenching of the quadrupoles in the field-induced singlet ground state.</description>

      <title>Tuning Charge Order in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate tuning in both directions across a second-order ferroelectric phase transition via uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Bosonized 1D quantum systems through enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Keldysh pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group for quantum magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for spin models relying on a pseudo-fermionic description has proven to be a powerful technique in simulating ground state properties of strongly frustrated magnetic lattices. A drawback of the FRG framework is that it is formulated in the imaginary-time Matsubara formalism and thus only able to access static correlations, a limitation shared with most other many-body approaches. A description of the dynamical properties of magnetic systems is the key to bridging the gap between theory and neutron scattering spectra. We take the decisive step of expanding the scope of pseudo-fermion FRG to the Keldysh formalism, which, while originally developed to address non-equilibrium phenomena, enables a direct calculation of the equilibrium dynamical spin structure factors on generic lattices in arbitrary dimension. We identify the principal features characterizing the low-energy spectra of exemplary zero-, one- and two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models as well as the Kitaev honeycomb model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Hubbard Model on the Bethe Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice with a coordination number of 3 using the thermal canonical tree tensor network method. Our findings reveal two distinct thermodynamic phases: a low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase, where spin SU(2) symmetry is broken, and a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. A key feature of the system is the separation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity between spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities. At the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit singularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from their spin counterparts. Additionally, the double occupancy number exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of an entropy-driven Pomeranchuk effect. These results demonstrate that the loopless Bethe lattice effectively captures the essential physics of the Hubbard model while providing a computationally efficient framework for studying strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to the hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantized Spin-Hall Conductivity in Altermagnet Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with Mirror-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), crucial for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity has not yet been reported in QSH insulators and other realistic materials. Here, we tackle this challenge by predicting robust quantized spin-Hall conductivity in monolayer Fe$_2$Te$_2$O. The underlying physics originates from the unrecognized mirror-spin coupling (MSC), which couples spin-up and spin-down states into two orthogonal mirror eigenstates. We show that the MSC can naturally emerge in the two-dimensional altermagnets with out-of-plane N\'eel vector and horizontal mirror. A remarkable consequence of the MSC is that it can dramatically weaken the spin hybridization of the altermagnetic materials when SOC is included. When SOC is neglected, Fe$_2$Te$_2$O is an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal with MSC. With SOC, it evolves into the first material candidate for magnetic mirror Chern insulator. Remarkably, under the protection of MSC, the spin hybridization of both bulk and topological edge states in Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with SOC at low energy is negligible. As a consequence, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity emerges within the bulk band gap of the system. By unveiling a novel effect, our findings represent a significant advancement in spin Hall transport, and broaden the material candidates hosting intriguing altermagnetic phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.</description>

      <title>Chirality, magic, and quantum correlations in multipartite quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of chirality for generic quantum states. A chiral state is defined as a state which cannot be transformed into its complex conjugate in a local product basis using local unitary operations. We introduce a number of quantitative measures of chirality which vanish for non-chiral states. A faithful measure called the "chiral log-distance" is defined in terms of the maximum fidelity between the state and its complex conjugate under local unitary transformations. We further introduce a set of computable measures that involve nested commutators of modular Hamiltonians. We show general relations between chirality and the amount of "magic" or non-stabilizer resource in a state. We first show that stabilizer states of qubits are non-chiral. Furthermore, magic monotones such as the stabilizer nullity and the stabilizer fidelity are lower-bounded by the chiral log-distance. We further relate chirality to discord-like quantum correlations. We define a measure of discord-like correlations called the intrinsic interferometric power, and show that it is lower-bounded by a nested commutator chirality measure. One interesting aspect of chirality is that it is not monotonic under local partial traces, indicating that it is a unique kind of resource that is not captured by traditional quantum resource theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</description>

      <title>Atomic Altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N\'eel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N\'eel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42{\deg} and 26{\deg} respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N\'eel order of local dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Mutliwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

Abstract: Given a known or unknown phase encoded in a higher-dimensional qudit gate, it is possible to send copies of a gate that encodes the phase to multiple receivers based on a generalized quantum teleportation. We extend this quantum gate broadcast protocol to a quantum network on directed acyclic graphs in which agents can add phase gates to be distributed and pass unknown phase gates to subsequent receivers. Similarly to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, we show that the resource state can be efficiently prepared in finite time.</description>

Abstract: Perovskite-type iron oxides with Fe4+ ions have attracted much attention for their versatile helimagnetic phases. While the introduction of a layered A-site ordered structure to AFeO3 with Fe4+ ions potentially lead to novel helimagnetic phases, the synthetic pathway spanning high pressure range is apparently difficult to elucidate. Here, we explored new A-site ordered perovskite-type iron oxides (Ca,Ba)FeO3-{\delta} with Fe4+ ions with the support of first-principles calculations evaluating thermodynamic stability at selected pressures and chemical compositions. Among the six types of putative A-site ordered perovskites with and without oxygen vacancy, only two types of oxygen-deficient perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~1) were successfully obtained by high-pressure synthesis, being consistent with the DFT-based convex-hull calculations. Considering the evaluated stability of the putative perovskites at selected pressures, we adopted low-temperature topotactic oxidation using ozone at ambient pressure and obtained the oxidized perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.4) and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.6), potentially showing novel helimagnetic phases. This study demonstrates that computational visualization of multi-step synthetic pathways involving high pressure can accelerate the search for new metastable perovskites with rich magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Observation of High-Temperature Dissipationless Fractional Chern Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect has recently been experimentally observed in zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCI). However, an outstanding challenge is the presence of a substantial longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ (a few k$\Omega$), even though the anomalous Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is quantized. This dissipative behavior is likely linked to imperfect sample quality. Here, we report transport measurements of a drastically improved twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ bilayer device, which exhibits quantized $R_{xy}$ and vanishing $R_{xx}$ for the $-2/3$ state, marking a dissipationless FCI. Contrary to fractional quantum Hall states where the energy gap increases with magnetic field, we find that the thermal activation gap of the observed FCI states decreases rapidly as the magnetic field rises from zero, then plateaus above a few teslas. This observation is attributed to the interplay between spin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap dominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the magnetic field freezes spin fluctuations. For the $-2/3$ state, we estimate the spin and FCI gap of about 55 and 20 K, respectively. Our results provide insights into the energy scale of FCI and offer a pathway for quantum engineering of exotic correlated topological states.</description>

      <title>A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interaction be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction overlap is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments. This work opens a reliable pathway to search for topological superconductors with high-$T_c$ (relative to $\epsilon_F$) in materials with strongly interactions. We summarize the requirements and suggest some illustrative design structures.</description>

      <title>Stark difference in the in-plane anomalous Hall response in Zintl compounds EuA2Sb2 (A = Zn, Cd) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2Sb2 has drawn attention to out-of-plane orbital magnetization induced by an in-plane field component. Here we study EuZn2Sb2, a sister compound of EuCd2Sb2, to demonstrate sensitive changes of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect on the band modulation. The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. \a245\ phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to \neelfm\ phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of $c$-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the \neelfm\ phase is a rare example of {\it intrinsic} altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. The existence of this phase may resulting in nontrivial effect on the re-emerging superconducting phase of \kfsxy\ under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.</description>

      <title>2-Form U(1) Spin Liquids: Classical Model and Quantum Aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel geometrically frustrated classical Ising model, dubbed the "spin vorticity model", whose ground state manifold is a novel classical spin liquid, a "2-form Coulomb phase". We study the thermodynamics of this model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations. Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed 2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions, from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent 2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form gauge-Higgs model. We discuss the stability of the gapless deconfined phase of this gauge theory and the possibility of realizing a novel class of phases of quantum matter: 2-form U(1) quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Dark Metastable Conduction Channels near a Metal-Insulator Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Kitaev model on the $\{9,3\}$ hyperbolic lattice. The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular 3-coordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.</description>

      <title>Probing moir\'e electronic structures through quasiparticle interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices are a general feature of bilayer structures, where an additional periodic superstructure is generated by either lattice mismatch or from a twist angle. They have been shown to stabilise new ground states, including unconventional superconductivity and Mott insulating phases, attributed to strong electron correlations. However, controlling these interactions requires a detailed understanding of the low energy electronic structure which is lacking so far. Probing the electronic structure is challenging due to sample inhomogeneity, the low characteristic energy scales involved and small sample sizes. Through quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) can overcome many of these challenges but requires detailed modelling to extract the $k$-space electronic structure. Here, we present realistic calculations of QPI in twisted bilayer structures, which accounts for the effect of the long range moir\'e lattice on the electronic structure as well as it's interaction at a defect. These calculations reveal that while the moir\'e supercell significantly reduces the size of the Brillouin zone, the QPI scattering vectors retain characteristics of the individual monolayers with distinct perturbations from the twisted geometry that can be directly linked back to the electronic structure. The procedure introduced here provides a general framework to use QPI to determine the low energy electronic structure in moir\'e lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals: The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of single crystals of the ruthenium-dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ using magnetic susceptibility and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements. While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Towards a global phase diagram of Ce-based dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets under magnetic fields</title>

Abstract: Recent experiments have established a strong case for Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$ to host $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). However, an irrefutable conclusion still requires strong, multifaceted evidence. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) compounds, external magnetic fields only strongly couple with the dipolar component $\tau_z$ along its local z-axis in contrast to octupolar components $\tau^{x,y}$. This gives rise to the unique ways magnetic fields interact with the system and, in turn, provides us with a variety of tuning knobs to generate comprehensive experimental results. In this work, we focus on magnetic fields along the (110), (111), and (001) directions and present a plethora of remarkable experimental signatures to probe the underlying physics of $\pi$-flux QSI using gauge mean field theory (GMFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we present unique signatures in magnetic field-dependent phase diagrams, equal-time and dynamical structure factors, and magnetostriction.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence for spin-spinless stripe order with reduced Ni moments within $ab$ plane for bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ probed by $^{139}$La-NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ have been selectively investigated by nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) at the La(2) site outside the NiO$_2$ bilayers. The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>A quantum critical line bounds the high field metamagnetic transition surface in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three Cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits a magnetic field-induced superconducting state in a toroidal shape, which persists to fields over 70~T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of hybrid light-matter excitations in cavity QED materials using the Dicke-Ising model as a theoretical framework. Leveraging linear response theory, we derive the exact excitations of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Our results demonstrate that the cavity can localize spin excitations, leading to the formation of bound polaritons, where the cavity acts as an impurity of the two-excitation band, localizing spin-wave pairs around single-spin domains. We derive the condition for the existence of these bound states and discuss its satisfiability in different regimes. Finally, we show that these effects persist in finite systems using exact-diagonalization calculations.</description>

      <title>Linear response theory for cavity QED materials at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.</description>

Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$ (YBCO), where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a \textit{local} superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We show how this scenario can fit most of the available data. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. While the bulk of this paper addresses the experiment on YBCO, this work reveals a new instability in the sine-Gordon equation that is of fundamental interest, with potential applications such as providing a mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales in Josephson devices.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find that its non-analytic temporal behaviour is close but does not match exactly the vanishing of the order parameter. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Cooper pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moir\'e heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is well benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</description>
