      <title>Bounds on Arithmetic Rainbow Ramsey Multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantitative Ramsey-type problem on 3-term arithmetic progressions: how should the set of integers $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ be colored using 3 colors in order to maximize the number of rainbow 3-term arithmetic progressions? By "rainbow", we mean progressions whose elements are each assigned a distinct color. We determine a lower bound for this question and upper and lower bounds when $[n]$ is replaced with the integers modulo $n$, including an exact maximum when $n$ is a multiple of 3.</description>

      <title>Online Ramsey numbers of the claw versus cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online Ramsey number $\tilde r(G,H)$ is defined via a Builder--Painter game on an empty graph with countably many vertices. In each round, Builder reveals an edge, which Painter immediately colors either red or blue. Builder wins once a red copy of $G$ or a blue copy of $H$ appears, and $\tilde r(G,H)$ is the minimum number of edges Builder must reveal to force a win.
  For a long cycle $C_\ell$, the online Ramsey numbers $\tilde r(G,C_\ell)$ are known only for a few specific choices of $G$. In particular, exact values were determined for $G=P_3$ by Cyman, Dzido, Lapinskas, and Lo (Electron. J. Combin., 2015), while asymptotically tight results were obtained when $G$ is an even cycle by Adamski, Bednarska-Bzd\c{e}ga, and Bla\v{z}ej (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2024). In this paper, we consider the case where $G$ is the claw $K_{1,3}$ and determine the exact value of $\tilde r(K_{1,3},C_\ell)$. We show that \[ \tilde r(K_{1,3},C_\ell)=\left\lfloor \frac{3(\ell+1)}{2} \right\rfloor \quad \text{for all } \ell \ge 13. \]</description>

      <title>Staircase hook-length ratios and special values of Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate hook-length products for adjacent staircase partitions to special values of Jacobi polynomials. This connection expresses the number of semistandard tableaux in terms of Jacobi polynomials defined via Gauss hypergeometric functions. From this identity, we derive the special values of stable Grothendieck polynomials and $K$-theoretic Schur $P$-functions indexed by adjacent staircase partitions. These values provide ratios of the numbers of set-valued and shifted set-valued semistandard tableaux. This connection is further clarified by the theory of excited Young diagrams, which characterizes the coefficients in these specializations.</description>

      <title>Tree versus tree of preorder induced by rainbow forbidden subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subgraph $H$ of an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if all the edges of $H$ receive different colors. If $G$ does not contain a rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $H$, we say that $G$ is rainbow $H$-free. For connected graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, if there exists an integer $t=t(H_1,H_2)$ such that every rainbow $H_1$-free edge-colored complete graph colored with $t$ or more colors is rainbow $H_2$-free, then we write $H_1\le H_2$. The binary relation $\le$ is reflexive and transitive, and hence it is a preorder. For graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, we write $H_1 \equiv H_2$ if both $H_1 \le H_2$ and $H_2 \le H_1$ hold. Then $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation. If $H_1$ is a subgraph of $H_2$, then trivially $H_1\le H_2$ holds. On the other hand, there exists a pair $(H_1, H_2)$ such that $H_1$ is a proper supergraph of $H_2$ and $H_1\le H_2$ holds. Q.~Cui, Q.~Liu, C.~Magnant and A.~Saito [Discrete Math. {\bf 344} (2021) Article Number 112267] characterized these pairs. %On the other hand, there are few known results regarding the study of $\leq$ for the incomparable with respect to $\subseteq$. Cui et al. found pairs of graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ such that $H_1 \leq H_2$ and $H_2 \leq H_1$, that is, non-singleton equivalence class with respect to $\le$. However, we have not found any other non-singleton equivalence class with respect to $\le$ except for those discovered by Cui et al.
  In this paper. we investigate the existence of non-singleton equivalence class with respect to $\le$ by focusing on trees.</description>

      <title>Isospectral Cayley graphs with even and odd spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and subsets $S,T \subset G$ we introduce the mirror di-Cayley graph $MX(G;S,T)$ and mirror di-Cayley sum graph $MX^+(G;S,T)$ with connections sets $S$ and $T$ (MDCGs for short). We refer to them indistinctly by $MX^*(G;S,T)$. We then consider the family $\mathcal{F}$ of those MDCGs with $T \in \mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S}= \big\{ \{e\}, S, S \cup \{e\} \big\}$.
  We compute the spectra of the graphs $MX^*(G;S,T)$, with $T \in \mathcal{S}$, in terms of those of the corresponding Cayley graphs $X^*(G,S)$. We show that if $X(G,S)$ has integral spectrum then $MX^*(G;S,T)$ is also integral for any $T \in \mathcal{S}$, but $MX^*(G;S,S)$ has even spectrum (all even eigenvalues) and $MX^*(G;S,S \cup \{e\})$ has odd spectrum (all odd eigenvalues), an interesting phenomenom which seems to be new. We then study isospectrality between different pairs of MDCGs in terms of the isospectrality of the underlying Cayley graphs.
  Finally, using unitary Cayley graphs $X(R,R^*)$ over a finite commutative ring $R$, which is known to be integral, we construct pairs of integral isospectral mirror di-Cayley (sum) graphs $\{ MX(R;R^*, T), MX^+(R;R^*, T) \}$, both with even (resp.\@ odd) spectrum for $T=R^*$ (resp.\@ $T=R^* \cup \{0\}$). All these examples can be seen as Cayley (sum) graphs over $G=R \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, hence obtaining pairs of even and odd isospectral Cayley graphs of the form $\{\Gamma, \Gamma^+\}$.</description>

      <title>Hook-Length Biases in $t$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of work on combinatorial inequalities related to hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions. In this short note, we give a proof using generating functions for a result proved by Singh and Barman (2026) using combinatorial methods. In addition, we give an alternate proof of another result of Singh \&amp; Barman (2024) which yields as a corollary a previously unobserved connection of hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions with certain distinct parts partitions.</description>

      <title>Multipath complexes of bidirectional polygonal digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the homotopy type of multipath complexes of bidirectional path graphs and polygons, motivated by works of Vre\'cica and \v{Z}ivaljevi\'c on cycle-free chessboard complexes (that is, multipath complexes of complete digraphs). In particular, we show that bidirectional path graphs are homotopic to spheres and that, in analogy with cycle-free chessboard complexes, multipath complexes of bidirectional polygonal digraphs are highly connected. Using a Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence, we provide a computation of the associated homology groups. We study T-operations on graphs, and show that this corresponds to taking suspensions of multipath complexes. We further discuss (non) shellability properties of such complexes, and present new open questions.</description>

      <title>Canonical Lattices and Integer Relations Associated to Rational Fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a canonical local-to-global lattice theory for rational fans. We define the $\textit{ray lattice } L_{\mathrm{rays}}(\Sigma)$ and the $\textit{relation lattice } L_{\mathrm{rel}}(\Sigma)$ as invariants functorial under fan isomorphisms. We introduce $\textit{star-local relation lattices}$, defined via the relation lattice of the localized quotient fan, which capture the linear dependencies visible within local neighborhoods. We define a $\textit{codimension filtration}$ on the global relation lattice and prove a generation theorem: the global lattice is generated by local relations supported on the stars of cones of codimension at least 1. This filtration is sensitive to the facial structure of $\Sigma$; explicit examples and a conjecture suggest that subdivisions can only preserve or lower filtration depths, distinguishing fans with different combinatorial topologies.</description>

      <title>Small counterexamples to the fat minor conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We narrow the gap between the family of graphs that do and the family of graphs that do not satisfy the fat minor conjecture by obtaining much simpler counterexamples than were previously known, including $K_t, t \geq 6$ and $K_{s,t}, s,t \geq 4$ and $K_{2,2,2}$.
  This is achieved by establishing a `coarse self-similarity' property of the graphs used by Nguyen, Scott and Seymour to disprove the `coarse Menger conjecture'. This property may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Structural and extremal properties of $l_1$-Fiedler value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic connectivity $a(G)$, defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix $L(G)$, admits a well-known variational characterization involving the minimization of a quadratic form subject to an $\ell_{2}$-norm constraint. In a recent work, Andrade and Dahl (2024) proposed an analogous formulation based on the $\ell_{1}$-norm, leading to the introduction of a new graph parameter $b(G)$, referred to as the $l_1$-Fiedler value. In this article, we undertake a detailed investigation of the structural and extremal properties of $b(G)$. We first derive a Nordhaus--Gaddum type inequality for $b(G)$. For trees, we determine both global maximizer and minimizers of $b(G)$, and present extremal constructions for trees with prescribed diameter, maximum degree, and number of pendant vertices. We further establish a connection between $b(G)$ and Laplacian matrices, and obtain a bound for $b(G)$ in terms of the edge connectivity, along with a complete characterization of the graphs attaining equality. We derive an explicit formula that describes the behaviour of $b(G)$ under the addition of pendant vertices. We also investigate the connection between $b(G)$ and the isoperimetric number.</description>

      <title>On Edge-Disjoint Maximal Outerplanar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two constructions for $t$ edge-disjoint maximal outerplanar graphs on every number of $n \geq 4t$ vertices. The bound on the minimum number of vertices is tight. These constructions yield the existence of optimal outerthickness-$t$ graphs for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$. While one of the constructions works for all values of $t$ and extends graphs from Guy and Nowakowski (1990), the other one holds only for powers of $2$, but yields graphs with maximum degree logarithmic in the number of vertices. Thus, the latter may be helpful in tackling the open question of determining the outerthickness of all complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Weisfeiler-Leman on graphs of small twin-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-width is a graph parameter introduced in the context of first-order model checking, and has since become a central parameter in algorithmic graph theory. While many algorithmic problems become easier on arbitrary classes of bounded twin-width, graph isomorphism on graphs of twin-width 4 and above is as hard as the general isomorphism problem. For each positive number $k$, the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is an iterative color refinement algorithm that encodes structural similarities and serves as a fundamental tool for distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. We show that the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 1 can be solved by the purely combinatorial 3-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, while there is no fixed $k$ such that the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm solves the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 4.
  Moreover, we prove the conjecture of Bergougnoux, Gajarsk\'y, Guspiel, Hlinen\'y, Pokr\'yvka, and Sokolowski that stable graphs of twin-width 2 have bounded rank-width. This in particular implies that isomorphism of these graphs can be decided by a fixed dimension of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>Repetition in Permutation Wordle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a game of permutation wordle, a player attempts to guess a secret permutation in the fewest number of guesses possible. Previously, Samuel Kutin and Lawren Smithline (arXiv:2408.00903) introduced this game and proposed a strategy called cyclic shift, which they conjecture performs optimally. We continue our investigation of this conjecture by considering how information is obtained and, at times, repeated during a game of permutation wordle using an arbitrary strategy. This analysis includes several algorithms to construct a secret permutation which prompts inefficient repetition according to the player's strategy, as well as proofs of their efficacy.</description>

      <title>A Hal\'asz-type theorem for permutation anticoncentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ of real numbers and real coefficients $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, consider the distribution of the sum obtained by pairing the $a_i$'s with the $b_i$'s according to a uniformly random permutation. A recent theorem of Pawlowski shows that as soon as the coefficients are not all equal, this distribution is always spread out at scale $n^{-1}$: no single value can occur with probability larger than $\frac{1}{2\lceil n/2\rceil + 1}$, and this bound is sharp in general.
  We show that stronger anticoncentration holds when the coefficients have additional diversity. We quantify the structure of the coefficient multiset by a simple statistic depending on its multiplicity profile, and prove that the maximum point mass of the permuted sum decays polynomially faster as this statistic grows. In particular, when the coefficients are all distinct we obtain a bound of $n^{-5/2+o(1)}$, which can be regarded as an analogue of a classical theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Moser.</description>

      <title>Local generation of languages: the monotonic binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous article, we have introduced the problem of local generation of languages, where the communication underlying the generation procedure is captured by a simplicial complex. We study in details this problem for the language of binary monotonic sequences. We prove general results and identify several classes of minimal simplicial complexes generating this language.</description>

      <title>Note on edge expansion and modularity in preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge expansion is a parameter indicating how well-connected a graph is. It is useful for designing robust networks, analysing random walks or information flow through a network and is an important notion in theoretical computer science. Modularity is a measure of how well a graph can be partitioned into communities and is widely used in clustering applications. We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \geq 2$ edges added per step. We establish new bounds for the likely edge expansion for both random models. Using bounds for edge expansion of small subsets of vertices, we derive new upper bounds also for the modularity values for small $h$.</description>

      <title>Game connectivity and adaptive dynamics in many-action games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the typical structure of games in terms of their connectivity properties. A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-\zeta_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $\zeta_n&gt;0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $\zeta_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle. We thus complement our previous work to provide a more complete picture of game connectivity across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of intersection graphs of $x$-monotone curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A curve in the plane is $x$-monotone if every vertical line intersects it at most once. A family of curves are called pseudo-segments if every pair of them have at most one point in common. We construct $2^{\Omega(n^{4/3})}$ families, each consisting of $n$ labelled $x$-monotone pseudo-segments such that their intersection graphs are different. On the other hand, we show that the number of such intersection graphs is at most $2^{O(n^{4/3}\log^2n)}$. Our proof uses a new upper bound on the number of set systems of size $m$ on a ground set of size $n$, with VC-dimension at most $d$. Much better upper bounds are obtained if we only count bipartite intersection graphs, or, in general, intersection graphs with bounded chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.
  In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>Biases in Non-Unitary Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of parity bias in integer partitions has been studied by several authors. We continue this study here, but for non-unitary partitions (namely, partitions with parts greater than $1$). We prove analogous results for these restricted partitions to those that have been obtained by Kim, Kim, and Lovejoy (2020) and Kim and Kim (2021). We also look at inequalities between two classes of partitions studied by Andrews (2019), where the parts are separated by parity (either all odd parts are smaller than all even parts or vice versa).</description>

      <title>Quadratically enriched binomial coefficients over a finite field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ ring homomorphisms into an algebraic closure from an \'etale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugall\'e and the second-named author, building on work of Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>Random convex chains through the lens of analytic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. The lower boundary of the convex hull of $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, together with $n$ independent uniformly distributed random points in $T$, is called a random convex chain and denoted by $T_n$. We study the random variable $f_0(T_n)$, the number of vertices of this chain. Our first result gives an explicit expression for the bivariate generating function of the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$ in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Building on this analytic representation, we apply a careful singularity analysis to derive a variety of limit theorems for $f_0(T_n)$, including a quantitative central limit theorem, a large deviation principle as well as a precise asymptotics for the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$. Conceptually, our results establish a novel bridge between stochastic geometry and methods from analytic combinatorics.</description>
