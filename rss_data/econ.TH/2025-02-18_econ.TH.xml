      <title>Narrow Bracketing and Risk in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite normal-form games under a narrow bracketing assumption: when players play several games simultaneously, they consider each one separately. We show that under mild additional assumptions, players must play either Nash equilibria, logit quantal response equilibria, or their generalizations, which capture players with various risk attitudes.</description>

      <title>Strategic Wealth Accumulation Under Transformative AI Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes how expectations of Transformative AI (TAI) affect current economic behavior by introducing a novel mechanism where automation redirects labor income from workers to those controlling AI systems, with the share of automated labor controlled by each household depending on their wealth at the time of invention. Using a modified neoclassical growth model calibrated to contemporary AI timeline forecasts, I find that even moderate assumptions about wealth-based allocation of AI labor generate substantial increases in pre-TAI interest rates. Under baseline scenarios with proportional wealth-based allocation, one-year interest rates rise to 10-16% compared to approximately 3% without strategic competition. The model reveals a notable divergence between interest rates and capital rental rates, as households accept lower productive returns in exchange for the strategic value of wealth accumulation. These findings suggest that evolving beliefs about TAI could create significant upward pressure on interest rates well before any technological breakthrough occurs, with important implications for monetary policy and financial stability.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning Mean Field Equilibria with Scalar Interactions: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field equilibrium (MFE) has emerged as a computationally tractable solution concept for large dynamic games. However, computing MFE remains challenging due to nonlinearities and the absence of contraction properties, limiting its reliability for counterfactual analysis and comparative statics. This paper focuses on MFE in dynamic models where agents interact through a scalar function of the population distribution, referred to as the \textit{scalar interaction function}. Such models naturally arise in a wide range of applications in operations and economics, including quality ladder models, inventory competition, online marketplaces, and heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce iterative algorithms that leverage the scalar interaction structure and are guaranteed to converge to the MFE under mild assumptions. Unlike existing approaches, our algorithms do not rely on monotonicity or contraction properties, significantly broadening their applicability. Furthermore, we provide a model-free algorithm that learns the MFE by employing simulation and reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods without requiring prior knowledge of payoff or transition functions. We establish finite-time performance bounds for this algorithm under technical Lipschitz continuity assumptions. We apply our algorithms to classic models of dynamic competition, such as capacity competition, and to competitive models motivated by online marketplaces, including ridesharing, dynamic reputation, and inventory competition, as well as to social learning models. Using our algorithms, we derive reliable comparative statics results that illustrate how key market parameters influence equilibrium outcomes in these stylized models, providing insights that could inform the design of competitive systems in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Order Flow Auction under Proposer-Builder Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the impact of the order flow auction (OFA) in the context of the proposer-builder separation (PBS) mechanism through a game-theoretic perspective. The OFA is designed to improve user welfare by redistributing maximal extractable value (MEV) to the users, in which two auctions take place: the order flow auction and the block-building auction. We formulate the OFA as a multiplayer game, and focus our analyses on the case of two competing players (builders). We prove the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game, and derive a closed-form solution by solving a quartic equation. Our result shows that the builder with a competitive advantage pays a relatively lower cost, leading to centralization in the builder space. In contrast, the proposer's shares evolve as a martingale process, which implies decentralization in the proposer (or, validator) space. Our analyses rely on various tools from stochastic processes, convex optimization, and polynomial equations. We also conduct numerical studies to corroborate our findings, and explore other features of the OFA under the PBS mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models with Uncertain Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust optimization for a large class of risk measures with ambiguity sets defined by $\phi$-divergences. The risk measures are allowed to be non-linear in probabilities, are represented by a Choquet integral possibly induced by a probability weighting function, and include many well-known examples (for example, CVaR, Mean-Median Deviation, Gini-type). Optimization for this class of robust risk measures is challenging due to their rank-dependent nature. We show that for many types of probability weighting functions including concave, convex and inverse $S$-shaped, the robust optimization problem can be reformulated into a rank-independent problem. In the case of a concave probability weighting function, the problem can be further reformulated into a convex optimization problem with finitely many constraints that admits explicit conic representability for a collection of canonical examples. While the number of constraints in general scales exponentially with the dimension of the state space, we circumvent this dimensionality curse and provide two types of upper and lower bounds algorithms.They yield tight upper and lower bounds on the exact optimal value and are formally shown to converge asymptotically. This is illustrated numerically in two examples given by a robust newsvendor problem and a robust portfolio choice problem.</description>

      <title>Efficiency in Multiple-Type Housing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multiple-type housing markets (Moulin, 1995), which extend Shapley-Scarf housing markets (Shapley and Scarf, 1974) from one dimension to higher dimensions. In this model, Pareto efficiency is incompatible with individual rationality and strategy-proofness (Konishi et al., 2001). Therefore, we consider two weaker efficiency properties: coordinatewise efficiency and pairwise efficiency. We show that these two properties both (i) are compatible with individual rationality and strategy-proofness, and (ii) help us to identify two specific mechanisms. To be more precise, on various domains of preference profiles, together with other well-studied properties (individual rationality, strategy-proofness, and non-bossiness), coordinatewise efficiency and pairwise efficiency respectively characterize two extensions of the top-trading-cycles mechanism (TTC): the coordinatewise top-trading-cycles mechanism (cTTC) and the bundle top-trading-cycles mechanism (bTTC). Moreover, we propose several variations of our efficiency properties, and we find that each of them is either satisfied by cTTC or bTTC, or leads to an impossibility result (together with individual rationality and strategy-proofness). Therefore, our characterizations can be primarily interpreted as a compatibility test: any reasonable efficiency property that is not satisfied by cTTC or bTTC could be considered incompatible with individual rationality and strategy-proofness. The external validity of our results in the context of general environments is also discussed. For multiple-type housing markets with strict preferences, our characterization of bTTC constitutes the first characterization of an extension of the prominent TTC mechanism</description>

      <title>Risk Aversion and Insurance Propensity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that this attitude is fully captured by the propensity to seize insurance opportunities. Our foundation, which applies to all probabilistically sophisticated preferences, well accords with the commonly held prudential interpretation of risk aversion that dates back to the seminal works of Arrow (1963) and Pratt (1964). In our main results, we first characterize the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion in terms of propensity to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propensity to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propensity to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propensity to partial insurance.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Reversion Strategies: Three Period Dynamic Co-operative Signalling with Sticky Efficiency Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses Nash equilibrium reversion as an optimal tool for clearing dynamic prices and wages. Various exogenous competitive rigidities determine the balanced growth path of the efficiency wage and the outcome of repeated household/firm wage bargaining decisions. A location model is used to explore the extent to which a downstream spatial cooperation agreement might affect the price equilibrium. There is also an endogenous hiring function and a knowledge base that is increasing in output as is the real wage. As the article demonstrates after accounting for real rigidities in the baseline model the effect of wage growth on household utility through staggered bargaining can be best captured by adopting a policy of point scoring on the mobility of skilled labor against the model's key rigidities. Mobility point scores which serve to encourage mobility from skilled labor within the model not only increase the knowledge base but also place upward pressure on nominal wage growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sender with private preferences would like to influence a receiver's action by providing information through a statistical test. The technology for information production is controlled by a monopolist intermediary, who offers a menu of tests and prices to screen the sender's type. We characterize the intermediary's optimal screening menu and the associated distortions, which may benefit the receiver by increasing test informativeness. Because of these distortions, seemingly unfavorable changes in the prior belief may actually benefit the sender. In extensions, we study (i) a stronger intermediary who can commit to a ``coercive'' test to punish non-participation and (ii) a weaker intermediary who cannot control test design but can charge for access.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robust regulation of labour contracts in moral hazard problems. A firm offers a contract to incentivise a worker protected by limited liability. A regulator chooses the set of permissible contracts to (i) improve efficiency and (ii) protect the worker. The regulator does not know the worker's actions and the firm's costs and evaluates regulations by their worst-case regret. The regret-minimising regulation imposes a minimum piece rate compensation for the worker: it allows all contracts above a minimum linear contract. The slope of the minimum contract balances the worker's protection and the necessary flexibility for incentive provision.</description>

      <title>Selling Multiple Items to a Unit-Demand Buyer via Automated Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the optimal (revenue-maximizing) mechanism to sell multiple items has been a prominent and notoriously difficult open problem. Existing work has mainly focused on deriving analytical results tailored to a particular class of problems (for example, Giannakopoulos (2015) and Yang (2023)). The present paper explores the possibility of a generally applicable methodology of the Automated Mechanism Design (AMD). We first employ the deep learning algorithm developed by D\"utting et al. (2023) to numerically solve small-sized problems, and the results are then generalized by educated guesswork and finally rigorously verified through duality. By focusing on a single buyer who can consume one item, our approach leads to two key contributions: establishing a much simpler way to verify the optimality of a wide range of problems and discovering a completely new result about the optimality of grand bundling. First, we show that selling each item at an identical price (or equivalently, selling the grand bundle of all items) is optimal for any number of items when the value distributions belong to a class that includes the uniform distribution as a special case. Different items are allowed to have different distributions. Second, for each number of items, we established necessary and sufficient conditions that $c$ must satisfy for grand bundling to be optimal when the value distribution is uniform over an interval $[c, c + 1]$. This latter model does not satisfy the previously known sufficient conditions for the optimality of grand bundling Haghpanah and Hartline (2021). Our results are in contrast to the only known results for $n$ items (for any $n$), Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017), which consider a single buyer with additive preferences, where the values of items are narrowly restricted to i.i.d. according to a uniform or exponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Two halves don't make a whole: instability and idleness emerging from the co-evolution of the production and innovation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a disaggregated representation of production through an agent-based fund-flow model (NGR-ADAPT) within which inefficiencies, such as factor idleness and production instability, emerge from endogenous frictions. The model incorporates productivity dynamics (learning and depreciation) and is extended with time-saving process innovations. Specifically, we assume that workers possess inherent creativity that flourishes during idle periods. The firm, rather than laying off idle workers, is assumed to exploit this potential by involving them in the innovation process. Results show that a firm's organizational and managerial decisions, the temporal structure of the production system, the speed at which workers learn and forget, and the pace of innovation are critical factors influencing production efficiency in both the short and long run. The co-evolution of production and innovation processes emerges in our model through the two-sided effects of idleness: whereas it drives skill decay it is also a condition for creative thinking that can be leveraged for innovation. In doing so, we question the utilization of labour as an adjustment variable in a productive organisation. The paper concludes by discussing potential solutions to this issue and suggesting avenues for future research.</description>
