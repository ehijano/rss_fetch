      <title>Landau theory of CeCoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both the nonmagnetic and magnetic ordered phases of CeCoSi using Landau theory. Our analysis predicts that three successive phase transitions occur at zero magnetic field. In the intermediate phase, an out-of-plane magnetic moment may be present or absent. If present, magnetic fields applied along the [100] and [110] directions induce additional magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Superzone gap formation induced by ferroic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a superzone gap, typically associated with antiferroic ordering, can also emerge from ferroic orders in systems with sublattice degrees of freedom. By analyzing a $p$-orbital tight-binding model on a zigzag chain, we show that a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger-type gap is induced by ferroquadrupolar or ferromagnetic order or by applying an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Universal non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states and density-dependent thermalization in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We support our large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</description>

      <title>Coplanar order induced by emergent frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional frustration arises from the conflict between the spin alignments due to the geometry or the nature of the interactions. Here, we demonstrate a novel form of frustration, dubbed ``emergent frustration'', which is induced by the symmetry that emerges at the phase transition point of a quantum spin model devoid of geometric frustration. We study the two-dimensional bipartite chequerboard $J$-$Q$ model, which hosts the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to the plaquette-singlet solid state (PSS) phase transition detected in the Shastry-Sutherland compound SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. By analyzing the scaling behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy with smooth boundaries at the transition point, we observe an unexpected scaling behavior, which indicates that the number of Goldstone modes is five. We explain this by proposing a novel scenario in which the system is described by an effective quantum rotor Hamiltonian with a three-sublattice geometry that frustrates collinear order while supporting coplanar order. Such a three-sublattice geometry arises from the emergent symmetry of coexisting orders, which may also occur at the AFM-PSS transition point of SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. Therefore, experimental investigations are warranted.</description>

      <title>Long-range electron coherence in Kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons lies at the core of quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical particles. Landmark experiments have revealed phase coherence of mobile electrons within solids, such as Aharonov-Bohm interference in mesoscopic rings. However, this coherence is typically limited by numerous environmental interactions. Controlling and ideally mitigating such decoherence remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic pillars of the Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ for fields applied parallel to the Kagome planes. Their periodicity is independent of materials parameters, simply given by the number of flux quanta $h/e$ threading between adjacent Kagome layers akin to an atomic-scale Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Intriguingly they occur under conditions not favorable for typical interference in solids, at temperatures above 20 K and in micrometer-scale devices well exceeding the single-particle mean free path. Further, the oscillations exhibit non-analytic field-angle dependence and scale consistently with a broad range of key electronic responses in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, pointing to a cooperative mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. Our findings provide new insights into the debated origin of correlated order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and establish Kagome metals as a promising platform for interaction-stabilized long-range electron coherence - crucial for both fundamental studies and technological advancements in quantum interference in metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in the quadruple perovskite CaCu3Re2Fe2O12</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of the A- and B-site-ordered perovskite CaCu3Re2Fe2O12 within the density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the consideration of strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+U ) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band structure method. We have calculated the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectra at the Cu, Fe, Re L2,3 and O K edges. The calculated results are in good agreement with experiment. We show that the GGA+U method produces better agreement with the experimental spectra if Hubbard U is applied to Cu and Fe sites.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in the quasi-one-dimensional dimer iridate Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$ within the density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. We have investigated the x-ray absorption spectra, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra (RIXS) at the Ir $K$, $L_3$ , $M_3$, $M_5$ and O K edges. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum of Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$ at the Ir $L_3$ edge possesses sharp twelve features below 1.5 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitations located from 2 to 4 eV are due to $t_{2g} \to e_g$ and $O_{2p} \to t_{2g}$ transitions. The high energy peaks situated at 5-11 eV appear due to charge transfer transitions. The theory reproduces well the shape and polarization dependence of the oxygen O K RIXS spectrum. We have found that the dependence of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge on the incident photon energy and the momentum transfer vector Q is much stronger than the corresponding dependence at the Ir $L_3$ edge</description>

      <title>Optical engineering and detection of magnetism in moir\'e semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for optically inducing, controlling, and probing spin states in moir\'e systems. In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moir\'e bilayers. Furthermore, we establish direct connections between the resulting spin correlations and experimentally observable optical signals. Our work paves the way for future studies on the optical control and detection on strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>1/5 and 1/3 magnetization plateaux in the spin 1/2 chain system YbAlO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a small, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a weak phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Chiral order emergence driven by quenched disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorder is expected to destroy order, such as when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional magnetic system. Even when order exists in the presence of disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order, driven by quenched disorder, emerges, that has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. It's a new type of order by disorder that differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical Heisenberg model on the $J_1-J_3$ kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with magnetic site vacancies. After analyzing the effect of a few impurities on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the clean system.</description>
