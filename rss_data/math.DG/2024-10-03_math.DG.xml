      <title>On bounds of entropy and total curvature for ancient curve shortening flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounds of total curvature and entropy are two common conditions placed on mean curvature flows. We show that these two hypotheses are equivalent for the class of ancient complete embedded smooth planar curve shortening flows, which are one-dimensional mean curvature flows. As an application, we give a short proof of the uniqueness of tangent flow at infinity of an ancient smooth complete non-compact curve shortening flow with finite entropy embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Conformal and holomorphic barycenters in hyperbolic balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of \textit{conformal barycenter} and \textit{holomorphic barycenter} of a measurable set $D$ in the hyperbolic ball. The two barycenters coincide in the disk, but they differ in multidimensional balls $\mathbb{C}^m \cong \mathbb{R}^{2m}$. These notions are counterparts of barycenters of measures on spheres, introduced by Douady and Earle in 1986.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of differentiable stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morita equivalence classes of Lie groupoids serve as models for differentiable stacks, which are higher spaces in differential geometry, generalizing manifolds and orbifolds. Representations up to homotopy of Lie groupoids provide a higher analog of classical representations and play a significant role in Poisson geometry. In this paper, we prove that the cohomology with coefficients in a representation up to homotopy is a Morita invariant, and therefore an invariant of the underlying stack. This result was inspired by the 2-term case, previously developed by del Hoyo and Ortiz, and it relies on the simplicial approach to representations up to homotopy, recently introduced by del Hoyo and Trentinaglia. As a subsidiary result, we include a proof of the cohomological descent for higher Lie groupoids.</description>

      <title>Index, Intersections, and Multiplicity of Min-Max Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds for the Morse index and number of intersections of min-max geodesics achieving the $p$-widths of a closed surface. A key tool in our analysis is a proof that for a generic set of metrics, the tangent cone at any vertex of any finite union of closed immersed geodesics consists of exactly two lines.
  We also construct examples to demonstrate that multiplicity one does not hold generically in this setting. Specifically, we construct an open set of metrics on $S^2$ for which the $p$-width is only achieved by $p$ copies of a single geodesic.</description>

      <title>Liouville's theorem in calibrated geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following extension of the classical Liouville theorem: A calibration $\omega \in \Lambda^n \mathbb{R}^m$, where $3 \le n \le m$, has the Liouville property if a Sobolev mapping $F\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a domain, in $W^{1,n}_{loc}( \Omega, \mathbb{R}^m )$ satisfying $\|DF\|^n = \star F^{*}\omega$ almost everywhere is a restriction of a M\"obius transformation $\mathbb{S}^m \to \mathbb{S}^m$.
  We show that, for $m\ge 5$, every calibration in $\Lambda^{m-2} \mathbb{R}^m$ has the Liouville property and, in low dimensions, a calibration $\omega \in \Lambda^n \mathbb{R}^m$ has the Liouville property for $3 \le n \le m \le 6$ unless $\omega$ is face equivalent to the Special Lagrangian. In these cases, the Liouville property stems from isoperimetric rigidity of these mappings together with a classification of calibrations whose conformally flat calibrated submanifolds are flat.
  We also show that, for $3 \leq n \leq m$, the calibrations with the Liouville property form a dense $G_\delta$ set in the space of calibrations. As an application, we consider factorization of more general quasiregular curves and stability of quasiregular curves of small distortion.</description>

      <title>Weak quasi contact metric manifolds and new characteristics of K-contact and Sasakian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi contact metric manifolds (introduced by Y. Tashiro and then studied by several authors) are a natural extension of the contact metric manifolds. Weak almost contact metric manifolds, i.e., the linear complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, were defined by the author and R. Wolak. In this paper, we study a weak analogue of quasi contact metric manifolds. Our main results generalize some well known theorems and provide new criterions for K-contact and Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an exotic 7-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, one of Milnor's exotic $7$-spheres. We focus on a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz, with a round $S^4$ as base space, unit $S^3$ as fibre, and $k=1,2$ $SU(2)$ instantons as gauge fields, where all quantities admit an elegant description in quaternionic language. The metric's moduli space coincides with the $k=1,2$ instantons' moduli space quotiented by the isometry of the base, plus an additional $\mathbb{R}^+$ factor corresponding to the radius of the base, $r$. We identify a "center" of the $k=2$ instanton moduli space with enhanced symmetry. This $k=2$ solution is used together with the maximally symmetric $k=1$ solution to obtain a metric of maximal isometry, $SO(3)\times O(2)$, and to compute its Ricci tensor explicitly. This allows us to put a bound on $r$ to ensure positive Ricci curvature, which implies various energy conditions for an $8$-dimensional static space-time. The construction opens for a concrete examination of the properties of the sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Score-based pullback Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Riemannian geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for interpretable representation learning, offering improved efficiency in downstream tasks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only produces high-quality geodesics through the data support, but also reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold and provides a global chart of the manifold, even in high-dimensional ambient spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Innovative Dynamics: Utilizing Perelman's Entropy and Ricci Flow for Settler Position Models on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to modeling the positional dynamics of stars using discrete dynamical systems. We define star evolution through discrete-time update rules based on right ascension, declination, and distance, incorporating chaotic behavior via nonlinear functions and external perturbations. By applying Ricci flow and Riemannian metrics, we provide new insights into the positional dynamics of stars. Theoretical computations of Perelman entropy are used to assess system complexity, with high-precision Runge-Kutta methods ensuring accurate solutions for our chaotic model. We quantify chaos using Lyapunov exponents and perform bifurcation analysis to study how parameter variations affect the dynamics. Comparing our model to the Lorenz attractor reveals both similarities and unique characteristics in stellar dynamics. Our results show that entropy increases exponentially, indicating that predicting star positions with precision becomes increasingly challenging over time. This study advances the understanding of chaos in celestial systems and contributes to dynamical systems theory by integrating chaos theory with astronomical modeling.</description>

      <title>Convexity and rigidity of hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, closed infinitesimally convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ bound convex flat regions, if curvature of $M^n$ vanishes on tangent planes of $\Gamma$. This encompasses Chern-Lashof-Sacksteder characterization of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and some results of Greene-Wu-Gromov on rigidity of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. It follows that closed simply connected surfaces in $M^3$ with minimal total absolute curvature bound Euclidean convex bodies, as stated by M. Gromov in 1985. The proofs employ the Gauss-Codazzi equations, a generalization of Schur comparison theorem to CAT($k$) spaces, and other techniques from Alexandrov geometry outlined by A. Petrunin.</description>

Abstract: The notion of a generalized product, refining that of a (symmetric and smooth) simplicial space is introduced and shown to imply the existence of an algebra of pseudodifferential operators. This encompasses many constructions of such algebras on manifolds with corners. The main examples discussed in detail here are related to the semiclassical (and adiabatic) calculus as used in the approach to a twisted form of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem in work with Is Singer and Mathai Varghese.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove some Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. In particular, we give a sharp Willmore-like inequality in shrinking gradient Ricci solitons. We also characterize the equality cases of our Willmore-type inequalities. These results can be regarded as generalizations of Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri's Willmore-type inequality to weighted manifolds. As applications, we derive some isoperimetric type inequalities under certain existence assumptions of isoperimetric regions in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>Killing Fields on Compact m-Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that given a compact, connected $m$-quasi Einstein manifold $(M,g,X)$ without boundary, the potential vector field $X$ is Killing if and only if $(M, g)$ has constant scalar curvature. This extends a result of Bahuaud-Gunasekaran-Kunduri-Woolgar, where it is shown that $X$ is Killing if $X$ is incompressible. We also provide a sufficient condition for a compact, non-gradient $m$-quasi Einstein metric to admit a Killing field. We do this by following a technique of Dunajski and Lucietti, who prove that a Killing field always exists in this case when $m=2$. This condition provides an alternate proof of the aforementioned result of Bahuaud-Gunasekaran-Kunduri-Woolgar. This alternate proof works in the $m = -2$ case as well, which was not covered in the original proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce higher analogs for cleavages and flatness within the context of (Kan) simplicial fibrations, and apply them to provide geometric models for Lie groupoid representations up to homotopy. Concretely, we establish a functorial equivalence between representations up to homotopy of a Lie groupoid and simplicial vector bundles over its nerve endowed with a cleavage. Our result extends earlier work of Gracia-Saz and Mehta, it can be seen as a relative version of the Dold-Kan correspondence, and also as a higher smooth generalization of the Grothendieck correspondence between pseudo-functors and fibered categories.</description>

Abstract: Cohesive module provides a tool to study coherent sheaves on complex manifolds by global analytic methods. In this paper we develop the theory of residue currents for cohesive modules on complex manifolds. In particular we prove that they have the duality principle and satisfy the comparison formula. As an application, we prove a generalized version of the Poincar\'{e}-Lelong formula for cohesive modules, which applies to coherent sheaves without globally defined locally free resolutions.</description>
