      <title>GeoGraph: Geometric and Graph-based Ensemble Descriptors for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized the prediction of rigid protein structures, modelling the conformational ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) remains a key frontier. Current AI paradigms present a trade-off: Protein Language Models (PLMs) capture evolutionary statistics but lack explicit physical grounding, while generative models trained to model full ensembles are computationally expensive. In this work we critically assess these limits and propose a path forward. We introduce GeoGraph, a simulation-informed surrogate trained to predict ensemble-averaged statistics of residue-residue contact-map topology directly from sequence. By featurizing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations into residue- and sequence-level graph descriptors, we create a robust and information-rich learning target. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields representations that are more predictive of key biophysical properties than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Integrative modelling of biomolecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of our mechanistic understanding of the functions of biological macromolecules is based on static structural experiments, which can be modelled either as single structures or conformational ensembles. While these provide us with invaluable insights, they do not directly reveal that molecules are inherently dynamic. Advances in time-dependent and time-resolved experimental methods have made it possible to capture the dynamics of biomolecules at increasingly higher spatial and temporal resolutions. To complement these, computational models can represent the structural and dynamical behaviour of biomolecules at atomistic resolution and femtosecond timescale, and are therefore useful to interpret these experiments. Here, we review the progress in integrating simulations with dynamical experiments, focusing on the combination of simulations with time-resolved and time-dependent experimental data.</description>

      <title>Learning Inter-Atomic Potentials without Explicit Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.</description>

      <title>Flow Autoencoders are Effective Protein Tokenizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures. Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention. We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.</description>

      <title>AReUReDi: Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows with Multi-Objective Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.</description>
