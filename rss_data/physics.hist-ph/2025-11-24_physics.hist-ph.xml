      <title>The 59th Karl Jansky Lecture: Discovering the Radio Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NRAO 59th Karl Jansky Lecture was presented on 24 October 2024, 22 November 2024, and 4 December 2024 in Charlottesville, Virginia, Socorro, New Mexico, and Green Bank, West Virginia, respectively. The lecture covered the circumstances of the author's start in radio astronomy, the demographics of radio astronomers, discussions of the outstanding, mostly serendipitous, discoveries made by radio astronomers over the past century, and concluded with reflections on the prospects for further new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Mathematics: the Rise of the Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue how AI can assist mathematics in three ways: theorem-proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and theoretical physics in 2017, we summarize how this emerging field has grown over the past years, and show how various machine-learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines in the mathematical sciences. At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. The activity engaged students in collaborative exploration using a "black box" as an analogical model of the atom. Grounded in constructivist theory and the Focus Action-Reflection (FAR) model to introduce analogies in the in-class context, we explore how analogical reasoning can support high school students in understanding the atomic structure. Data from student worksheets, graphical representations, and group discussions were analyzed using thematic, phenomenographic, and conceptual metaphor analysis. Results indicate that students were able to develop and refine analogical models, reason from empirical evidence, and engage in critical reflection on the epistemological limits of the analogy. While students demonstrated conceptual gains and collaborative problem-solving, the analysis also revealed persistent risks of reifying metaphors or overextending macroscopic analogies to quantum domains. These findings highlight the value - and limitations - of structured analogical modeling in contemporary physics education, and point to the need for teacher training that fosters epistemological awareness and reflective use of models in the classroom.</description>
