      <title>Some new results for the GHWS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states. We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting with minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter and an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channels describe subsystem or open system evolution. Using the classical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, 4 classical Koopman channels are identified that are analogs of the 4 possible quantum channels in a bipartite setting. Thus when the complete evolution has a quantum-classical correspondence the correspondence at the level of the subunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum can be interpreted as noisy single particle systems. Having parallel classical and quantum operators gives us new access to study fine details of these major limiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we contrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channel. The largest nontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the stable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly small in relation to the scale of an effective $\hbar$. In the case when the dynamics has a significant fraction of chaos the spectrum has a prominent annular density that is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of random matrix theory, and the ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is approached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit seem to be either scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of networks with weak geometric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Renormalization Group is crucial for understanding systems across scales, including complex networks. Renormalizing networks via network geometry, a framework in which their topology is based on the location of nodes in a hidden metric space, is one of the foundational approaches. However, the current methods assume that the geometric coupling is strong, neglecting weak coupling in many real networks. This paper extends renormalization to weak geometric coupling, showing that geometric information is essential to preserve self-similarity. Our results underline the importance of geometric effects on network topology even when the coupling to the underlying space is weak.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>
