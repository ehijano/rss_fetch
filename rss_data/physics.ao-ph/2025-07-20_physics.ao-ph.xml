      <title>Impact of Forecast Stability on Navigational Contrail Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating contrail-induced warming by re-routing flights around contrail-forming regions requires accurate and stable forecasts of the state of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Forecast stability (i.e., consistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly important for "pre-tactical" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes based on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to date has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability limits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this gap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather forecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors shows low pointwise consistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and reanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous comparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we also show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are relatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when reanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing a trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors allows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce contrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24 hour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under 0.4%. Our results show that forecasts with lead times relevant to flight planning are stable enough to be used for pre-tactical contrail avoidance.</description>

      <title>VA-MoE: Variables-Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Incremental Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Variables Adaptive Mixture of Experts (VAMoE), a novel framework for incremental weather forecasting that dynamically adapts to evolving spatiotemporal patterns in real time data. Traditional weather prediction models often struggle with exorbitant computational expenditure and the need to continuously update forecasts as new observations arrive. VAMoE addresses these challenges by leveraging a hybrid architecture of experts, where each expert specializes in capturing distinct subpatterns of atmospheric variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed). Moreover, the proposed method employs a variable adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically select and combine relevant experts based on the input context, enabling efficient knowledge distillation and parameter sharing. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high forecast accuracy. Experiments on real world ERA5 dataset demonstrate that VAMoE performs comparable against SoTA models in both short term (1 days) and long term (5 days) forecasting tasks, with only about 25% of trainable parameters and 50% of the initial training data.</description>

      <title>Lightning activity on a tidally locked terrestrial exoplanet in storm-resolving simulations for a range of surface pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloudy atmospheres produce electric discharges, including lightning. Lightning, in turn, provides sufficient energy to break down air molecules into reactive species and thereby affects the atmospheric composition. The climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and highly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on their day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing convective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one is atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global storm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally locked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning parameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the vertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations predict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface pressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial distribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface pressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the vertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised, high-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>FourCastNet 3: A geometric approach to probabilistic machine-learning weather forecasting at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable, geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting. The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3 delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8 to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches, FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on 1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model- and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a single GPU, producing a 60-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly resolution in under 4 minutes. Its computational efficiency, medium-range probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.</description>
