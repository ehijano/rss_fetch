      <title>Nuclear responses with neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo framework that combines neural-network quantum states with the Lorentz integral transform technique to compute the dynamical properties of self-bound quantum many-body systems in continuous Hilbert spaces. While broadly applicable to various quantum systems, including atoms and molecules, in this initial application we focus on the photoabsorption cross section of light nuclei, where benchmarks against numerically exact techniques are available. Our accurate theoretical predictions are complemented by robust uncertainty quantification, enabling meaningful comparisons with experiments. We demonstrate that a simple nuclear Hamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion and known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with $A\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption cross section.</description>

      <title>Application of the Holographic Equation of State for Numerical Modeling of the Evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Model's free parameters are calibrated using lattice results for quark masses approximating physical values and adjusted to match the Regge spectra of $\rho$ mesons. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which incorporates the MUSIC relativistic hydrodynamics solver. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD approach at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the properties of $1^-_1$ excited states of even-even nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commissioning of new sources of monochromatic $\gamma$-quanta will allow obtaining a large amount of new data on low-lying collective states of negative parity of even-even nuclei. The purpose of this work is to derive relations between observables characterizing the low-energy negative parity states in even-even nuclei and to investigate the dependence of E2 transitions between the low-energy collective states in these nuclei on the parity of states. The Hamiltonian of the Collective Model and the fermionic Q-phonon representation of the vectors of collective states are used. Relations between different E1 transition matrix elements are derived and the parity dependence of E2 transitions is investigated. Relations between the observables characterizing the low-lying collective states of both parities in even-even nuclei are obtained, which can be verified using experimental data produced by facilities generating intense monochromatic beams of $\gamma$-quanta.</description>

      <title>A nuclear mass model rooted in chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a nuclear mass model that is based on chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to leading order. Nuclear binding energies are computed via the Hartree-Fock method using a Hamiltonian from delta-full chiral effective field theory. We employ Hartree-Fock emulators to adjust $11$ low-energy constants in the chiral interaction to binding energies of $18$ even-even nuclei. When applied to $107$ even-even nuclei with mass numbers $16\leq A\leq 56$ the chiral mass model exhibits an overall root-mean-square deviation of $3.5$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Can 1957 cold-fusion explain 1989 cold-fusion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion at ambient temperature takes place in deuterated metals is analyzed theoretically. It is suggested that the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt) fusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD crystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium diffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the rate of (d$\mu$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the possibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point to an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the probability of $\mu^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be evaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we advance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered by cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special conditions, a mW power per $\mu^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent experimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in out-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation. However, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically, and an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify or invalidate this idea.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>Solitons and singularities in relativistic ultrastiff fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical duality exists between massless scalar fields and relativistic fluids governed by an ultrastiff equation of state, in which the pressure equals the mass-energy density, and the sound speed equals $c$. This duality entails that certain solutions of the wave equation (a linear theory) can be mapped to solutions of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics (an inherently nonlinear theory). Leveraging this correspondence, we explore some interesting properties of ultrastiff fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate that all nonlinear sound waves in such media are solitons. Moreover, we prove that, in 3+1 dimensions, compactly supported configurations of an ultrastiff fluid inevitably evolve, in finite time, toward a singular state where the fluid's flow velocity exits the future lightcone. We also demonstrate that, prior to the formation of this singularity, first-order perturbation theory in the small parameter $c_s^{-2}-c^{-2}$ produces divergent results. As a consequence, a fluid whose speed of sound is, say, $0.995 c$ exhibits markedly different behavior near the singularity compared to a fluid with a speed of sound exactly equal to $c$.</description>

      <title>Timelike form factor for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The form factor $F_\3pi(s,t,u)$ for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$ is calculated in the isospin limit for several values of the light current-quark mass (i.e., the pion mass) using Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Beyond a quark interaction kernel representing gluon-mediated interactions, leading beyond-rainbow-ladder effects at low energies are incorporated by back-coupling pions as explicit degrees of freedom. Building upon an earlier calculation of the quark-photon vertex that captures the branch cut associated with the two-pion threshold and the rho meson resonance, the form factor $F_\3pi(s,t,u)$ is determined for timelike Mandelstam s. In particular, predictions are made for the kinematics relevant for the Primakoff reaction studied with COMPASS/AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and nonzero baryon chemical potential. In this article, we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of hardon resonance gas models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458</link>

Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>The moat regimes within $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better understand recent predictions on the moat regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter, this paper extends the previous work within the two-flavor Quark-Meson (QM) model to the more realistic $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson (PQM) model. Mainly, two effects are further taken into account: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model parameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudo-critical temperature from lattice QCD, $T_{\rm C}\sim 156~ {\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical potential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\mu_{\rm B(CEP)}\sim 635~ {\rm MeV}$. It is found that the basic features of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons remain similar to those from QM model: Moat regimes cover the region where temperature or baryon chemical potential is large; reentrances occur around the critical baryon chemical potential of chiral transition at zero temperature. Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\mu_{\rm B}$ plane. The moat regime and pole energy of $K$ mesons are also studied with the features similar.</description>
