      <title>Impact of metallographic polishing on the RF properties of Niobium for SRF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities made of Niobium is tied to the quality of their inner surfaces exposed to the radio frequency (RF) waves. Future superconducting particle accelerators, because of their dimensions or the unprecedented stringent technical requirements, require the development of innovative surface processing techniques to improve processing reliability and if possible ecological footprint and cost, compared to conventional chemical processes. Metallographic polishing (MP) has emerged as a promising polishing technology to address these challenges. Previous studies focused on the characterization of the processed material surface at room temperature in the absence of RF waves. However, the evaluation of material properties, such as surface resistance under RF, at cryogenic temperature has failed, primarily due to the unavailability of devices capable of achieving the necessary resolution in the nanohm range. To overcome this limitation, a quadrupole resonator (QPR) has been utilized. The RF results demonstrate that the MP polishing, developed to preserve a high-quality niobium surface with very low surface resistance, is highly effective compared to conventional polishing. This conclusion is further supported by topography and microstructural analysis of the QPR top-hat samples, which revealed the clear superiority of the metallographic approach.</description>

      <title>SASE X-ray Free-Electron Laser driven by Resonant Multi-Pulse Ionization acceleration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield accelerators are on the way to provide GeV scale high-brightness electron beams for multidisciplinary applications. In the present work, electron bunches are studied in the framework of a Free-Electron Laser driven by an accelerator in the Resonant Multi-Pulse Ionisation framework. The transport to the undulator is provided by a matched beam focusing with marginal beam quality degradation. Finally, using the CRESCO/ENEAGRID High Performance Computing infrastructure, 3D time-dependent simulations of the produced radiation show that about 10$^{10}$ photons with central wavelength of 0.15 nm will be delivered with the electron bunches under consideration.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Multi-Stage Physics Experiments at a Large-Scale User Facility Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first language-model-driven agentic artificial intelligence (AI) system to autonomously execute multi-stage physics experiments on a production synchrotron light source. Implemented at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator, the system translates natural language user prompts into structured execution plans that combine archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, automated script generation, controlled machine interaction, and analysis. In a representative machine physics task, we show that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual scripting even for a system expert, while operator-standard safety constraints were strictly upheld. Core architectural features, plan-first orchestration, bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent, auditable execution with fully reproducible artifacts. These results establish a blueprint for the safe integration of agentic AI into accelerator experiments and demanding machine physics studies, as well as routine operations, with direct portability across accelerators worldwide and, more broadly, to other large-scale scientific infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Low-beta Nb$_3$Sn Cavity for ATLAS and Future Ion Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a Nb$_3$Sn-coated low-beta superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity intended for accelerating ions. We aim to apply the cavity in ATLAS, our Argonne National Laboratory user facility for nuclear physics studies with ion beams in the energy range of 5-20 MeV/u. The Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, a 145 MHz quarter-wave optimized for ions moving with velocity $\beta$=v/c=0.08 exhibits an order-of-magnitude reduction in radiofrequency (RF) losses into helium at $4.4\,\mathrm{K}$ compared to a superconducting niobium (Nb) cavity at the same frequency and temperature. Experimentally measured fields are among the highest to date for any Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, reaching to the peak surface magnetic field of 105 mT. We also present a practical solution to the problem of cavity frequency tuning. Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb$_3$Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics. The same Nb$_3$Sn cavity technology offers broad benefits for future ion accelerators.</description>

      <title>Integration and commissioning plan of Full Flow Purifier at Muon Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas. Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the 3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption capacity over time.</description>
