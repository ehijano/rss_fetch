      <title>Synthetic High-resolution Cryo-EM Density Maps with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating synthetic cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D density maps from molecular structures has potential important applications in structural biology. Yet existing simulation-based methods cannot mimic all the complex features present in experimental maps, such as secondary structure elements. As an alternative, we propose struc2mapGAN, a novel data-driven method that employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce high-resolution experimental-like density maps from molecular structures. More specifically, struc2mapGAN uses a U-Net++ architecture as the generator, with an additional L1 loss term and further processing of raw experimental maps to enhance learning efficiency. While struc2mapGAN can promptly generate maps after training, we demonstrate that it outperforms existing simulation-based methods for a wide array of tested maps and across various evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenwei-zhang/struc2mapGAN.</description>

      <title>Experimental Data Confirm Carrier-Cascade Model for Solid-State Conductance across Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finding that electronic conductance across ultra-thin protein films between metallic electrodes remains nearly constant from room temperature to just a few degrees Kelvin has posed a challenge. We show that a model based on a generalized Landauer formula explains the nearly constant conductance and predicts an Arrhenius-like dependence for low temperatures. A critical aspect of the model is that the relevant activation energy for conductance is either the difference between the HOMO and HOMO-1 or the LUMO+1 and LUMO energies instead of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the proteins. Analysis of experimental data confirm the Arrhenius-like law and allows us to extract the activation energies. We then calculate the energy differences with advanced DFT methods for proteins used in the experiments. Our main result is that the experimental and theoretical activation energies for these three different proteins and three differently prepared solid-state junctions match nearly perfectly, implying the mechanism's validity.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>
