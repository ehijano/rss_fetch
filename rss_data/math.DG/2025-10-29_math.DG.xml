      <title>On the geometry of profinite diffeological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of profinite diffeological spaces, that is, diffeological spaces which diffeologies are deduced by pull-back of diffeologies on finite-dimensional manifolds through a system of projection mappings. This class includes inductive limits of finite-dimensional manifolds, as well as solution spaces of differential relations and spaces that agree with cylindrical approximations. We analyze tangent and cotangent spaces, differential forms, Riemannian metrics, connections, differential operators, Laplacians, symplectic forms, momentum maps and the relation between de Rham and singular cohomology on them, unifying constructions partially developed in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Discrete minimal surfaces: Old and New</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey structure-preserving discretizations of minimal surfaces in Euclidean space. Our focus is on a discretization defined via parallel face offsets of polyhedral surfaces, which naturally leads to a notion of vanishing mean curvature and a corresponding variational characterization. All simply connected discrete minimal surfaces of this type can be constructed from circle patterns via a discrete Weierstrass representation formula. This representation links the space of discrete minimal surfaces to the deformation space of circle patterns, and thereby to classical Teichm\"uller theory. We also discuss variants of discrete minimal surfaces obtained by modifying the definition of mean curvature, restricting the variational criterion, or replacing circle pattern data with discrete conformal equivalence, Koebe-type circle packings, or quadrilateral meshes with factorized cross ratios. We conclude with open questions on discrete minimal surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the Hopf differentials and the curvature line flows on time-like constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces in Lorentzian 3-space forms. In particular, when the Hopf differential is non-degenerate, the index of a curvature line flow at an umbilic point depends precisely on the remainder of its order modulo four.</description>

      <title>Mollifier smoothing of left-invariant strongly convex $C^0$-Finsler structures on Lie groups and convergence of extremals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $TM$ its tangent bundle. A $C^0$-Finsler structure of $M$ is a continuous function $F:TM \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $F$ restricted to each tangent space $T_xM$ of $M$ is an asymmetric norm. $F$ is strongly convex if $F\vert_{T_xM}$ is a strongly convex asymmetric norm for every $x \in M$. Let $G$ be a Lie group endowed with a left-invariant strongly convex $C^0$-Finsler structure $F$.
  We introduce a smoothing $F_{\varepsilon}$ of $F$, which is a left-invariant version of the mollifier smoothing presented previously by the same authors.
  We study extremals $x(t)$ on $(G,F)$ using the Pontryagin maximum principle.
  Given $(x_0,\alpha_0)$ in the cotangent bundle $T^\ast G$ of $G$, we prove that there exist a unique Pontryagin extremal $t\in \mathbb{R} \mapsto (x(t), \alpha(t))$ such that $(x(0),\alpha(0))=(x_0,\alpha_0)$.
  Moreover, if $t \in \mathbb{R} \mapsto (x_\varepsilon(t), \alpha_{\varepsilon}(t))$ is the unique Pontryagin extremal on $(G,F_\varepsilon)$ such that $(x_\varepsilon(0), \alpha_{\varepsilon}(0))=(x_0, \alpha_0)$, then we prove that $(x_{\varepsilon}(t),\alpha_\varepsilon(t))$ converges uniformly to $(x(t),\alpha(t))$ on compact intervals of $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic Lie system on a manifold $M$ is a stochastic differential equation whose dynamics is described by a linear combination with functions depending on $\mathbb{R}^\ell$-valued semi-martigales of vector fields on $M$ spanning a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. We analyse new examples of stochastic Lie systems and Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems, and review and extend the coalgebra method for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. We apply the theory to biological and epidemiological models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Riccati equations, coronavirus models, stochastic Ermakov systems, etc.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Geometric Deformations of Function Algebras on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for deforming the algebra of smooth functions on a compact Riemannian manifold based on spectral data rather than group actions or Poisson structures. The deformation is defined through spectral coefficients of the Laplacian and a weight function satisfying a fusion-type cocycle condition, producing a noncommutative product that depends intrinsically on Laplacian spectrum of the manifold. We develop the analytic and algebraic foundations of this construction, establishing associativity, continuity, and the existence of a group structure on admissible weights. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to spectrum-preserving maps of manifolds. This spectral-geometric deformation quantization approach provides a fully intrinsic analytic model of noncommutative geometry based solely on spectral data of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves in Euclidean space equipped with discrete Sobolev-type metrics. It has been established that these spaces of discrete regular curves are geodesically complete if and only if the Sobolev-type metric is of order two or higher. By relying on a general result by Grigor'yan and controlling the volume growth of geodesic balls, we show that all spaces of discrete regular curves that are geodesically complete are also stochastically complete, that is, the associated Brownian motion exists for all times. This provides a rigorous footing for performing data statistics, such as data inference and data imputation, on these spaces. Our result is the first stochastic completeness result in shape analysis that applies to the full shape space of interest. For illustrative purposes, we include simulations for sample paths of Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves. For the space of triangles in the plane modulo rotation, translation and scaling, we further provide heuristics which suggest that this space remains stochastically complete even for Sobolev-type metrics of order zero and one.</description>

      <title>Integral-Einstein hypersurfaces in spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.03753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, we generalize Einstein manifolds to Integral-Einstein (IE) submanifolds. A Takahashi-type theorem is established to characterize minimal hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature (CSC) in unit spheres which are conjectured to be isoparametric in the Chern conjecture. For these hypersurfaces, we obtain some integral inequalities with the bounds characterizing exactly the totally geodesic hypersphere, the non-IE minimal Clifford torus $S^{1}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}})\times S^{n-1}(\sqrt{\frac{n-1}{n}})$ and the IE minimal CSC hypersurfaces. Moreover, if further the third mean curvature is constant, then it is an IE hypersurface or an isoparametric hypersurface with $g\leq2$ principal curvatures. In particular, all minimal isoparametric hypersurfaces with $g\geq3$ principal curvatures are IE hypersurfaces. As applications, we obtain some spherical Bernstein theorems, including that any embedded closed minimal surface of genus no more than $\mathfrak{g}$ inside a tubular neighborhood of constant radius $r(\mathfrak{g})&gt;0$ around an equator in $\mathbb{S}^3$ is an equator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Bryant's research on austere subspaces and Cartan's isoparametric hypersurfaces with 3 distinct principal curvatures, we construct three families of austere submanifolds with flat normal bundle in unit spheres. From these examples we find three irreducible proper Dupin hypersurfaces with 5 distinct principal curvatures of different multiplicities. Thus, we give a negative answer to an open question raised by Thorbergsson in 2000 which is instructive for the local classification of proper Dupin hypersurfaces. Moreover, as an application, we obtain an upper bound estimate for the dimension of austere subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g)$ whose curvature operator of the second kind $\mathring{R}$ satisfies the condition \begin{equation*} \alpha^{-1} (\lambda_1 +\cdots +\lambda_{\alpha}) &gt; - \theta \bar{\lambda}, \end{equation*} where $\lambda_1 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_{(n-1)(n+2)/2}$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathring{R}$, $\bar{\lambda}$ is their average, and $\theta &gt; -1$. Under such conditions with optimal $\theta$ depending on $n$ and $\alpha$, we prove two differentiable sphere theorems in dimensions three and four, a homological sphere theorem in higher dimensions, and a curvature characterization of K\"ahler space forms. These results generalize recent works corresponding to $\theta =0$ of Cao-Gursky-Tran, Nienhaus-Petersen-Wink, and the author. Moreover, examples are provided to demonstrate the sharpness of all results.</description>

Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the dimension of the linear space of holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on gradient K\"ahler Ricci shrinkers with bounded curvature. The upper bound is given as a power function of the growth rate. Similar results hold for holomorphic $(p, 0)-$forms, and holomorphic sections of the pluri-anticanonical line bundle $K_M^{-q}$. We also prove the existence of holomorphic sections of $K_M^{-q}$ with polynomial growth when the K\"ahler Ricci shrinker is asymptotically conical, provided $q$ is sufficiently large; as an application, we show that the Kodaira map constructed using such sections is a holomorphic embbedding into a complex projective space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential geometric properties of lightcone framed surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In general, a mixed type surface is a connected regular surface with non-empty spacelike and timelike point sets. While a lightcone framed surface is a mixed type surface with singular points at least locally. We introduce a useful tool, so called modified frame along the lightcone framed surface, to study the differential geometric properties of the lightcone framed surface. As results, we show the behavior of the Gaussian curvature and mean curvature of the lightcone framed surface at not only lightlike points but also singular points.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a compact Hermitian surface is K\"ahler under certain non-positivity or non-negativity conditions on Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures. The key tools for achieve these results are new Ricci curvature and Chern number identities for the Strominger-Bismut connection. This work complements and extends earlier results of Yang.</description>

      <title>Quantization of K\"ahler Manifolds via Brane Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their physical proposal for quantization [20], Gukov-Witten suggested that, given a symplectic manifold $M$ with a complexification $X$, the A-model morphism spaces $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ should recover holomorphic deformation quantization of $X$ and geometric quantization of $M$ respectively, where $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}$ is a canonical coisotropic A-brane on $X$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is a Lagrangian A-brane supported on $M$.
  Assuming $M$ is spin and K\"ahler with a prequantum line bundle $L$, Chan-Leung-Li [10] constructed a subsheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$ of smooth functions on $M$ with a non-formal star product and a left $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-module structure on the sheaf of holomorphic sections of $L^{\otimes k} \otimes \sqrt{K}$.
  In this paper, we give a careful treatment of the relation between (holomorphic) deformation quantizations of $M$ and $X$. As a result, Chan-Leung-Li's work [10] provides a mathematical realization of the action of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$. By Fedosov's gluing arguments, we also construct a $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-$\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-bimodule structure on the sheaf of smooth sections of $L^{\otimes 2k}$ to realize the actions of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$, which is related to the analytic geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. This paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a computable iterative procedure for lifting an atlas to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity, applicable to any $L^p$ affine connection defined in a $W^{2,p}$ starting atlas, $p&gt;n$. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally, $p&gt;n$. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients) in General Relativity. The essential regularity is the point where an intrinsic level regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <title>Mountain Pass Critical Points of the Volume Constrained Area Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct mountain pass critical points of the perimeter functional on sets of fixed volume. For a generic metric, this gives rise to a smooth almost embedded hypersurface with non-zero constant mean curvature. Our work utilizes recent techniques of Mazurwoski--Zhou \cite{mazurowski2024infinitely}, and a new result on the connectedness of Cacciopoli sets: any two smooth Cacciopoli sets can be connected by an $\mathbf{F}$-continuous map.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet eigenvalue problems for some concave elliptic Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue. Finally, a bifurcation-type theory for these operators is also established.</description>
