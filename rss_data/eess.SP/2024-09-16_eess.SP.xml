      <title>Noisy Low Rank Column-wise Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the AltGDmin algorithm for solving the noisy low rank column-wise sensing (LRCS) problem. Our sample complexity guarantee improves upon the best existing one by a factor $\max(r, \log(1/\epsilon))/r$ where $r$ is the rank of the unknown matrix and $\epsilon$ is the final desired accuracy. A second contribution of this work is a detailed comparison of guarantees from all work that studies the exact same mathematical problem as LRCS, but refers to it by different names.</description>

      <title>SIMRP: Self-Interference Mitigation Using RIS and Phase Shifter Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong self-interference due to the co-located transmitter is the bottleneck for implementing an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) system. If not adequately mitigated, the strong interference can saturate the receiver's analog-digital converters (ADCs) and hence void the digital processing. This paper considers utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), together with a receiving (Rx) phase shifter network (PSN), to mitigate the strong self-interference through jointly optimizing their phases. This method, named self-interference mitigation using RIS and PSN (SIMRP), can suppress self-interference to avoid ADC saturation effectively and therefore improve the sum rate performance of communication systems, as verified by the simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Symbol-Level Precoding-Based Self-Interference Cancellation for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a base station (BS) employs a full-duplex radio to simultaneously serve multiple users and detect a target. The detection performance of the BS may be compromised by self-interference (SI) leakage. This paper investigates the feasibility of SI cancellation (SIC) through the application of symbol-level precoding (SLP). We first derive the target detection probability in the presence of the SI. We then formulate an SLP-based SIC problem, which optimizes the target detection probability while satisfying the quality of service requirements of all users. The formulated problem is a nonconvex fractional programming (FP) problem with a large number of equality and inequality constraints. We propose a penalty-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for solving the formulated problem, which allows for efficient closed-form updates of each block of variables at each iteration. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to showcase the enhanced detection performance of the proposed SIC approach.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity DoA-ToA Signature Estimation for Multi-Antenna Multi-Carrier Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate direction of arrival (DoA) and time of arrival (ToA) estimation is an stringent requirement for several wireless systems like sonar, radar, communications, and dual-function radar communication (DFRC). Due to the use of high carrier frequency and bandwidth, most of these systems are designed with multiple antennae and subcarriers. Although the resolution is high in the large array regime, the DoA-ToA estimation accuracy of the practical on-grid estimation methods still suffers from estimation inaccuracy due to the spectral leakage effect. In this article, we propose DoA-ToA estimation methods for multi-antenna multi-carrier systems with an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. In the first method, we apply discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based coarse signature estimation and propose a low complexity multistage fine-tuning for extreme enhancement in the estimation accuracy. The second method is based on compressed sensing, where we achieve the super-resolution by taking a 2D-overcomplete angle-delay dictionary than the actual number of antenna and subcarrier basis. Unlike the vectorized 1D-OMP method, we apply the low complexity 2D-OMP method on the matrix data model that makes the use of CS methods practical in the context of large array regimes. Through numerical simulations, we show that our proposed methods achieve the similar performance as that of the subspace-based 2D-MUSIC method with a significant reduction in computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Efficient FPGA Implementation of an Optimized SNN-based DFE for Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for higher data rates in communication systems intensifies the need for advanced non-linear equalizers capable of higher performance. Recently artificial neural networks (ANNs) were introduced as a viable candidate for advanced non-linear equalizers, as they outperform traditional methods. However, they are computationally complex and therefore power hungry. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) started to gain attention as an energy-efficient alternative to ANNs. Recent works proved that they can outperform ANNs at this task. In this work, we explore the design space of an SNN-based decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to reduce its computational complexity for an efficient implementation on field programmable gate array (FPGA). Our Results prove that it achieves higher communication performance than ANN-based DFE at roughly the same throughput and at 25X higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Restricted Isometry Property of Kronecker-structured Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the restricted isometry property (RIP) of Kronecker-structured matrices, formed by the Kronecker product of two factor matrices. Previously, only upper and lower bounds on the restricted isometry constant (RIC) in terms of the RICs of the factor matrices were known. We derive a probabilistic measurement bound for the $s$th-order RIC. We show that the Kronecker product of two sub-Gaussian matrices satisfies RIP with high probability if the minimum number of rows among two matrices is $\mathcal{O}(s \ln \max\{N_1, N_2\})$. Here, $s$ is the sparsity level, and $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of columns in the matrices. We also present improved measurement bounds for the recovery of Kronecker-structured sparse vectors using Kronecker-structured measurement matrices. Finally, our analysis is further extended to the Kronecker product of more than two matrices.</description>

      <title>Using Ear-EEG to Decode Auditory Attention in Multiple-speaker Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) can help to determine the identity of the attended speaker during an auditory selective attention task, by analyzing and processing measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Most studies on AAD are based on scalp-EEG signals in two-speaker scenarios, which are far from real application. Ear-EEG has recently gained significant attention due to its motion tolerance and invisibility during data acquisition, making it easy to incorporate with other devices for applications. In this work, participants selectively attended to one of the four spatially separated speakers' speech in an anechoic room. The EEG data were concurrently collected from a scalp-EEG system and an ear-EEG system (cEEGrids). Temporal response functions (TRFs) and stimulus reconstruction (SR) were utilized using ear-EEG data. Results showed that the attended speech TRFs were stronger than each unattended speech and decoding accuracy was 41.3\% in the 60s (chance level of 25\%). To further investigate the impact of electrode placement and quantity, SR was utilized in both scalp-EEG and ear-EEG, revealing that while the number of electrodes had a minor effect, their positioning had a significant influence on the decoding accuracy. One kind of auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) method, STAnet, was testified with this ear-EEG database, resulting in 93.1% in 1-second decoding window. The implementation code and database for our work are available on GitHub: https://github.com/zhl486/Ear_EEG_code.git and Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10803261.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The least squares (LS) estimate is the archetypical solution of linear regression problems. The asymptotic Gaussianity of the scaled LS error is often used to construct approximate confidence ellipsoids around the LS estimate, however, for finite samples these ellipsoids do not come with strict guarantees, unless some strong assumptions are made on the noise distributions. The paper studies the distribution-free Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm which can construct non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence ellipsoids under mild assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. These ellipsoids have the same center and orientation as the classical asymptotic ellipsoids, only their radii are different, which radii can be computed by convex optimization. Here, we establish high probability non-asymptotic upper bounds for the sizes of SPS outer ellipsoids for linear regression problems and show that the volumes of these ellipsoids decrease at the optimal rate. Finally, the difference between our theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of the regions are investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>RF Challenge: The Data-Driven Radio Frequency Signal Separation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a novel, data-driven approach that leverages state-of-the-art AI models. Traditionally, interference rejection algorithms are manually tailored to specific types of interference. This work introduces a more scalable data-driven solution and contains the following contributions. First, we present an insightful signal model that serves as a foundation for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. Second, we introduce the RF Challenge, a publicly available dataset featuring diverse RF signals along with code templates, which facilitates data-driven analysis of RF signal problems. Third, we propose novel AI-based rejection algorithms, specifically architectures like UNet and WaveNet, and evaluate their performance across eight different signal mixture types. These models demonstrate superior performance exceeding traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation by up to two orders of magnitude in bit-error rate. Fourth, we summarize the results from an open competition hosted at 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024) based on the RF Challenge, highlighting the significant potential for continued advancements in this area. Our findings underscore the promise of deep learning algorithms in mitigating interference, offering a strong foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Low-Complexity RSMA Scheme for Multi-User Decode-and-Forward Relay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a promising strategy for ensuring robust transmission in multi-antenna wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate the performance of RSMA in a downlink Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay scenario under two phases with imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter and the relay. In particular, in the first phase, the Base Station (BS) initially transmits to both BS Users (BUs) and the relay. In the second phase, the relay decodes and forwards the received signals to Relay Users (RUs) outside the BS coverage area. Furthermore, we investigate a scenario where the relay broadcasts a common stream intended for the RUs in the second phase. Due to the broadcast nature of the transmission, this stream is inadvertently received by both the RUs and the BUs. Concurrently, the BS utilizes Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) to transmit private streams to the BUs, resulting in BUs experiencing residual interference from the common stream transmitted from relay. Incorporating this residual common stream interference into our model results in a significant enhancement of the overall sum-rate achieved at the BUs. We derive a tractable lower bound on the ergodic sum-rates, enables us to develop closed-form solutions for power allocation that maximize the overall sum-rate in both phases. Extensive simulations validate that our proposed power allocation algorithm, in conjunction with a low-complexity precoder, significantly improves the sum-rate performance of DF relay RSMA networks compared to the SDMA-based benchmark designs under imperfect CSI at the transmitter and relay.</description>

      <title>Fast DCT+: A Family of Fast Transforms Based on Rank-One Updates of the Path Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops fast graph Fourier transform (GFT) algorithms with O(n log n) runtime complexity for rank-one updates of the path graph. We first show that several commonly-used audio and video coding transforms belong to this class of GFTs, which we denote by DCT+. Next, starting from an arbitrary generalized graph Laplacian and using rank-one perturbation theory, we provide a factorization for the GFT after perturbation. This factorization is our central result and reveals a progressive structure: we first apply the unperturbed Laplacian's GFT and then multiply the result by a Cauchy matrix. By specializing this decomposition to path graphs and exploiting the properties of Cauchy matrices, we show that Fast DCT+ algorithms exist. We also demonstrate that progressivity can speed up computations in applications involving multiple transforms related by rank-one perturbations (e.g., video coding) when combined with pruning strategies. Our results can be extended to other graphs and rank-k perturbations. Runtime analyses show that Fast DCT+ provides computational gains over the naive method for graph sizes larger than 64, with runtime approximately equal to that of 8 DCTs.</description>

      <title>Identifying Human Indoor Daily Life Behavior employing Thermal Sensor Arrays (TSAs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Daily activity monitoring systems used in households provide vital information for health status, particularly with aging residents. Multiple approaches have been introduced to achieve such goals, typically obtrusive and non-obtrusive. Amongst the obtrusive approaches are the wearable devices, and among the non-obtrusive approaches are the movement detection systems, including motion sensors and thermal sensor arrays (TSAs). TSA systems are advantageous when preserving a person's privacy and picking his precise spatial location. In this study, human daily living activities were monitored day and night, constructing the corresponding activity time series and spatial probability distribution and employing a TSA system. The monitored activities are classified into two categories: sleeping and daily activity. Results showed the possibility of distinguishing between classes regardless of day and night. The obtained sleep activity duration was compared with previous research using the same raw data. Results showed that the duration of sleep activity, on average, was 9 hours/day, and daily life activity was 7 hours/day. The person's spatial probability distribution was determined using the bivariate distribution for the monitored location. In conclusion, the results showed that sleeping activity was dominant. Our study showed that TSAs were the optimum choice when monitoring human activity. Our proposed approach tackled limitations encountered by previous human activity monitoring systems, such as preserving human privacy while knowing his precise spatial location.</description>

      <title>Frequency Diverse RIS (FD-RIS) Enhanced Wireless Communications via Joint Distance-Angle Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted far-field communication systems can only implement angle beamforming, which actually limits the capability for reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a newly designed frequency diverse RIS (FD-RIS), which can achieve joint distance-angle beamforming with the assistance of the time modulation technology. The signal processing model for FD-RIS-aided wireless communications is first derived. Then, an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the achievable rate is formulated where the frequency-time modulations are jointly optimized to achieve distance-angle beamforming. Furthermore, a novel iterative algorithm based on the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) framework is proposed to effectively handle the non-convex optimization problem. The numerical results validate that the proposed FD-RIS assisted communication scheme can achieve a notable performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme utilizing traditional RIS. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed CEO algorithm is further verified by comparing with the benchmark using the genetic algorithm (GA).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Collective Group Affect: Group-level Annotations and the Multimodal Modeling of Convergence and Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborating in a group, whether face-to-face or virtually, involves continuously expressing emotions and interpreting those of other group members. Therefore, understanding group affect is essential to comprehending how groups interact and succeed in collaborative efforts. In this study, we move beyond individual-level affect and investigate group-level affect -- a collective phenomenon that reflects the shared mood or emotions among group members at a particular moment. As the first in literature, we gather annotations for group-level affective expressions using a fine-grained temporal approach (15 second windows) that also captures the inherent dynamics of the collective construct. To this end, we use trained annotators and an annotation procedure specifically tuned to capture the entire scope of the group interaction. In addition, we model group affect dynamics over time. One way to study the ebb and flow of group affect in group interactions is to model the underlying convergence (driven by emotional contagion) and divergence (resulting from emotional reactivity) of affective expressions amongst group members. To capture these interpersonal dynamics, we extract synchrony based features from both audio and visual social signal cues. An analysis of these features reveals that interacting groups tend to diverge in terms of their social signals along neutral levels of group affect, and converge along extreme levels of affect expression. We further present results on the predictive modeling of dynamic group affect which underscores the importance of using synchrony-based features in the modeling process, as well as the multimodal nature of group affect. We anticipate that the presented models will serve as the baselines of future research on the automatic recognition of dynamic group affect.</description>

      <title>LMAC-TD: Producing Time Domain Explanations for Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are typically black-boxes that remain opaque with regards to their decision mechanisms. Several works in the literature have proposed post-hoc explanation methods to alleviate this issue. This paper proposes LMAC-TD, a post-hoc explanation method that trains a decoder to produce explanations directly in the time domain. This methodology builds upon the foundation of L-MAC, Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers, a method that produces faithful and listenable explanations. We incorporate SepFormer, a popular transformer-based time-domain source separation architecture. We show through a user study that LMAC-TD significantly improves the audio quality of the produced explanations while not sacrificing from faithfulness.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Of Expanding Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online network topology inference for expanding graphs from a stream of spatiotemporal signals. Online algorithms for dynamic graph learning are crucial in delay-sensitive applications or when changes in topology occur rapidly. While existing works focus on inferring the connectivity within a fixed set of nodes, in practice, the graph can grow as new nodes join the network. This poses additional challenges like modeling temporal dynamics involving signals and graphs of different sizes. This growth also increases the computational complexity of the learning process, which may become prohibitive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this setting. We propose a general online algorithm based on projected proximal gradient descent that accounts for the increasing graph size at each iteration. Recursively updating the sample covariance matrix is a key aspect of our approach. We introduce a strategy that enables different types of updates for nodes that just joined the network and for previously existing nodes. To provide further insights into the proposed method, we specialize it in Gaussian Markov random field settings, where we analyze the computational complexity and characterize the dynamic cumulative regret. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both controlled experiments and real-world datasets from epidemic and financial networks.</description>

      <title>Online Network Inference from Graph-Stationary Signals with Hidden Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph learning is the fundamental task of estimating unknown graph connectivity from available data. Typical approaches assume that not only is all information available simultaneously but also that all nodes can be observed. However, in many real-world scenarios, data can neither be known completely nor obtained all at once. We present a novel method for online graph estimation that accounts for the presence of hidden nodes. We consider signals that are stationary on the underlying graph, which provides a model for the unknown connections to hidden nodes. We then formulate a convex optimization problem for graph learning from streaming, incomplete graph signals. We solve the proposed problem through an efficient proximal gradient algorithm that can run in real-time as data arrives sequentially. Additionally, we provide theoretical conditions under which our online algorithm is similar to batch-wise solutions. Through experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the viability of our approach for online graph learning in the presence of missing observations.</description>

      <title>Why some audio signal short-time Fourier transform coefficients have nonuniform phase distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) represents a window of audio samples as a set of complex coefficients. These are advantageously viewed as magnitudes and phases and the overall distribution of phases is very often assumed to be uniform. We show that when audio signal STFT phase distributions are analyzed per-frequency or per-magnitude range, they can be far from uniform. That is, the uniform phase distribution assumption obscures significant important details. We explain the significance of the nonuniform phase distributions and how they might be exploited, derive their source, and explain why the choice of the STFT window shape influences the nonuniformity of the resulting phase distributions.</description>

      <title>Turbo Equalization with Coarse Quantization using the Information Bottleneck Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a turbo equalizer for intersymbol interference channels (ISI) that uses coarsely quantized messages across all receiver components. Lookup tables (LUTs) carry out compression operations designed with the information bottleneck method aiming to maximize relevant mutual information. The turbo setup consists of an equalizer and a decoder that provide extrinsic information to each other over multiple turbo iterations. We develop simplified LUT structures to incorporate the decoder feedback in the equalizer with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed receiver is optimized for selected ISI channels. A conceptual hardware implementation is developed to compare the area efficiency and error correction performance. A thorough analysis reveals that LUT-based configurations with very coarse quantization can achieve higher area efficiency than conventional equalizers. Moreover, the proposed turbo setups can outperform the respective non-turbo setups regarding area efficiency and error correction capability.</description>

      <title>Timing Recovery for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access with Asynchronous Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A passive optical network (PON) based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) meets low latency and high capacity. In the NOMA-PON, the asynchronous clocks between the strong and weak optical network units (ONUs) cause the timing error and phase noise on the signal of the weak ONU. The theoretical derivation shows that the timing error and phase noise can be independently compensated. In this Letter, we propose a timing recovery (TR) algorithm based on an absolute timing error detector (Abs TED) and a pilot-based carrier phase recovery (CPR) to eliminate the timing error and phase noise separately. An experiment for 25G NOMA-PON is set up to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithms. The weak ONU can achieve the 20% soft-decision forward error correction limit after compensating for timing error and phase noise. In conclusion, the proposed TR and the pilot-based CPR show great potential for the NOMA-PON.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Time Frequency Multiplexing (OTFDM): A Novel Waveform Targeted for IMT-2030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) landscape has prompted the International Telecommunications Union Working Party 5D (ITU WP5D) to outline the framework for IMT-2030 and beyond. This next-generation initiative seeks to meet the diverse demands of future networks, with key objectives including hyper-low latency, enhanced energy efficiency, and robust support for high mobility. Current 5th generation (5G) technologies employ waveforms like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). However, these waveforms are insufficient to fully meet the stringent requirements of next-generation communication systems. This paper introduces a novel waveform, Orthogonal Time Frequency Division Multiplexing (OTFDM), designed to address the limitations of existing waveforms. OTFDM achieves ultra-low latency by enabling single-shot transmission of data and Reference Signals (RS) within a single symbol. Furthermore, OTFDM supports high mobility with improved resilience to Doppler shifts and enhances power amplifier efficiency through its low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristics. The proposed waveform incorporates advanced signal processing techniques, including time-frequency multiplexing and frequency domain spectrum shaping, to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI). These techniques enable accurate per-symbol channel estimation, thus supporting higher-order modulations even at higher user speeds. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of OTFDM, demonstrating its capability to support user speeds up to 500 Km/h with minimal RS overhead. This paper explores the technical aspects of OTFDM and discusses its potential implications for the next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Explainable AI in Revolutionizing Human Health Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex nature of disease mechanisms and the variability of patient symptoms present significant obstacles in developing effective diagnostic tools. Although machine learning has made considerable advances in medical diagnosis, its decision-making processes frequently lack transparency, which can jeopardize patient outcomes. This underscores the critical need for Explainable AI (XAI), which not only offers greater clarity but also has the potential to significantly improve patient care. In this literature review, we conduct a detailed analysis of analyzing XAI methods identified through searches across various databases, focusing on chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, stroke, depression, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The literature search revealed the application of 9 trending XAI algorithms in the field of healthcare and highlighted the pros and cons of each of them. Thus, the article is concluded with a critical appraisal of the challenges and future research opportunities for XAI in human health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Differences between Two Maximal Principal Strain Rate Calculation Schemes in Traumatic Brain Analysis with in-vivo and in-silico Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain deformation caused by a head impact leads to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The maximum principal strain (MPS) was used to measure the extent of brain deformation and predict injury, and the recent evidence has indicated that incorporating the maximum principal strain rate (MPSR) and the product of MPS and MPSR, denoted as MPSxSR, enhances the accuracy of TBI prediction. However, ambiguities have arisen about the calculation of MPSR. Two schemes have been utilized: one (MPSR1) is to use the time derivative of MPS, and another (MPSR2) is to use the first eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor. Both MPSR1 and MPSR2 have been applied in previous studies to predict TBI. To quantify the discrepancies between these two methodologies, we conducted a comparison of these two MPSR methodologies across nine in-vivo and in-silico head impact datasets and found that 95MPSR1 was 5.87% larger than 95MPSR2, and 95MPSxSR1 was 2.55% larger than 95MPSxSR2. Across every element in all head impacts, MPSR1 was 8.28% smaller than MPSR2, and MPSxSR1 was 8.11% smaller than MPSxSR2. Furthermore, logistic regression models were trained to predict TBI based on the MPSR (or MPSxSR), and no significant difference was observed in the predictability across different variables. The consequence of misuse of MPSR and MPSxSR thresholds (i.e. compare threshold of 95MPSR1 with value from 95MPSR2 to determine if the impact is injurious) was investigated, and the resulting false rates were found to be around 1%. The evidence suggested that these two methodologies were not significantly different in detecting TBI.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication And Localisation (PASCAL) Under Practical Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a system model called pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) and illustrates its performance in the presence of practical gain and phase imperfections. Specifically, we consider the scenario where multiple single-antenna unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit data packets to a multi-antenna base station (BS) that has the dual responsibility of detecting communication signals and localising UAVs using their pilot symbols. Two forms of receiver signal processing approaches are adopted, including disjoint localisation and communication by using maximum likelihood estimation and multiple signal classification (MUSIC), as well as joint localisation and data detection achieved by the newly proposed algorithms. To evaluate the asymptotic localisation performance in the presence of gain-phase imperfections, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived, while for evaluating the communication's performance, the average sum data rate (SDR) for all the UAVs is derived in closed-form. It is shown that these derived expressions concur with simulations. The results reveal that while the proposed PASCAL system can be sensitive to gain-phase imperfections, it remains to be a powerful and efficient means to achieve reliable simultaneous localisation and communications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient STAR-RIS Enhanced UAV-Enabled MEC Networks with Bi-Directional Task Offloading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme facilitated by the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Unlike existing MEC approaches, the proposed scheme enables bidirectional offloading, allowing users to concurrently offload tasks to the MEC servers located at the ground base station (BS) and UAV with STAR-RIS support. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the system while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) constraints by jointly optimizing the resource allocation, user scheduling, passive beamforming of the STAR-RIS, and the UAV trajectory. A block coordinate descent (BCD) iterative algorithm designed with the Dinkelbach's algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed to effectively handle the formulated non-convex optimization problem with significant coupling among variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed STAR-RIS enhanced UAV-enabled MEC scheme possesses significant advantages in enhancing the system energy efficiency over other baseline schemes including the conventional RIS-aided scheme.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Arithmetic Transceiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmit Signal Design for Multi-Target MIMO Sensing Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transmit signal optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system for sensing the angle information of multiple targets via their reflected echo signals. We consider a challenging and practical scenario where the angles to be sensed are unknown and random, while their probability information is known a priori for exploitation. First, we establish an analytical framework to quantify the multi-target sensing performance exploiting prior distribution information, by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-squared error (MSE) matrix in sensing multiple unknown and random angles. Then, we formulate and study the transmit sample covariance matrix optimization problem to minimize the PCRB for the sum MSE in estimating all angles. Moreover, we propose a sum-of-ratios iterative algorithm which can obtain the optimal solution to the PCRB-minimization problem with low complexity. Numerical results validate our results and the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

Abstract: To reduce the latency of Backpressure (BP) routing in wireless multi-hop networks, we propose to enhance the existing shortest path-biased BP (SP-BP) and sojourn time-based backlog metrics, since they introduce no additional time step-wise signaling overhead to the basic BP. Rather than relying on hop-distance, we introduce a new edge-weighted shortest path bias built on the scheduling duty cycle of wireless links, which can be predicted by a graph convolutional neural network based on the topology and traffic of wireless networks. Additionally, we tackle three long-standing challenges associated with SP-BP: optimal bias scaling, efficient bias maintenance, and integration of delay awareness. Our proposed solutions inherit the throughput optimality of the basic BP, as well as its practical advantages of low complexity and fully distributed implementation. Our approaches rely on common link features and introduces only a one-time constant overhead to previous SP-BP schemes, or a one-time overhead linear in the network size to the basic BP. Numerical experiments show that our solutions can effectively address the major drawbacks of slow startup, random walk, and the last packet problem in basic BP, improving the end-to-end delay of existing low-overhead BP algorithms under various settings of network traffic, interference, and mobility.</description>

Abstract: This letter studies the joint energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR)-based coverage probability in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The UAVs are spatially distributed in an aerial corridor that is modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) binomial point process (BPP). By accurately capturing the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of a UAV through large-scale fading: i) an exact form expression for the energy coverage probability is derived, and ii) a tight approximation for the overall coverage performance is obtained. Among several key findings, numerical results reveal the optimal number of deployed UAV-BSs that maximizes the joint coverage probability, as well as the optimal length of the UAV corridors when designing such UAV-assisted IoT networks.</description>
