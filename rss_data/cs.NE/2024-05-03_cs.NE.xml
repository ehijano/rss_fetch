      <title>Exploring mechanisms of Neural Robustness: probing the bridge between geometry and spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation-optimized artificial neural networks, while precise, lack robustness, leading to unforeseen behaviors that affect their safety. Biological neural systems do solve some of these issues already. Thus, understanding the biological mechanisms of robustness is an important step towards building trustworthy and safe systems. Unlike artificial models, biological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring cell activity. Robustness in neural representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the encoding manifold. Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra, which were observed studying the primary visual cortex of mice, to be indicative of a balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations. Here, we show that unsupervised local learning models with winner takes all dynamics learn such power law representations, providing upcoming studies a mechanistic model with that characteristic. Our research aims to understand the interplay between geometry, spectral properties, robustness, and expressivity in neural representations. Hence, we study the link between representation smoothness and spectrum by using weight, Jacobian and spectral regularization while assessing performance and adversarial robustness. Our work serves as a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying power law spectra and optimally smooth encodings in both biological and artificial systems. The insights gained may elucidate the mechanisms that realize robust neural networks in mammalian brains and inform the development of more stable and reliable artificial systems.</description>

      <title>CUDA-Accelerated Soft Robot Neural Evolution with Large Language Model Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-designing morphology and control in soft robots via a novel neural network evolution approach. We propose an innovative method to implicitly dual-encode soft robots, thus facilitating the simultaneous design of morphology and control. Additionally, we introduce the large language model to serve as the control center during the evolutionary process. This advancement considerably optimizes the evolution speed compared to traditional soft-bodied robot co-design methods. Further complementing our work is the implementation of Gaussian positional encoding - an approach that augments the neural network's comprehension of robot morphology. Our paper offers a new perspective on soft robot design, illustrating substantial improvements in efficiency and comprehension during the design and evolutionary process.</description>

      <title>Direct Training Needs Regularisation: Anytime Optimal Inference Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is acknowledged as the next generation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and hold great promise in effectively processing spatial-temporal information. However, the choice of timestep becomes crucial as it significantly impacts the accuracy of the neural network training. Specifically, a smaller timestep indicates better performance in efficient computing, resulting in reduced latency and operations. While, using a small timestep may lead to low accuracy due to insufficient information presentation with few spikes. This observation motivates us to develop an SNN that is more reliable for adaptive timestep by introducing a novel regularisation technique, namely Spatial-Temporal Regulariser (STR). Our approach regulates the ratio between the strength of spikes and membrane potential at each timestep. This effectively balances spatial and temporal performance during training, ultimately resulting in an Anytime Optimal Inference (AOI) SNN. Through extensive experiments on frame-based and event-based datasets, our method, in combination with cutoff based on softmax output, achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both latency and accuracy. Notably, with STR and cutoff, SNN achieves 2.14 to 2.89 faster in inference compared to the pre-configured timestep with near-zero accuracy drop of 0.50% to 0.64% over the event-based datasets.

      <title>Oxygen vacancies modulated VO2 for neurons and Spiking Neural Network construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neuronal devices are the basic building blocks for neuromorphic computing systems, which have been motivated by realistic brain emulation. Aiming for these applications, various device concepts have been proposed to mimic the neuronal dynamics and functions. While till now, the artificial neuron devices with high efficiency, high stability and low power consumption are still far from practical application. Due to the special insulator-metal phase transition, Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) has been considered as an idea candidate for neuronal device fabrication. However, its intrinsic insulating state requires the VO2 neuronal device to be driven under large bias voltage, resulting in high power consumption and low frequency. Thus in the current study, we have addressed this challenge by preparing oxygen vacancies modulated VO2 film(VO2-x) and fabricating the VO2-x neuronal devices for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) construction. Results indicate the neuron devices can be operated under lower voltage with improved processing speed. The proposed VO2-x based back-propagation SNNs (BP-SNNs) system, trained with the MNIST dataset, demonstrates excellent accuracy in image recognition. Our study not only demonstrates the VO2-x based neurons and SNN system for practical application, but also offers an effective way to optimize the future neuromorphic computing systems by defect engineering strategy.</description>

      <title>Proven Runtime Guarantees for How the \moead Computes the Pareto Front From the Subproblem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) does not directly optimize a given multi-objective function $f$, but instead optimizes $N + 1$ single-objective subproblems of $f$ in a co-evolutionary manner. It maintains an archive of all non-dominated solutions found and outputs it as approximation to the Pareto front. Once the MOEA/D found all optima of the subproblems (the $g$-optima), it may still miss Pareto optima of $f$. The algorithm is then tasked to find the remaining Pareto optima directly by mutating the $g$-optima.
  In this work, we analyze for the first time how the MOEA/D with only standard mutation operators computes the whole Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark when the $g$-optima are a strict subset of the Pareto front. For standard bit mutation, we prove an expected runtime of $O(n N \log n + n^{n/(2N)} N \log n)$ function evaluations. Especially for the second, more interesting phase when the algorithm start with all $g$-optima, we prove an $\Omega(n^{(1/2)(n/N + 1)} \sqrt{N} 2^{-n/N})$ expected runtime. This runtime is super-polynomial if $N = o(n)$, since this leaves large gaps between the $g$-optima, which require costly mutations to cover.
  For power-law mutation with exponent $\beta \in (1, 2)$, we prove an expected runtime of $O\left(n N \log n + n^{\beta} \log n\right)$ function evaluations. The $O\left(n^{\beta} \log n\right)$ term stems from the second phase of starting with all $g$-optima, and it is independent of the number of subproblems $N$. This leads to a huge speedup compared to the lower bound for standard bit mutation. In general, our overall bound for power-law suggests that the MOEA/D performs best for $N = O(n^{\beta - 1})$, resulting in an $O(n^\beta \log n)$ bound. In contrast to standard bit mutation, smaller values of $N$ are better for power-law mutation, as it is capable of easily creating missing solutions.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Redundant Restarts in Multimodal Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Na\"ive restarts of global optimization solvers when operating on multimodal search landscapes may resemble the Coupon's Collector Problem, with a potential to waste significant function evaluations budget on revisiting the same basins of attractions. In this paper, we assess the degree to which such ``duplicate restarts'' occur on standard multimodal benchmark functions, which defines the \textit{redundancy potential} of each particular landscape. We then propose a repelling mechanism to avoid such wasted restarts with the CMA-ES and investigate its efficacy on test cases with high redundancy potential compared to the standard restart mechanism.</description>

      <title>Distributed Representations Enable Robust Multi-Timescale Computation in Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to robustly perform multi-timescale computation remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we show how the distributed approach offered by vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), which uses high-dimensional random vectors as the smallest units of representation, can be leveraged to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms. The transition terms are formed by the VSA binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VSA representations for embedding robust computation with recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. This advances VSAs as a high-level representation-invariant abstract language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Continuously evolving rewards in an open-ended environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unambiguous identification of the rewards driving behaviours of entities operating in complex open-ended real-world environments is difficult, partly because goals and associated behaviours emerge endogenously and are dynamically updated as environments change. Reproducing such dynamics in models would be useful in many domains, particularly where fixed reward functions limit the adaptive capabilities of agents. Simulation experiments described assess a candidate algorithm for the dynamic updating of rewards, RULE: Reward Updating through Learning and Expectation. The approach is tested in a simplified ecosystem-like setting where experiments challenge entities' survival, calling for significant behavioural change. The population of entities successfully demonstrate the abandonment of an initially rewarded but ultimately detrimental behaviour, amplification of beneficial behaviour, and appropriate responses to novel items added to their environment. These adjustment happen through endogenous modification of the entities' underlying reward function, during continuous learning, without external intervention.</description>

      <title>Already Moderate Population Sizes Provably Yield Strong Robustness to Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experience shows that typical evolutionary algorithms can cope well with stochastic disturbances such as noisy function evaluations.
  In this first mathematical runtime analysis of the $(1+\lambda)$ and $(1,\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithms in the presence of prior bit-wise noise, we show that both algorithms can tolerate constant noise probabilities without increasing the asymptotic runtime on the OneMax benchmark. For this, a population size $\lambda$ suffices that is at least logarithmic in the problem size $n$. The only previous result in this direction regarded the less realistic one-bit noise model, required a population size super-linear in the problem size, and proved a runtime guarantee roughly cubic in the noiseless runtime for the OneMax benchmark. Our significantly stronger results are based on the novel proof argument that the noiseless offspring can be seen as a biased uniform crossover between the parent and the noisy offspring. We are optimistic that the technical lemmas resulting from this insight will find applications also in future mathematical runtime analyses of evolutionary algorithms.</description>

      <title>NeuroLGP-SM: Scalable Surrogate-Assisted Neuroevolution for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.</description>
