      <title>A Bayesian Nonparametric Perspective on Mahalanobis Distance for Out of Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian nonparametric methods are naturally suited to the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, these techniques have largely been eschewed in favor of simpler methods based on distances between pre-trained or learned embeddings of data points. Here we show a formal relationship between Bayesian nonparametric models and the relative Mahalanobis distance score (RMDS), a commonly used method for OOD detection. Building on this connection, we propose Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with hierarchical priors that generalize the RMDS. We evaluate these models on the OpenOOD detection benchmark and show that Bayesian nonparametric methods can improve upon existing OOD methods, especially in regimes where training classes differ in their covariance structure and where there are relatively few data points per class.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Evaluation for Recommendations with Missing-Not-At-Random Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unbiased recommender learning (URL) and off-policy evaluation/learning (OPE/L) techniques are effective in addressing the data bias caused by display position and logging policies, thereby consistently improving the performance of recommendations. However, when both bias exits in the logged data, these estimators may suffer from significant bias. In this study, we first analyze the position bias of the OPE estimator when rewards are missing not at random. To mitigate both biases, we propose a novel estimator that leverages two probabilities of logging policies and reward observations as propensity scores. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves superior performance compared to other estimators, even as the levels of bias in reward observations increases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms in Linear Regression under Covariate Shift: On the Importance of Precondition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common pursuit in modern statistical learning is to attain satisfactory generalization out of the source data distribution (OOD). In theory, the challenge remains unsolved even under the canonical setting of covariate shift for the linear model. This paper studies the foundational (high-dimensional) linear regression where the ground truth variables are confined to an ellipse-shape constraint and addresses two fundamental questions in this regime: (i) given the target covariate matrix, what is the min-max \emph{optimal} algorithm under covariate shift? (ii) for what kinds of target classes, the commonly-used SGD-type algorithms achieve optimality? Our analysis starts with establishing a tight lower generalization bound via a Bayesian Cramer-Rao inequality. For (i), we prove that the optimal estimator can be simply a certain linear transformation of the best estimator for the source distribution. Given the source and target matrices, we show that the transformation can be efficiently computed via a convex program. The min-max optimal analysis for SGD leverages the idea that we recognize both the accumulated updates of the applied algorithms and the ideal transformation as preconditions on the learning variables. We provide sufficient conditions when SGD with its acceleration variants attain optimality.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Analysis of Diffusion Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical properties of general diffusion (interpolation) paths and their Langevin Monte Carlo implementation, referred to as diffusion annealed Langevin Monte Carlo (DALMC), under weak conditions on the data distribution. Specifically, we analyse and provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the annealed Langevin dynamics where the path of distributions is defined as Gaussian convolutions of the data distribution as in diffusion models. We then extend our results to recently proposed heavy-tailed (Student's t) diffusion paths, demonstrating their theoretical properties for heavy-tailed data distributions for the first time. Our analysis provides theoretical guarantees for a class of score-based generative models that interpolate between a simple distribution (Gaussian or Student's t) and the data distribution in finite time. This approach offers a broader perspective compared to standard score-based diffusion approaches, which are typically based on a forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noising process.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Rank-Based Objective For Better Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage existing statistical methods to better understand feature learning from data. We tackle this by modifying the model-free variable selection method, Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (FOCI), which is introduced in \cite{azadkia2021simple}. While FOCI is based on a non-parametric coefficient of conditional dependence, we introduce its parametric, differentiable approximation. With this approximate coefficient of correlation, we present a new algorithm called difFOCI, which is applicable to a wider range of machine learning problems thanks to its differentiable nature and learnable parameters. We present difFOCI in three contexts: (1) as a variable selection method with baseline comparisons to FOCI, (2) as a trainable model parametrized with a neural network, and (3) as a generic, widely applicable neural network regularizer, one that improves feature learning with better management of spurious correlations. We evaluate difFOCI on increasingly complex problems ranging from basic variable selection in toy examples to saliency map comparisons in convolutional networks. We then show how difFOCI can be incorporated in the context of fairness to facilitate classifications without relying on sensitive data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$ and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code. Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the hyperpaparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Memory for Online Interdomain Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online regression setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression (OHSGPR), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SGPR inducing points to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate our method on time series regression tasks, showing that it outperforms the existing online GP method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency</description>

      <title>Treatment response as a latent variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientists often need to analyze the samples in a study that responded to treatment in order to refine their hypotheses and find potential causal drivers of response. Natural variation in outcomes makes teasing apart responders from non-responders a statistical inference problem. To handle latent responses, we introduce the causal two-groups (C2G) model, a causal extension of the classical two-groups model. The C2G model posits that treated samples may or may not experience an effect, according to some prior probability. We propose two empirical Bayes procedures for the causal two-groups model, one under semi-parametric conditions and another under fully nonparametric conditions. The semi-parametric model assumes additive treatment effects and is identifiable from observed data. The nonparametric model is unidentifiable, but we show it can still be used to test for response in each treated sample. We show empirically and theoretically that both methods for selecting responders control the false discovery rate at the target level with near-optimal power. We also propose two novel estimands of interest and provide a strategy for deriving estimand intervals in the unidentifiable nonparametric model. On a cancer immunotherapy dataset, the nonparametric C2G model recovers clinically-validated predictive biomarkers of both positive and negative outcomes.

      <title>A First-order Generative Bilevel Optimization Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data samples to synthesize high-quality outputs, have achieved empirical success across domains. However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion models from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become the state-of-the-art for generation tasks across many different data modalities. An important ability of diffusion models is the ability to encode samples from the data distribution back into the sampling prior distribution. This is useful for performing alterations to real data samples along with guided generation via the continuous adjoint equations. We propose an algebraically reversible solver for diffusion SDEs that can exactly invert real data samples into the prior distribution.</description>

Abstract: We provide an approach for the analysis of randomised exploration algorithms like Thompson sampling that does not rely on forced optimism or posterior inflation. With this, we demonstrate that in the $d$-dimensional linear bandit setting, when the action space is smooth and strongly convex, randomised exploration algorithms enjoy an $n$-step regret bound of the order $O(d\sqrt{n} \log(n))$. Notably, this shows for the first time that there exist non-trivial linear bandit settings where Thompson sampling can achieve optimal dimension dependence in the regret.</description>

      <title>WENDy for Nonlinear-in-Parameter ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weak-form Estimation of Non-linear Dynamics (WENDy) algorithm is extended to accommodate systems of ordinary differential equations that are nonlinear-in-parameters (NiP). The extension rests on derived analytic expressions for a likelihood function, its gradient and its Hessian matrix. WENDy makes use of these to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator based on optimization routines suited for non-convex optimization problems. The resulting parameter estimation algorithm has better accuracy, a substantially larger domain of convergence, and is often orders of magnitude faster than the conventional output error least squares method (based on forward solvers).
  The WENDy.jl algorithm is efficiently implemented in Julia. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accommodate the weak form optimization for both additive normal and multiplicative log-normal noise, and present results on a suite of benchmark systems of ordinary differential equations. In order to demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach, we present extensive comparisons between our method and output error methods in terms of accuracy, precision, bias, and coverage.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time User-Level DP-SCO via Robust Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-level differentially private stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) has garnered significant attention due to the paramount importance of safeguarding user privacy in modern large-scale machine learning applications. Current methods, such as those based on differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), often struggle with high noise accumulation and suboptimal utility due to the need to privatize every intermediate iterate. In this work, we introduce a novel linear-time algorithm that leverages robust statistics, specifically the median and trimmed mean, to overcome these challenges. Our approach uniquely bounds the sensitivity of all intermediate iterates of SGD with gradient estimation based on robust statistics, thereby significantly reducing the gradient estimation noise for privacy purposes and enhancing the privacy-utility trade-off. By sidestepping the repeated privatization required by previous methods, our algorithm not only achieves an improved theoretical privacy-utility trade-off but also maintains computational efficiency. We complement our algorithm with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing that our upper bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and the dependence on $\epsilon$. This work sets the stage for more robust and efficient privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning, with implications for future research and application in the field.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Why Data Augmentation Improves Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a cornerstone technique in deep learning, widely used to improve model generalization. Traditional methods like random cropping and color jittering, as well as advanced techniques such as CutOut, Mixup, and CutMix, have achieved notable success across various domains. However, the mechanisms by which data augmentation improves generalization remain poorly understood, and existing theoretical analyses typically focus on individual techniques without a unified explanation. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that elucidates how data augmentation enhances generalization through two key effects: partial semantic feature removal and feature mixing. Partial semantic feature removal reduces the model's reliance on individual feature, promoting diverse feature learning and better generalization. Feature mixing, by scaling down original semantic features and introducing noise, increases training complexity, driving the model to develop more robust features. Advanced methods like CutMix integrate both effects, achieving complementary benefits. Our theoretical insights are further supported by experimental results, validating the effectiveness of this unified perspective.</description>

      <title>What exactly has TabPFN learned to do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TabPFN [Hollmann et al., 2023], a Transformer model pretrained to perform in-context learning on fresh tabular classification problems, was presented at the last ICLR conference. To better understand its behavior, we treat it as a black-box function approximator generator and observe its generated function approximations on a varied selection of training datasets. Exploring its learned inductive biases in this manner, we observe behavior that is at turns either brilliant or baffling. We conclude this post with thoughts on how these results might inform the development, evaluation, and application of prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) in the future.</description>

      <title>Task Generalization With AutoRegressive Compositional Structure: Can Learning From $\d$ Tasks Generalize to $\d^{T}$ Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable task generalization, solving tasks they were never explicitly trained on with only a few demonstrations. This raises a fundamental question: When can learning from a small set of tasks generalize to a large task family? In this paper, we investigate task generalization through the lens of AutoRegressive Compositional (ARC) structure, where each task is a composition of $T$ operations, and each operation is among a finite family of $\d$ subtasks. This yields a total class of size~\( \d^\TT \). We first show that generalization to all \( \d^\TT \) tasks is theoretically achievable by training on only \( \tilde{O}(\d) \) tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that Transformers achieve such exponential task generalization on sparse parity functions via in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We further demonstrate this generalization in arithmetic and language translation, extending beyond parity functions.</description>

      <title>Regularization can make diffusion models more efficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Bandit Multiclass List Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass list classification with (semi-)bandit feedback, where input examples are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible labels, and the feedback consists of the predicted labels which lie in the set of true labels of the given example. Our main result is for the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal hypothesis with high probability using a sample complexity of $O \big( (\mathrm{poly}(K/m) + sm / \varepsilon^2) \log (|H|/\delta) \big)$ where $H$ is the underlying (finite) hypothesis class and $s$ is an upper bound on the number of true labels for a given example. This bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s \ll K$. Moreover, in the regime where $s = O(1)$ the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no cost. Our PAC learning algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $H$. Additionally, we consider the regret minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a regret bound of $\widetilde O(|H| + \sqrt{smT \log |H|})$. Our results generalize and extend those of Erez et al. (2024) who consider the simpler single-label setting corresponding to $s=m=1$, and in fact hold for the more general contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problem with $s$-sparse rewards.</description>

      <title>On Agnostic PAC Learning in the Small Error Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary classification in the classic PAC model exhibits a curious phenomenon: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learners are suboptimal in the realizable case yet optimal in the agnostic case. Roughly speaking, this owes itself to the fact that non-realizable distributions $\mathcal{D}$ are simply more difficult to learn than realizable distributions -- even when one discounts a learner's error by $\mathrm{err}(h^*_{\mathcal{D}})$, the error of the best hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$ for $\mathcal{D}$. Thus, optimal agnostic learners are permitted to incur excess error on (easier-to-learn) distributions $\mathcal{D}$ for which $\tau = \mathrm{err}(h^*_{\mathcal{D}})$ is small.
  Recent work of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24) addresses this shortcoming by including $\tau$ itself as a parameter in the agnostic error term. In this more fine-grained model, they demonstrate tightness of the error lower bound $\tau + \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau (d + \log(1 / \delta))}{m}} + \frac{d + \log(1 / \delta)}{m} \right)$ in a regime where $\tau &gt; d/m$, and leave open the question of whether there may be a higher lower bound when $\tau \approx d/m$, with $d$ denoting $\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{H})$. In this work, we resolve this question by exhibiting a learner which achieves error $c \cdot \tau + O \left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau (d + \log(1 / \delta))}{m}} + \frac{d + \log(1 / \delta)}{m} \right)$ for a constant $c \leq 2.1$, thus matching the lower bound when $\tau \approx d/m$. Further, our learner is computationally efficient and is based upon careful aggregations of ERM classifiers, making progress on two other questions of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24). We leave open the interesting question of whether our approach can be refined to lower the constant from 2.1 to 1, which would completely settle the complexity of agnostic learning.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists.
  As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Utility of Higher-Order Information in Relational Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order information is crucial for relational learning in many domains where relationships extend beyond pairwise interactions. Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling such relationships, which has motivated recent extensions of graph neural net- work architectures to hypergraphs. However, comparisons between hypergraph architectures and standard graph-level models remain limited. In this work, we systematically evaluate a selection of hypergraph-level and graph-level architectures, to determine their effectiveness in leveraging higher-order information in relational learning. Our results show that graph-level architectures applied to hypergraph expansions often outperform hypergraph- level ones, even on inputs that are naturally parametrized as hypergraphs. As an alternative approach for leveraging higher-order information, we propose hypergraph-level encodings based on classical hypergraph characteristics. While these encodings do not significantly improve hypergraph architectures, they yield substantial performance gains when combined with graph-level models. Our theoretical analysis shows that hypergraph-level encodings provably increase the representational power of message-passing graph neural networks beyond that of their graph-level counterparts.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate with Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When deployed in dynamic environments, AI agents will inevitably encounter challenges that exceed their individual capabilities. Leveraging assistance from expert agents-whether human or AI-can significantly enhance safety and performance in such situations. However, querying experts is often costly, necessitating the development of agents that can efficiently request and utilize expert guidance. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental coordination problem called Learning to Yield and Request Control (YRC), where the objective is to learn a strategy that determines when to act autonomously and when to seek expert assistance. We consider a challenging practical setting in which an agent does not interact with experts during training but must adapt to novel environmental changes and expert interventions at test time. To facilitate empirical research, we introduce YRC-Bench, an open-source benchmark featuring diverse domains. YRC-Bench provides a standardized Gym-like API, simulated experts, evaluation pipeline, and implementation of competitive baselines. Towards tackling the YRC problem, we propose a novel validation approach and investigate the performance of various learning methods across diverse environments, yielding insights that can guide future research.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of variational inference in latent variable models for survival analysis, emphasizing the distinctive challenges associated with applying variational methods to survival data. We identify a critical weakness in the existing methodology, demonstrating how a poorly designed variational distribution may hinder the objective of survival analysis tasks--modeling time-to-event distributions. We prove that the optimal variational distribution, which perfectly bounds the log-likelihood, may depend on the censoring mechanism. To address this issue, we propose censor-dependent variational inference (CDVI), tailored for latent variable models in survival analysis. More practically, we introduce CD-CVAE, a V-structure Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed for the scalable implementation of CDVI. Further discussion extends some existing theories and training techniques to survival analysis. Extensive experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate significant improvements in the estimation of individual survival distributions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Rademacher complexity-based approach can generate non-vacuous generalisation bounds on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying a small number of classes of images. The development of new contraction lemmas for high-dimensional mappings between vector spaces for general Lipschitz activation functions is a key technical contribution. These lemmas extend and improve the Talagrand contraction lemma in a variety of cases. Our generalisation bound can improve Golowich et al. for ReLU DNNs. Furthermore, while prior works that use the Rademacher complexity-based approach primarily focus on ReLU DNNs, our results extend to a broader class of activation functions.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Ling et al. investigated the over-parametrized Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) with ReLU activation. They proved that the gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. This paper shows that this fact still holds for DEQs with any general activation that has bounded first and second derivatives. Since the new activation function is generally non-homogeneous, bounding the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix of the equilibrium point is particularly challenging. To accomplish this task, we need to create a novel population Gram matrix and develop a new form of dual activation with Hermite polynomial expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of Generalized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing via Riemannian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic normality guarantee for generalized low-rank matrix sensing -- i.e., matrix sensing under a general convex loss $\bar\ell(\langle X,M\rangle,y^*)$, where $M\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is the unknown rank-$k$ matrix, $X$ is a measurement matrix, and $y^*$ is the corresponding measurement. Our analysis relies on tools from Riemannian geometry to handle degeneracy of the Hessian of the loss due to rotational symmetry in the parameter space. In particular, we parameterize the manifold of low-rank matrices by $\bar\theta\bar\theta^\top$, where $\bar\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$. Then, assuming the minimizer of the empirical loss $\bar\theta^0\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ is in a constant size ball around the true parameters $\bar\theta^*$, we prove $\sqrt{n}(\phi^0-\phi^*)\xrightarrow{D}N(0,(H^*)^{-1})$ as $n\to\infty$, where $\phi^0$ and $\phi^*$ are representations of $\bar\theta^*$ and $\bar\theta^0$ in the horizontal space of the Riemannian quotient manifold $\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}/\text{O}(k)$, and $H^*$ is the Hessian of the true loss in the same representation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical inference with finite-sample validity for the value function of a given policy in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of reinforcement learning. Temporal Difference (TD) learning, arguably the most widely used algorithm for policy evaluation, serves as a natural framework for this purpose. In this paper, we study the consistency properties of TD learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and linear function approximation, and obtain three significant improvements over existing results. First, we derive a novel sharp high-dimensional probability convergence guarantee that depends explicitly on the asymptotic variance and holds under weak conditions. We further establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets that guarantee faster rates than those in the literature. Finally, we propose a plug-in estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix, designed for efficient online computation. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Tighter sparse variational Gaussian processes</title>

Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian process (GP) approximations based on inducing points have become the de facto standard for scaling GPs to large datasets, owing to their theoretical elegance, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation. This paper introduces a provably tighter variational approximation by relaxing the standard assumption that the conditional approximate posterior given the inducing points must match that in the prior. The key innovation is to modify the conditional posterior to have smaller variances than that of the prior at the training points. We derive the collapsed bound for the regression case, describe how to use the proposed approximation in large data settings, and discuss its application to handle orthogonally structured inducing points and GP latent variable models. Extensive experiments on regression benchmarks, classification, and latent variable models demonstrate that the proposed approximation consistently matches or outperforms standard sparse variational GPs while maintaining the same computational cost. An implementation will be made available in all popular GP packages.</description>

      <title>Variable feature weighted fuzzy k-means algorithm for high dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new fuzzy k-means algorithm for the clustering of high-dimensional data in various subspaces. Since high-dimensional data, some features might be irrelevant and relevant but may have different significance in the clustering process. For better clustering, it is crucial to incorporate the contribution of these features in the clustering process. To combine these features, in this paper, we have proposed a novel fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm by modifying the objective function of the fuzzy k-means using two different entropy terms. The first entropy term helps to minimize the within-cluster dispersion and maximize the negative entropy to determine clusters to contribute to the association of data points. The second entropy term helps control the weight of the features because different features have different contributing weights during the clustering to obtain a better partition. The proposed approach performance is presented in various clustering measures (AR, RI and NMI) on multiple datasets and compared with six other state-of-the-art methods. Impact Statement- In real-world applications, cluster-dependent feature weights help in partitioning the data set into more meaningful clusters. These features may be relevant, irrelevant, or redundant, but they each have different contributions during the clustering process. In this paper, a cluster-dependent feature weights approach is presented using fuzzy k-means to assign higher weights to relevant features and lower weights to irrelevant features during clustering. The method is validated using both supervised and unsupervised performance measures on real-world and synthetic datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Effect Measures for Compositional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing effect measures for compositional features are inadequate for many modern applications, for example, in microbiome research, since they display traits such as high-dimensionality and sparsity that can be poorly modelled with traditional parametric approaches. Further, assessing -- in an unbiased way -- how summary statistics of a composition (e.g., racial diversity) affect a response variable is not straightforward. We propose a framework based on hypothetical data perturbations which defines interpretable statistical functionals on the compositions themselves, which we call average perturbation effects. These effects naturally account for confounding that biases frequently used marginal dependence analyses. We show how average perturbation effects can be estimated efficiently by deriving a perturbation-dependent reparametrization and applying semiparametric estimation techniques. We analyze the proposed estimators empirically on simulated and semi-synthetic data and demonstrate advantages over existing techniques on data from New York schools and microbiome data.</description>

      <title>Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance has gained increasing interest in the machine learning community in recent years, as it allows for the comparison of measures in different metric spaces. To overcome the limitations imposed by the equal mass requirements of the classical GW problem, researchers have begun exploring its application in unbalanced settings. However, Unbalanced GW (UGW) can only be regarded as a discrepancy rather than a rigorous metric/distance between two metric measure spaces (mm-spaces). In this paper, we propose a particular case of the UGW problem, termed Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW). We establish that PGW is a well-defined metric between mm-spaces and discuss its theoretical properties, including the existence of a minimizer for the PGW problem and the relationship between PGW and GW, among others. We then propose two variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the PGW problem and show that they are mathematically and computationally equivalent. Moreover, based on our PGW metric, we introduce the analogous concept of barycenters for mm-spaces. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our PGW metric and related solvers in applications such as shape matching, shape retrieval, and shape interpolation, comparing them against existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Transformers Learn Low Sensitivity Functions: Investigations and Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness across many tasks, but an understanding of their inductive biases and how those biases differ from other neural network architectures remains elusive. In this work, we identify the sensitivity of the model to token-wise random perturbations in the input as a unified metric which explains the inductive bias of transformers across different data modalities and distinguishes them from other architectures. We show that transformers have lower sensitivity than MLPs, CNNs, ConvMixers and LSTMs, across both vision and language tasks. We also show that this low-sensitivity bias has important implications: i) lower sensitivity correlates with improved robustness; it can also be used as an efficient intervention to further improve the robustness of transformers; ii) it corresponds to flatter minima in the loss landscape; and iii) it can serve as a progress measure for grokking. We support these findings with theoretical results showing (weak) spectral bias of transformers in the NTK regime, and improved robustness due to the lower sensitivity.

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

      <title>Invariant Graph Learning Meets Information Bottleneck for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a major challenge in graph learning since graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. Invariant learning, aiming to extract invariant features across varied distributions, has recently emerged as a promising approach for OOD generation. Despite the great success of invariant learning in OOD problems for Euclidean data (i.e., images), the exploration within graph data remains constrained by the complex nature of graphs. Existing studies, such as data augmentation or causal intervention, either suffer from disruptions to invariance during the graph manipulation process or face reliability issues due to a lack of supervised signals for causal parts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called Invariant Graph Learning based on Information bottleneck theory (InfoIGL), to extract the invariant features of graphs and enhance models' generalization ability to unseen distributions. Specifically, InfoIGL introduces a redundancy filter to compress task-irrelevant information related to environmental factors. Cooperating with our designed multi-level contrastive learning, we maximize the mutual information among graphs of the same class in the downstream classification tasks, preserving invariant features for prediction to a great extent. An appealing feature of InfoIGL is its strong generalization ability without depending on supervised signal of invariance. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under OOD generalization for graph classification tasks.

      <title>Generating Physical Dynamics under Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimism in the Face of Ambiguity Principle for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms often enjoy optimal regret for adversarial as well as stochastic bandit problems and allow for a streamlined analysis. Nonetheless, FTRL algorithms require the solution of an optimization problem in every iteration and are thus computationally challenging. In contrast, Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) algorithms achieve computational efficiency by perturbing the estimates of the rewards of the arms, but their regret analysis is cumbersome. We propose a new FTPL algorithm that generates optimal policies for both adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits. Like FTRL, our algorithm admits a unified regret analysis, and similar to FTPL, it offers low computational costs. Unlike existing FTPL algorithms that rely on independent additive disturbances governed by a \textit{known} distribution, we allow for disturbances governed by an \textit{ambiguous} distribution that is only known to belong to a given set and propose a principle of optimism in the face of ambiguity. Consequently, our framework generalizes existing FTPL algorithms. It also encapsulates a broad range of FTRL methods as special cases, including several optimal ones, which appears to be impossible with current FTPL methods. Finally, we use techniques from discrete choice theory to devise an efficient bisection algorithm for computing the optimistic arm sampling probabilities. This algorithm is up to $10^4$ times faster than standard FTRL algorithms that solve an optimization problem in every iteration. Our results not only settle existing conjectures but also provide new insights into the impact of perturbations by mapping FTRL to FTPL.</description>

      <title>Lambda-Skip Connections: the architectural component that prevents Rank Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank collapse, a phenomenon where embedding vectors in sequence models rapidly converge to a uniform token or equilibrium state, has recently gained attention in the deep learning literature. This phenomenon leads to reduced expressivity and potential training instabilities due to vanishing gradients. Empirical evidence suggests that architectural components like skip connections, LayerNorm, and MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) play critical roles in mitigating rank collapse. While this issue is well-documented for transformers, alternative sequence models, such as State Space Models (SSMs), which have recently gained prominence, have not been thoroughly examined for similar vulnerabilities. This paper extends the theory of rank collapse from transformers to SSMs using a unifying framework that captures both architectures. We study how a parametrized version of the classic skip connection component, which we call \emph{lambda-skip connections}, provides guarantees for rank collapse prevention. Through analytical results, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee prevention of rank collapse across all the aforementioned architectures. We also study the necessity of this condition via ablation studies and analytical examples. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a general guarantee to prevent rank collapse, and that investigates rank collapse in the context of SSMs, offering valuable understanding for both theoreticians and practitioners. Finally, we validate our findings with experiments demonstrating the crucial role of architectural components such as skip connections and gating mechanisms in preventing rank collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an importance sampling method for tractable and efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions in general settings, named Exogenous Matching. By minimizing a common upper bound of counterfactual estimators, we transform the variance minimization problem into a conditional distribution learning problem, enabling its integration with existing conditional distribution modeling approaches. We validate the theoretical results through experiments under various types and settings of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and demonstrate the outperformance on counterfactual estimation tasks compared to other existing importance sampling methods. We also explore the impact of injecting structural prior knowledge (counterfactual Markov boundaries) on the results. Finally, we apply this method to identifiable proxy SCMs and demonstrate the unbiasedness of the estimates, empirically illustrating the applicability of the method to practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proxy-informed Bayesian transfer learning with unknown sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying and refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target (prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on the target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to address it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of the source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable when differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of latent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations in the target task (cannot "fine-tune"), and instead makes use of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the threat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy information, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy indirect information, such as human feedback, is available.</description>

      <title>Bayesian penalized empirical likelihood and MCMC sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework called Bayesian Penalized Empirical Likelihood (BPEL), designed to address the computational challenges inherent in empirical likelihood (EL) approaches. Our approach has two primary objectives: (i) to enhance the inherent flexibility of EL in accommodating diverse model conditions, and (ii) to facilitate the use of well-established Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling schemes as a convenient alternative to the complex optimization typically required for statistical inference using EL. To achieve the first objective, we propose a penalized approach that regularizes the Lagrange multipliers, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the problem while accommodating a comprehensive set of model conditions. For the second objective, our study designs and thoroughly investigates two popular sampling schemes within the BPEL context. We demonstrate that the BPEL framework is highly flexible and efficient, enhancing the adaptability and practicality of EL methods. Our study highlights the practical advantages of using sampling techniques over traditional optimization methods for EL problems, showing rapid convergence to the global optima of posterior distributions and ensuring the effective resolution of complex statistical inference challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning convolution operators associated to compact Abelian groups. We study a regularization-based approach and provide corresponding learning guarantees, discussing natural regularity condition on the convolution kernel. More precisely, we assume the convolution kernel is a function in a translation invariant Hilbert space and analyze a natural ridge regression (RR) estimator. Building on existing results for RR, we characterize the accuracy of the estimator in terms of finite sample bounds. Interestingly, regularity assumptions which are classical in the analysis of RR, have a novel and natural interpretation in terms of space/frequency localization. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of shared linear representations beyond well-specified linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by multi-task and meta-learning approaches, we consider the problem of learning structure shared by tasks or users, such as shared low-rank representations or clustered structures. While all previous works focus on well-specified linear regression, we consider more general convex objectives, where the structural low-rank and cluster assumptions are expressed on the optima of each function. We show that under mild assumptions such as \textit{Hessian concentration} and \textit{noise concentration at the optimum}, rank and clustered regularized estimators recover such structure, provided the number of samples per task and the number of tasks are large enough. We then study the problem of recovering the subspace in which all the solutions lie, in the setting where there is only a single sample per task: we show that in that case, the rank-constrained estimator can recover the subspace, but that the number of tasks needs to scale exponentially large with the dimension of the subspace. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm via nuclear norm constraints for learning a shared linear representation in the context of convex learning objectives.</description>

      <title>A Bias-Correction Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Algorithm with Momentum Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed stochastic optimization algorithms can simultaneously process large-scale datasets, significantly accelerating model training. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by the sparsity of distributed networks and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a momentum-accelerated distributed stochastic gradient algorithm, termed Exact-Diffusion with Momentum (EDM), which mitigates the bias from data heterogeneity and incorporates momentum techniques commonly used in deep learning to enhance convergence rate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the EDM algorithm converges sub-linearly to the neighborhood of the optimal solution, the radius of which is irrespective of data heterogeneity, when applied to non-convex objective functions; under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is a weaker assumption than strong convexity, it converges linearly to the target region. Our analysis techniques employed to handle momentum in complex distributed parameter update structures yield a sufficiently tight convergence upper bound, offering a new perspective for the theoretical analysis of other momentum-based distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Value of Prediction in Identifying the Worst-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in government programs to identify and support the most vulnerable individuals, prioritizing assistance for those at greatest risk over optimizing aggregate outcomes. This paper examines the welfare impacts of prediction in equity-driven contexts, and how they compare to other policy levers, such as expanding bureaucratic capacity. Through mathematical models and a real-world case study on long-term unemployment amongst German residents, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness of prediction in surfacing the worst-off. Our findings provide clear analytical frameworks and practical, data-driven tools that empower policymakers to make principled decisions when designing these systems.</description>
