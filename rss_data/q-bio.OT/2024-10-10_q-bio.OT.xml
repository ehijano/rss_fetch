      <title>On the concentration and energetic content of nectar sugars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sugar concentration of nectar is a key metric for describing nectar composition and a major factor influencing pollinator visitation to flowers. Across pollination biology research there are multiple approaches in use for describing nectar sugar concentration. With these different approaches there are several potential sources of confusion which, if not accounted for, can lead to errors. Further potential for error arises if researchers wish to make comparisons between the energetic content of nectars containing different ratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose. Regardless of whether concentration is measured per mole or per unit mass, the energetic content differs between the hexose sugars (glucose and fructose) and sucrose. Appropriate conversion is needed for direct comparison. Here we address these two issues with the following aims. We consolidate the literature on this topic with examples of the different methods for reporting nectar sugar concentrations, provide insight into potential sources of error, and derive equations for converting between the different ways of expressing sugar concentration for the three primary nectar sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. Second, we discuss the relative energetic content of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and rationalise adjustment of "energetic value" rather than reporting concentration directly. In this way, we hope to harmonise ongoing work in pollination ecology.</description>
