      <title>Inferring Coupled Stuart-Landau Equations from Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to infer phase-amplitude equations of coupled limit-cycle oscillators directly from waveform measurements. Exploiting the universality of the Stuart-Landau normal form near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, we reconstruct a near-identity transformation from two independent observables of an isolated oscillator and infer the intrinsic Stuart-Landau parameters. Using this reconstructed transformation, we then estimate linear coupling coefficients from paired measurements. The method accurately recovers parameters for coupled van der Pol oscillators, providing a quantitative benchmark. Applied to a high-dimensional hydrodynamic system of two coupled collapsible-channel oscillators, the inferred Stuart-Landau model captures bistability between in-phase and anti-phase synchronization and reveals that the anti-phase state is destabilized through a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Our approach enables quantitative prediction of synchronization transitions involving amplitude dynamics from experimentally accessible waveform data.</description>

      <title>Topological Reorganization and Coordination-Controlled Crossover in Synchronization Onset on Regular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to global synchronization in coupled dynamical systems is governed by the interplay between coupling strength and structural topology. Although abrupt, first-order-like synchronization transitions have been extensively reported in heterogeneous networks, it is unclear whether comparable accelerated onset behavior can emerge purely from coordination geometry in spatially homogeneous, regular lattices. In this study, we investigate large-scale ($N=10^5$) stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillator networks defined on regular lattices with controlled coordination number. Using topological data analysis (TDA), simplicial-complex characterization, and optimal-transport-based geometric diagnostics, we identify a coordination-controlled crossover in synchronization onset dynamics at approximately $z_{c} \approx 7$ within the class of regular lattices considered. Low-coordination lattices ($z &lt; z_{c}$) exhibit persistent $H_2$ topological features in the dynamical amplitude field that correlate with delayed coherence and surface-limited propagation. In contrast, higher-coordination lattices ($z &gt; z_{c}$) display rapid fragmentation of these features, reduced interface roughness, and predominantly positive Ricci curvature. This is consistent with enhanced path redundancy and improved transport efficiency. In this regime, the global order parameter exhibits accelerated exponential-like growth during the onset stage. Throughout this work, abrupt synchronization refers specifically to this exponential onset behavior rather than to thermodynamic first-order hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that increasing coordination density induces a qualitative reorganization of higher-order topological structure that strongly correlates with synchronization efficiency in regular lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Wavefront propagation in a bistable dual-delayed-feedback oscillator: analogy to networks with nonlocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present research, a bistable delayed-feedback oscillator with two delayed-feedback loops is shown to replicate a network of bistable nodes with nonlocal coupling. It is demonstrated that certain aspects of the nonlocal interaction impact on wavefront propagation identified in networks of bistable elements are entirely reproduced in the dynamics of a single oscillator with two delays. In particular, adding the second delayed-feedback loop allows speeding up both deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation, achieving stabilization of propagating fronts at lower noise intensity and preventing fronts from noise-induced destruction occurring in the presence of single delayed-feedback. All the revealed effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence.</description>
