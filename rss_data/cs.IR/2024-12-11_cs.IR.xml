      <title>Enhancing Prediction Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large-scale news recommendation system implemented at Ringier Axel Springer Polska, focusing on enhancing prediction models with reinforcement learning techniques. The system, named Aureus, integrates a variety of algorithms, including multi-armed bandit methods and deep learning models based on large language models (LLMs). We detail the architecture and implementation of Aureus, emphasizing the significant improvements in online metrics achieved by combining ranking prediction models with reinforcement learning. The paper further explores the impact of different models mixing on key business performance indicators. Our approach effectively balances the need for personalized recommendations with the ability to adapt to rapidly changing news content, addressing common challenges such as the cold start problem and content freshness. The results of online evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in a real-world production environment.</description>

      <title>Generating Diverse Synthetic Datasets for Evaluation of Real-life Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets are important for evaluating and testing machine learning models. When evaluating real-life recommender systems, high-dimensional categorical (and sparse) datasets are often considered. Unfortunately, there are not many solutions that would allow generation of artificial datasets with such characteristics. For that purpose, we developed a novel framework for generating synthetic datasets that are diverse and statistically coherent. Our framework allows for creation of datasets with controlled attributes, enabling iterative modifications to fit specific experimental needs, such as introducing complex feature interactions, feature cardinality, or specific distributions. We demonstrate the framework's utility through use cases such as benchmarking probabilistic counting algorithms, detecting algorithmic bias, and simulating AutoML searches. Unlike existing methods that either focus narrowly on specific dataset structures, or prioritize (private) data synthesis through real data, our approach provides a modular means to quickly generating completely synthetic datasets we can tailor to diverse experimental requirements. Our results show that the framework effectively isolates model behavior in unique situations and highlights its potential for significant advancements in the evaluation and development of recommender systems. The readily-available framework is available as a free open Python package to facilitate research with minimal friction.</description>

      <title>Bridging Conversational and Collaborative Signals for Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) leverage contextual information from conversations to generate recommendations but often struggle due to a lack of collaborative filtering (CF) signals, which capture user-item interaction patterns essential for accurate recommendations. We introduce Reddit-ML32M, a dataset that links reddit conversations with interactions on MovieLens 32M, to enrich item representations by leveraging collaborative knowledge and addressing interaction sparsity in conversational datasets. We propose an LLM-based framework that uses Reddit-ML32M to align LLM-generated recommendations with CF embeddings, refining rankings for better performance. We evaluate our framework against three sets of baselines: CF-based recommenders using only interactions from CRS tasks, traditional CRS models, and LLM-based methods relying on conversational context without item representations. Our approach achieves consistent improvements, including a 12.32% increase in Hit Rate and a 9.9% improvement in NDCG, outperforming the best-performing baseline that relies on conversational context but lacks collaborative item representations.</description>

      <title>CURE: Clinical Understanding &amp; Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the dominance of dense retrievers that do not generalize well beyond their training dataset distributions, domain-specific test sets are essential in evaluating retrieval. There are few test datasets for retrieval systems intended for use by healthcare providers in a point-of-care setting. To fill this gap we have collaborated with medical professionals to create CURE, an ad-hoc retrieval test dataset for passage ranking with 2000 queries spanning 10 medical domains with a monolingual (English) and two cross-lingual (French/Spanish -&gt; English) conditions. In this paper, we describe how CURE was constructed and provide baseline results to showcase its effectiveness as an evaluation tool.

      <title>IntellectSeeker: A Personalized Literature Management System with the Probabilistic Model and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faced with the burgeoning volume of academic literature, researchers often need help with uncertain article quality and mismatches in term searches using traditional academic engines. We introduce IntellectSeeker, an innovative and personalized intelligent academic literature management platform to address these challenges. This platform integrates a Large Language Model (LLM)--based semantic enhancement bot with a sophisticated probability model to personalize and streamline literature searches. We adopted the GPT-3.5-turbo model to transform everyday language into professional academic terms across various scenarios using multiple rounds of few-shot learning. This adaptation mainly benefits academic newcomers, effectively bridging the gap between general inquiries and academic terminology. The probabilistic model intelligently filters academic articles to align closely with the specific interests of users, which are derived from explicit needs and behavioral patterns. Moreover, IntellectSeeker incorporates an advanced recommendation system and text compression tools. These features enable intelligent article recommendations based on user interactions and present search results through concise one-line summaries and innovative word cloud visualizations, significantly enhancing research efficiency and user experience. IntellectSeeker offers academic researchers a highly customizable literature management solution with exceptional search precision and matching capabilities.

      <title>Temporal Linear Item-Item Model for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sequential recommendation (SR), neural models have been actively explored due to their remarkable performance, but they suffer from inefficiency inherent to their complexity. On the other hand, linear SR models exhibit high efficiency and achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to neural models. However, they solely deal with the sequential order of items (i.e., sequential information) and overlook the actual timestamp (i.e., temporal information). It is limited to effectively capturing various user preference drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose a novel linear SR model, named TemporAl LinEar item-item model (TALE), incorporating temporal information while preserving training/inference efficiency, with three key components. (i) Single-target augmentation concentrates on a single target item, enabling us to learn the temporal correlation for the target item. (ii) Time interval-aware weighting utilizes the actual timestamp to discern the item correlation depending on time intervals. (iii) Trend-aware normalization reflects the dynamic shift of item popularity over time. Our empirical studies show that TALE outperforms ten competing SR models by up to 18.71% gains on five benchmark datasets. It also exhibits remarkable effectiveness in evaluating long-tail items by up to 30.45% gains. The source code is available at https://github.com/psm1206/TALE.</description>

      <title>RLT4Rec: Reinforcement Learning Transformer for User Cold Start and Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new sequential transformer reinforcement learning architecture RLT4Rec and demonstrate that it achieves excellent performance in a range of item recommendation tasks. RLT4Rec uses a relatively simple transformer architecture that takes as input the user's (item,rating) history and outputs the next item to present to the user. Unlike existing RL approaches, there is no need to input a state observation or estimate. RLT4Rec handles new users and established users within the same consistent framework and automatically balances the "exploration" needed to discover the preferences of a new user with the "exploitation" that is more appropriate for established users. Training of RLT4Rec is robust and fast and is insensitive to the choice of training data, learning to generate "good" personalised sequences that the user tends to rate highly even when trained on "bad" data.</description>

      <title>SST framework for Document Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form document matching aims to judge the relevance between two documents and has been applied to various scenarios. Most existing works utilize hierarchical or long context models to process documents, which achieve coarse understanding but may ignore details. Some researchers construct a document view with similar sentences about aligned document subtopics to focus on detailed matching signals. However, a long document generally contains multiple subtopics. The matching signals are heterogeneous from multiple topics. Considering only the homologous aligned subtopics may not be representative enough and may cause biased modeling. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to model representative matching signals. First, we propose to capture various matching signals through subtopics of document pairs. Next, We construct multiple document views based on subtopics to cover heterogeneous and valuable details. However, existing spatial aggregation methods like attention, which integrate all these views simultaneously, are hard to integrate heterogeneous information. Instead, we propose temporal aggregation, which effectively integrates different views gradually as the training progresses. Experimental results show that our learning framework is effective on several document-matching tasks, including news duplication and legal case retrieval.</description>

      <title>Benchmark for Evaluation and Analysis of Citation Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citation recommendation systems have attracted much academic interest, resulting in many studies and implementations. These systems help authors automatically generate proper citations by suggesting relevant references based on the text they have written. However, the methods used in citation recommendation differ across various studies and implementations. Some approaches focus on the overall content of papers, while others consider the context of the citation text. Additionally, the datasets used in these studies include different aspects of papers, such as metadata, citation context, or even the full text of the paper in various formats and structures. The diversity in models, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it challenging to assess and compare citation recommendation methods effectively. To address this issue, a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics are needed to evaluate these models consistently. Therefore, we propose developing a benchmark specifically designed to analyze and compare citation recommendation models. This benchmark will evaluate the performance of models on different features of the citation context and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models across all these tasks, presenting the results in a standardized way. By creating a benchmark with standardized evaluation metrics, researchers and practitioners in the field of citation recommendation will have a common platform to assess and compare different models. This will enable meaningful comparisons and help identify promising approaches for further research and development in the field.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</description>

      <title>RAG-based Question Answering over Heterogeneous Data and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the QUASAR system for question answering over unstructured text, structured tables, and knowledge graphs, with unified treatment of all sources. The system adopts a RAG-based architecture, with a pipeline of evidence retrieval followed by answer generation, with the latter powered by a moderate-sized language model. Additionally and uniquely, QUASAR has components for question understanding, to derive crisper input for evidence retrieval, and for re-ranking and filtering the retrieved evidence before feeding the most informative pieces into the answer generation. Experiments with three different benchmarks demonstrate the high answering quality of our approach, being on par with or better than large GPT models, while keeping the computational cost and energy consumption orders of magnitude lower.</description>

      <title>Bilingual BSARD: Extending Statutory Article Retrieval to Dutch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statutory article retrieval plays a crucial role in making legal information more accessible to both laypeople and legal professionals. Multilingual countries like Belgium present unique challenges for retrieval models due to the need for handling legal issues in multiple languages. Building on the Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD) in French, we introduce the bilingual version of this dataset, bBSARD. The dataset contains parallel Belgian statutory articles in both French and Dutch, along with legal questions from BSARD and their Dutch translation. Using bBSARD, we conduct extensive benchmarking of retrieval models available for Dutch and French. Our benchmarking setup includes lexical models, zero-shot dense models, and fine-tuned small foundation models. Our experiments show that BM25 remains a competitive baseline compared to many zero-shot dense models in both languages. We also observe that while proprietary models outperform open alternatives in the zero-shot setting, they can be matched or surpassed by fine-tuning small language-specific models. Our dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document content extraction is crucial in computer vision, especially for meeting the high-quality data needs of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies. However, current document parsing methods suffer from significant limitations in terms of diversity and comprehensive evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniDocBench, a novel multi-source benchmark designed to advance automated document content extraction. OmniDocBench includes a meticulously curated and annotated high-quality evaluation dataset comprising nine diverse document types, such as academic papers, textbooks, slides, among others. Our benchmark provides a flexible and comprehensive evaluation framework with 19 layout category labels and 14 attribute labels, enabling multi-level assessments across entire datasets, individual modules, or specific data types. Using OmniDocBench, we perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of existing modular pipelines and multimodal end-to-end methods, highlighting their limitations in handling document diversity and ensuring fair evaluation. OmniDocBench establishes a robust, diverse, and fair evaluation standard for the document content extraction field, offering crucial insights for future advancements and fostering the development of document parsing technologies. The codes and dataset is available in https://github.com/opendatalab/OmniDocBench.</description>

      <title>Hypergrah-Enhanced Dual Convolutional Network for Bundle Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bundle recommendations strive to offer users a set of items as a package named bundle, enhancing convenience and contributing to the seller's revenue. While previous approaches have demonstrated notable performance, we argue that they may compromise the ternary relationship among users, items, and bundles. This compromise can result in information loss, ultimately impacting the overall model performance. To address this gap, we develop a unified model for bundle recommendation, termed hypergraph-enhanced dual convolutional neural network (HED). Our approach is characterized by two key aspects. Firstly, we construct a complete hypergraph to capture interaction dynamics among users, items, and bundles. Secondly, we incorporate U-B interaction information to enhance the information representation derived from users and bundle embedding vectors. Extensive experimental results on the Youshu and Netease datasets have demonstrated that HED surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, proving its effectiveness. In addition, various ablation studies and sensitivity analyses revealed the working mechanism and proved our effectiveness. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/AAI-Lab/HED</description>

      <title>CFaiRLLM: Consumer Fairness Evaluation in Large-Language Model Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work takes a critical stance on previous studies concerning fairness evaluation in Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommender systems, which have primarily assessed consumer fairness by comparing recommendation lists generated with and without sensitive user attributes. Such approaches implicitly treat discrepancies in recommended items as biases, overlooking whether these changes might stem from genuine personalization aligned with true preferences of users. Moreover, these earlier studies typically address single sensitive attributes in isolation, neglecting the complex interplay of intersectional identities. In response to these shortcomings, we introduce CFaiRLLM, an enhanced evaluation framework that not only incorporates true preference alignment but also rigorously examines intersectional fairness by considering overlapping sensitive attributes. Additionally, CFaiRLLM introduces diverse user profile sampling strategies-random, top-rated, and recency-focused-to better understand the impact of profile generation fed to LLMs in light of inherent token limitations in these systems. Given that fairness depends on accurately understanding users' tastes and preferences,, these strategies provide a more realistic assessment of fairness within RecLLMs.
  The results demonstrated that true preference alignment offers a more personalized and fair assessment compared to similarity-based measures, revealing significant disparities when sensitive and intersectional attributes are incorporated. Notably, our study finds that intersectional attributes amplify fairness gaps more prominently, especially in less structured domains such as music recommendations in LastFM.</description>

      <title>Causal Deconfounding via Confounder Disentanglement for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to capture comprehensive user preferences in order to ultimately enhance the recommendation accuracy in both data-richer and data-sparser domains simultaneously. However, in addition to users' true preferences, the user-item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding framework via Confounder Disentanglement for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called CD2CDR. In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>LEARN: Knowledge Adaptation from Large Language Model to Recommendation for Practical Industrial Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems predominantly rely on ID embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on six Amazon Review datasets to verify the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Collaborative Filtering: A Variational AutoEncoder Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Collaborative Filtering (FedCF) is an emerging field focused on developing a new recommendation framework with preserving privacy in a federated setting. Existing FedCF methods typically combine distributed Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms with privacy-preserving mechanisms, and then preserve personalized information into a user embedding vector. However, the user embedding is usually insufficient to preserve the rich information of the fine-grained personalization across heterogeneous clients. This paper proposes a novel personalized FedCF method by preserving users' personalized information into a latent variable and a neural model simultaneously. Specifically, we decompose the modeling of user knowledge into two encoders, each designed to capture shared knowledge and personalized knowledge separately. A personalized gating network is then applied to balance personalization and generalization between the global and local encoders. Moreover, to effectively train the proposed framework, we model the CF problem as a specialized Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) task by integrating user interaction vector reconstruction with missing value prediction. The decoder is trained to reconstruct the implicit feedback from items the user has interacted with, while also predicting items the user might be interested in but has not yet interacted with. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, showcasing superior performance.

      <title>BayesCNS: A Unified Bayesian Approach to Address Cold Start and Non-Stationarity in Search Systems at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems used in search and recommendation platforms frequently employ Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models to rank items in response to user queries. These models heavily rely on features derived from user interactions, such as clicks and engagement data. This dependence introduces cold start issues for items lacking user engagement and poses challenges in adapting to non-stationary shifts in user behavior over time. We address both challenges holistically as an online learning problem and propose BayesCNS, a Bayesian approach designed to handle cold start and non-stationary distribution shifts in search systems at scale. BayesCNS achieves this by estimating prior distributions for user-item interactions, which are continuously updated with new user interactions gathered online. This online learning procedure is guided by a ranker model, enabling efficient exploration of relevant items using contextual information provided by the ranker. We successfully deployed BayesCNS in a large-scale search system and demonstrated its efficacy through comprehensive offline and online experiments. Notably, an online A/B experiment showed a 10.60% increase in new item interactions and a 1.05% improvement in overall success metrics over the existing production baseline.</description>

      <title>S+t-SNE -- Bringing Dimensionality Reduction to Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present S+t-SNE, an adaptation of the t-SNE algorithm designed to handle infinite data streams. The core idea behind S+t-SNE is to update the t-SNE embedding incrementally as new data arrives, ensuring scalability and adaptability to handle streaming scenarios. By selecting the most important points at each step, the algorithm ensures scalability while keeping informative visualisations. By employing a blind method for drift management, the algorithm adjusts the embedding space, which facilitates the visualisation of evolving data dynamics. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of S+t-SNE, whilst highlighting its ability to capture patterns in a streaming scenario. We hope our approach offers researchers and practitioners a real-time tool for understanding and interpreting high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Query Routing in Clustering-based Approximate Maximum Inner Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering-based nearest neighbor search is an effective method in which points are partitioned into geometric shards to form an index, with only a few shards searched during query processing to find a set of top-$k$ vectors. Even though the search efficacy is heavily influenced by the algorithm that identifies the shards to probe, it has received little attention in the literature. This work bridges that gap by studying routing in clustering-based maximum inner product search. We unpack existing routers and notice the surprising contribution of optimism. We then take a page from the sequential decision making literature and formalize that insight following the principle of ``optimism in the face of uncertainty.'' In particular, we present a framework that incorporates the moments of the distribution of inner products within each shard to estimate the maximum inner product. We then present an instance of our algorithm that uses only the first two moments to reach the same accuracy as state-of-the-art routers such as ScaNN by probing up to $50\%$ fewer points on benchmark datasets. Our algorithm is also space-efficient: we design a sketch of the second moment whose size is independent of the number of points and requires $\mathcal{O}(1)$ vectors per shard.</description>

      <title>Beyond Retrieval: Generating Narratives in Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in Large Language Model's generation and reasoning capabilities present an opportunity to develop truly conversational recommendation systems. However, effectively integrating recommender system knowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards recommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by making two key contributions.
  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation tasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich user narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences, product endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase history. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research. Furthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and perform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second, the paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves as a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first attempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender signals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based CF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and personalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining CF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language metrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also provide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to this new generative task.</description>

      <title>Argumentative Experience: Reducing Confirmation Bias on Controversial Issues through LLM-Generated Multi-Persona Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling designers to give life to exciting new user experiences for information access. In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased?
  Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</description>

      <title>LLMs-as-Judges: A Comprehensive Survey on LLM-based Evaluation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven their expanding application across various fields. One of the most promising applications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses, referred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness, ability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural language. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges paradigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications, Meta-evaluation, and Limitations. We begin by providing a systematic definition of LLMs-as-Judges and introduce their functionality (Why use LLM judges?). Then we address methodology to construct an evaluation system with LLMs (How to use LLM judges?). Additionally, we investigate the potential domains for their application (Where to use LLM judges?) and discuss methods for evaluating them in various contexts (How to evaluate LLM judges?). Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of LLM judges and discuss potential future directions. Through a structured and comprehensive analysis, we aim aims to provide insights on the development and application of LLMs-as-judges in both research and practice. We will continue to maintain the relevant resource list at https://github.com/CSHaitao/Awesome-LLMs-as-Judges.</description>
