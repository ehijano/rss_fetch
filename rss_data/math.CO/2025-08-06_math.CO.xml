      <title>Spectral extremal problem of the $p$th power of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a cycle $C_k$ on $k$ vertices, its $p$-th power, denoted $C_k^p$, is the graph obtained by adding edges between all pairs of vertices at distance at most $p$ in $C_k$. Let $\ex(n, F)$ and $\spex(n, F)$ denote the maximum possible number of edges and the maximum possible spectral radius, respectively, among all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. In this paper, we determine precisely the unique extremal graph achieving $\ex(n, C_k^p)$ and $\spex(n, C_k^p)$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>A spectral condition for Hamilton cycles in tough bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. The {\em spectral radius} of $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. For a non-complete bipartite graph $G$ with parts $X$ and $Y$, the {\em bipartite toughness} of $G$ is defined as $t^{B}(G)=\min\left\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}\right\}$, where the minimum is taken over all proper subsets $S\subset X$ (or $S\subset Y$) such that $c(G-S)&gt;1$. In this paper, we give a sharp spectral radius condition for balanced bipartite graphs $G$ with $t^{B}(G)\geq1$ to guarantee that $G$ contains Hamilton cycles. This solves a problem proposed in \cite{CFL}.</description>

      <title>Slow graph bootstrap percolation III: Chain constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $H$, we study the extremal function $M_H(n)$ which is the maximum running time (until stabilisation) of an $H$-bootstrap percolation process on $n$ vertices. Building on previous work in the clique case $H=K_k$, we develop a general framework of chain constructions. We demonstrate the flexibility of this framework by applying several variations of the method to give lower bounds on $M_H(n)$ for a wide variety of different graphs $H$ including dense graphs, random graphs and complete bipartite graphs. In particular, we focus on the question of whether $M_H(n)$ is (almost) quadratic or not and our lower bounds develop connections with additive combinatorics, utilising constructions of sets free of solutions to certain linear equations. Finally, our lower bounds are complemented by upper bounds which connect $M_H(n)$ to other problems in extremal graph theory such as the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi (6,3)-Theorem.</description>

      <title>On a class of quasi-Hermitian surfaces in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], a new quasi-Hermitian variety $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^r$ in $\mathrm{PG}(r, q^2)$, with $q = 2^e$ and $e \geq 3$ an odd integer, was constructed. The variety depends on a primitive element $\varepsilon$ of the underlying field $\mathrm{GF}(q^2)$.11
  In the present paper, we first provide a classification of such varieties up to projective equivalence in finite projective spaces of arbitrary dimension. Then, we focus on the case $r = 3$ and study the structure of the lines contained in $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^3$; as a consequence, we determine the full automorphism group of $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^3$ . Finally, as a byproduct, we prove the equivalence of certain minimal codes introduced in [3].</description>

      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we consider a new notion of affine spectral-independence in designing random walks. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancy across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancy at any point during the process. This technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of independence attractors of graphs with independence number three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An independent set in a simple graph $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in $G$. The independence polynomial of $G$, denoted by $I_G$ is defined as $1 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_d z^{d}$, where $a_i$ denotes the number of independent sets with cardinality $i$ and $d$ is the cardinality of a largest independent set in $G$. This $d$ is known as the independence number of $G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself. The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is defined as $\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim\limits_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric defined on the space of all compact subsets of the plane. This paper investigates the connectedness of the independence attractors of all graphs with independence number three. Let the independence polynomial of $G$ be $1+a_1 z +a_2 z^2 +a_3 z^3$. For $a_1 =3$, $\mathcal{A}(G)$ turns out to be $ \{-1\} \cup \{z: |z+1|=1\} $. For $a_1 &gt;3$, we prove the following.
  If $a_2 ^2 \leq 3 a_1 a_3$, or $3 a_1 a_3 &lt; a_2 ^2 &lt; 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is totally disconnected. For $a_2 ^2 =4a_3 (a_1 -1) $, $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is connected when $a_1 =5$ and is disconnected but not totally disconnected for all other values of $a_1$. If $a_2 ^2 &gt; 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then $\mathcal{A}(G)$ can be connected, totally disconnected or disconnected but not totally disconnected depending on further conditions involving $a_1, a_2$ and $a_3$. Examples of graphs exhibiting all the possibilities are provided.</description>

      <title>When Are Standard Graph Products Isomorphic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the isomorphism problem for graphs derived from the four standard graph products: Cartesian, Kronecker (direct), strong, and lexicographic product. We provide a complete characterization of all simple connected graphs for which their corresponding products are isomorphic. As a by-product, we identify a novel family of non-distance-regular graphs that possess fewer than d+1 distinct distance eigenvalues, where d represents the diameter of the graph. This result offers a new perspective on Problem 4.3 posed in [2], moving beyond the current approaches.</description>

      <title>Sums of Laplacian eigenvalues and sums of degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a simplicial complex. For $1\le i\le\dim(X)$, let $X(i)$ be the set of $i$-dimensional faces of $X$, and let $f_i(X)=|X(i)|$. For $0\le i\le \dim(X)-1$, let $L_i^+(X)$ be the $i$-th upper Laplacian operator of $X$. For $\sigma\in X$ and $1\le r\le \dim(X)$, we denote by $\text{deg}_X^{(r)}(\sigma)$ the number of $r$-dimensional faces of $X$ containing $\sigma$. For a symmetric matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $1\le i\le n$, let $\lambda_i(M)$ be the $i$-th largest eigenvalue of $M$. We prove that for every complex $X$, $1\le r\le\dim(X)$, and $1\le k\le f_{r-1}(X)/(r+1)$, \[ \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le \max \left\{ \sum_{\sigma\in A} \text{deg}_X^{(r)}(\sigma) :\, A\subset X(r-1),\, |A|=(r+1)k \right\}. \] This bound is sharp, and it extends a classical result of Anderson and Morley, corresponding to the special case $k=1,\, r=1$. As a consequence, we show that for all $1\le r\le \dim(X)$ and $1\le k\le f_{r-1}(X)$, \[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le f_r(X) + \binom{(r+1)k}{2}. \] In the case $r=1$, we obtain the following improved bound: for every $k\ge 1$ and every graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\ge k$, \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq |E|+k^2, \] where $L(G)=L_0^{+}(G)$ is the Laplacian matrix of $G$. This improves upon previously known bounds for all $k\ge 3$, and may be seen as a further step towards Brouwer's conjecture, which states that $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq |E|+\binom{k+1}{2}.$
  As an additional application, we show that if $X$ is an $(r+1)$-partite $r$-dimensional simplicial complex on vertex set $V$, and $1\le k\le f_{r-1}(X)$, then \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le \sum_{i=1}^k \left|\{v\in V:\, \text{deg}^{(r)}_X(v)\ge i\}\right|. \] This resolves a special case of a conjecture of Duval and Reiner, which states that the above inequality holds for all simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>The canonical form, scissors congruence and adjoint degrees of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical form $\Omega$ as a valuation in the context of scissors congruence for polytopes. We identify the degree of its numerator - the adjoint polynomial $\operatorname{adj}_P$ - as an important invariant in this context. More precisely, for a polytope $P$ we define the degree drop that measures how much smaller than expected the degree of the adjoint polynomial of $P$ is. We show that this drop behaves well under various operations, such as decompositions, restrictions to faces, projections, products and Minkowski sums. Next we define the reduced canonical form $\Omega_0$ and show that it is a translation-invariant 1-homogeneous valuation on polytopes that vanishes if and only if $P$ has positive degree drop. Using it we can prove that zonotopes can be characterized as the $d$-polytopes that have maximal possible degree drop $d-1$. We obtain a decomposition formula for $\Omega_0$ that expresses it as a sum of edge-local quantities of $P$. Finally, we discuss valuations $\Omega_s$ that can distinguish higher values of the degree drop.</description>

      <title>Non-Rascoe partitions and a rank parity function associated to the Rogers-Ramanujan partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generating function of the excess number of Rogers-Ramanujan partitions with odd rank over those with even rank, and, using combinatorial and analytical techniques, show that this generating function is closely connected with an interesting class of restricted partitions, namely, partitions into distinct parts where the number of parts is not a part. We derive arithmetic properties of the number of such partitions and conjecture an interesting mod $4$ congruence. Generalizations of most of these results in a parameter $\ell$ are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new sums-of-tails identity involving two parameters $b$ and $d$ is obtained and is used to derive more results of similar type. One of Ramanujan's sums-of-tails identities from the Lost Notebook is shown to be a special case of our result. In the course of deriving Ramanujan's identity, we obtain a new result of combinatorial significance. Two new representations for an infinite series associated to a mock theta function are derived. Also, we give an application of an identity of Andrews and Onofri.</description>

      <title>Unimodality and Cluster Algebras from Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the rank polynomial of the lattice of order ideals of a loop fence poset is unimodal. These posets arise as the in the lattice of good matchings of loop graphs associated with notched arcs. Equivalently, such polynomials can be obtained by evaluating all coefficient variables in an F-polynomial at a single variable q. We also conclude that the rank polynomial of any tagged arc, whether plain or notched, is not only unimodal but also satisfies a symmetry condition known as almost interlacing. Furthermore, when the lamination consists of a single curve, the cluster expansion, evaluated by setting all cluster variables to 1 and all coefficient variables to q, is also unimodal. We conjecture that polynomials in this case are log-concave.</description>

      <title>Treedepth and 2-treedepth in graphs with no long induced paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huynh, Joret, Micek, Seweryn, and Wollan (Combinatorica, 2022) introduced a graph parameter, later referred to as 2-treedepth and denoted $\mathrm{td}_2(\cdot)$. The parameter is the natural 2-connected version of treedepth. For every graph, 2-treedepth is at most the treedepth but can be much smaller: long paths have arbitrary treedepth but 2-treedepth equal to 2. We prove a converse, showing that every graph $G$ with no induced path on $t$ vertices has treedepth less than $2 \cdot t^{\mathrm{td}_2(G)-1}$. This bound is best possible as a function of $t$ up to a multiplicative constant.
  Additionally, we give asymptotically tight bounds for the problem of forcing long induced paths in graphs with long paths and bounded 2-treedepth or bounded pathwidth. The latter result answers a question of Hilaire and Raymond (E-JC, 2024).</description>

      <title>Distance restricted matching extensions in regular non-bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ and $r$ be integers with $m \ge r \ge 3$ and let $G$ be an $r$-regular graph of even order. Let $M$ be a matching in $G$ of size $m$ such that each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $3$. In 2023, Aldred et al. proved that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr-r+1)$-edge-connected and $G$ is bipartite, then there exists a perfect matching of $G$ containing $M$. In this paper, we present non-bipartite analogues of Aldred et al.'s theorem. An odd ear of $U \subseteq V(G)$ is a path of odd length whose ends lie in $U$ but whose internal vertices do not, or a cycle of odd length having exactly one vertex in $U$. Our first result shows that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr - m +1)$-edge-connected and there exist $mr - \left\lceil \frac{r}{2} \right\rceil + 1$ edge-disjoint odd ears of $V(M)$, then $M$ can be extended to a perfect matching of $G$. We further show that if $G$ contains $mr-r+1$ edge-disjoint odd ears of $V(M)$ and no cyclic edge cut in $G$ of size less than $(2m-1)(r-1)$ separates an odd cycle from another cycle, then $M$ can still be extended to a perfect matching. The second result extends Aldred et al.'s theorem to non-bipartite graphs in the case $r \ge 4$, and in the case when $r = 3$ and each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $5$. It is also shown that the above results hold when $m \le r - 1$, without assuming the distance condition on $M$.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Trees with Degree Sequence-Based Topological Indices on Specialized Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the investigates Adriatic indices, specifically the sum lordeg index where it defined as $SL(G) = \sum_{u \in V(G)} \deg_G(u) \sqrt{\ln \deg_G(u)}$ and the variable sum exdeg index $SEI_a(G)$ for $a&gt;0$, $a\neq 1$. We present several sharp bounds and characterizations of these and related topological indices on specialized graph classes, including regular graphs, thorny graphs, and chemical trees. Using the strict convexity of function $f$, inequalities for degree-based graph invariants $H_f(T)$ are derived under structural constraints on trees such as branching vertices and maximum degree. Examples on caterpillar trees illustrate the computation of indices like $^{m}M_2(G)$, $F(G)$, $M_2(G)$, and others, revealing the interplay between degree sequences and index values. Additionally, upper and lower bounds on the Sombor index $SO(G^*)$ of thorny graphs $G^*$ are established as \[ \operatorname{SO} \leqslant \sum_{uv\in E(G)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\deg_{G}(u)^2+\deg_{G}(v)^2}+\deg_{G}(u)+\deg_{G}(v)}, \]
  including criteria for equality, with implications for regular and thorn-regular graphs. The treatment includes detailed formulas, constructive examples, and inequalities critical for understanding the relationship between graph topology and vertex-degree-based descriptors.</description>

      <title>A short combinatorial proof of Di Francesco's conjecture on Aztec triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Di Francesco conjectured in 2021 that the number of domino tilings of a certain family of regions -- called Aztec triangles -- on the square lattice is given by a product formula reminiscent of the one giving the number of alternating sign matrices. This turned out to be a real challenge to prove without the use of computers -- each of the two existing proofs (one due to Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser, the other to Corteel, Huang and Krattenthaler) relies on substantial computer calculations which would be hard to check directly. In this paper we present a short combinatorial proof that relies on the second author's factorization theorem and complementation theorem for perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Extendability of $1$-decomposable complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Simon (1994) states that any pure $d$-dimensional shellable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, the $d$-skeleton of the $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex, by attaching one facet at a time while maintaining shellability.
  The notion of $k$-decomposability for simplicial complexes, which generalizes shellability, was introduced by Provan and Billera (1980). Coleman, Dochtermann, Geist, and Oh (2022) showed that any pure $d$-dimensional $0$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can similarly be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while preserving $0$-decomposability.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous question for $1$-decomposable complexes. We prove a slightly relaxed version: any pure $d$-dimensional $1$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n + d - 3}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while maintaining $1$-decomposability.</description>

      <title>Millions of inequivalent quadratic APN functions in eight variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The only known example of an almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutation in even dimension was obtained by applying CCZ-equivalence to a specific quadratic APN function. Motivated by this result, there have been numerous recent attempts to construct new quadratic APN functions. Currently, 32,892 quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 are known and two recent conjectures address their possible total number. The first, proposed by Y. Yu and L. Perrin (Cryptogr. Commun. 14(6): 1359-1369, 2022), suggests that there are more than 50,000 such functions. The second, by A. Polujan and A. Pott (Proc. 7th Int. Workshop on Boolean Functions and Their Applications, 2022), argues that their number exceeds that of inequivalent quadratic (8,4)-bent functions, which is 92,515. We computationally construct 3,775,599 inequivalent quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 and estimate the total number to be about 6 million.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the seminal work of Andr\'e-Louis Cholesky -- whose contributions remain crucial even after more than a century in broader sciences -- Cooper, Hanna and Whitlatch (2024) developed a theory of positive matrices over finite fields, and Khare and Vishwakarma (2025) described a general Cholesky factorization for a family of the dense cone of Hermitian matrices over real/complex fields, whose leading principal minors (LPM) are nonzero. Building on this, we develop a parallel theory within the finite field setting. Specifically (i) we extend the general Cholesky factorization to the LPM cone over finite fields which has asymptomatic density $1$. We show that (ii) this factorization is compatible with the entrywise Frobenius map, recently studied in the context of positivity preservers by Guillot, Gupta, Vishwakarma, and Yip [J. Algebra, 2025]. We also (iii) leverage the Cholesky-structures to define meaningful group operations on the matrix cone, and as an application (iv) enumerate sub-cones of LPM matrices using our general Cholesky factorizations.</description>

      <title>New formulas for Macdonald polynomials via the multispecies exclusion and zero range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe some recently discovered connections between one-dimensional interacting particle models and Macdonald polynomials. The first such model is the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a ring, linked to the symmetric Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its partition function. Through this connection, a new formula was found for $P_{\lambda}$ by generalizing multiline queues, which were introduced by Martin in 2018 to compute stationary probabilities of the ASEP. The second particle model is the multispecies totally asymmetric zero range process (TAZRP) on a ring, which was very recently found to have an analogous connection to the modified Macdonald polynomial $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its partition function. This discovery coincided with a new formula for $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}$, this time in terms of tableaux with a queue inversion statistic, which also compute stationary probabilities of the TAZRP. We explain the plethystic relationship between multiline queues and queue inversion tableaux, and along the way, derive a new formula for $P_{\lambda}$ using the queue inversion statistic. This plethystic correspondence is closely related to fusion in the setting of integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braid varieties parametrize linear configurations of flags with transversality conditions dictated by positive braids. They include and generalize reduced double Bruhat cells, positroid varieties, open Bott-Samelson varieties, and Richardson varieties, among others. Recently, two cluster algebra structures were independently constructed in the coordinate rings of braid varieties: one using weaves and the other using Deodhar geometry. The main result of the article is that these two cluster algebras coincide. More generally, our comparative study matches the different concepts and results from each approach to the other, both on the combinatorial and algebraic geometric aspects.</description>

      <title>Elementary Proofs of Recent Congruences for Overpartitions Wherein Non-Overlined Parts are Not Divisible by 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$ as the number of overpartitions of $n$ in which non-overlined parts are not divisible by $l$. In a recent work, Nath, Saikia, and the second author established several families of congruences for $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$, with particular focus on the cases $l=6$ and $l=8$. In the concluding remarks of their paper, they conjectured that $\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ satisfies an infinite family of congruences modulo $128$. In this paper, we confirm their conjectures using elementary methods. Additionally, we provide elementary proofs of two congruences for $\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ previously proven via the machinery of modular forms by Alanazi, Munagi, and Saikia.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Jin, Liu, and Xia \cite{JLX} presented some modulo 4 congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$, the number of smallest parts in the overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest part is even and is not overlined. In this paper, we extend the list of such congruences in two directions. First, we prove some new individual congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$. Then, we provide a number of infinite families of Ramanujan-like congruences satisfied by $\overline{spt2}(n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplication of a sparse matrix with another (dense or sparse) matrix is a fundamental operation that captures the computational patterns of many data science applications, including but not limited to graph algorithms, sparsely connected neural networks, graph neural networks, clustering, and many-to-many comparisons of biological sequencing data.
  In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich application space including machine learning, computational biology and chemistry, graph algorithms, and scientific computing.</description>

Abstract: Initiated by Mulmuley, Vazirani, and Vazirani (1987), many algebraic algorithms have been developed for matching and related problems. In this paper, we review basic facts and discuss possible improvements with the aid of fast computation of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. In particular, we show that the so-called exact matching problem can be solved with high probability in asymptotically the same time order as matrix multiplication. We also discuss its extension to the linear matroid parity problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distribution over instances of a sampling problem is said to exhibit transport disorder chaos if perturbing the instance by a small amount of random noise dramatically changes the stationary distribution (in Wasserstein distance). Seeking to provide evidence that some sampling tasks are hard on average, a recent line of work has demonstrated that disorder chaos is sufficient to rule out "stable" sampling algorithms, such as gradient methods and some diffusion processes.
  We demonstrate that disorder chaos does not preclude polynomial-time sampling by canonical algorithms in canonical models. We show that with high probability over a random graph $\boldsymbol{G} \sim G(n,1/2)$: (1) the hardcore model (at fugacity $\lambda = 1$) on $\boldsymbol{G}$ exhibits disorder chaos, and (2) Glauber dynamics run for $O(n)$ time can approximately sample from the hardcore model on $\boldsymbol{G}$ (in Wasserstein distance).</description>

      <title>One-weight codes in the sum-rank metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form a highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite geometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct classes. First, we introduce and classify \emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general \emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three, we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain fields.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Progressions Inside Sets of Large Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we connect Sobolev estimates in the context of polynomial averages e.g. \[ \| \int_0^1 \prod_{k=1}^m f_k(x-t^k) \|_{1} \leq \text{Const} \cdot 2^{-\text{const} \cdot l} \prod_{i=1}^m \| f_k \|_m \] whenever some $f_i$ vanishes on $\{ |\xi| \leq 2^l \}$ to the existence of polynomial progressions inside of sets of sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, in analogy with work of Peluse in the discrete context. Our strongest (unconditional) result builds off deep work of Hu-Lie is as follows: suppose that $\mathcal{P} = \{P_1,P_2,P_3\}$ vanish at the origin at different rates, and that $E \subset [0,1]$ has sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, \[ 1 - \text{const}(\mathcal{P}) &lt; \text{dim}_H(E) &lt; 1.\] Then $E$ contains a non-trivial polynomial progression of the form \[ \{ x , x - P_1(t), x - P_2(t), x - P_3(t) \} \subset E, \; \; \; t \neq 0. \]</description>

      <title>Growth of bilinear maps III: Decidability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following notion of growth rate can be seen as a generalization of joint spectral radius: Given a bilinear map $*:\mathbb R^d\times\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R^d$ with nonnegative coefficients and a nonnegative vector $s\in\mathbb R^d$, denote by $g(n)$ the largest possible entry of a vector obtained by combining $n$ instances of $s$ using $n-1$ applications of $*$. Let $\lambda$ denote the growth rate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{g(n)}$. Rosenfeld showed that the problem of checking $\lambda\le 1$ is undecidable by reducing the problem of joint spectral radius.
  In this article, we provide a simpler reduction using the observation that matrix multiplication is actually a bilinear map. Moreover, we extend the reduction to show that checking $\lambda\le 1$ is still undecidable even if $s$ is positive. If there is no restriction on the signs, we can also show that the problem of checking if the system can produce a zero vector is undecidable by reducing the problem of checking the mortality of a pair of matrices. This answers a question asked by Rosenfeld. Beside that, we confirm a remark of Rosenfeld that the problem does not become harder when we introduce more bilinear maps and more starting vectors.
  It is known that if the vector $s$ is strictly positive, then the limit superior $\lambda$ is actually a limit. However, we show that when $s$ is only nonnegative, the problem of checking the existence of the limit is undecidable. This also answers a question asked by Rosenfeld.
  We provide a formula for the growth rate $\lambda$ in terms of the diagonals of matrices corresponding to a special structure called ``linear pattern''. A condition is given so that the limit $\lambda$ exists. This actually provides a simpler proof for the existence of the limit $\lambda$ when $s&gt;0$. An important corollary of the formula is the computability of the growth rate,....</description>

      <title>Distance-Restricted Firefighting on Finite Graphs</title>

Abstract: In the classic version of the game of firefighter, on the first turn a fire breaks out on a vertex in a graph $G$ and then $b$ firefighters protect $b$ vertices. On each subsequent turn, the fire spreads to the collective unburned neighbourhood of all the burning vertices and the firefighters again protect $b$ vertices. Once a vertex has been burned or protected it remains that way for the rest of the game. In \textit{distance-restricted firefighting} the firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed distance $d$ and they may or may not be permitted to move through burning vertices. In this paper we establish the NP-completeness of the distance-restricted versions of {\sc $b$-Firefighter} and present an integer program for computing the exact value. We also discuss some interesting properties of the \textit{Expected Damage} function.</description>

      <title>Balanced-chromatic number and Hadwiger-like conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by different characterizations of planar graphs and the 4-Color Theorem, several structural results concerning graphs of high chromatic number have been obtained. Toward strengthening some of these results, we consider the \emph{balanced chromatic number}, $\chi_b(\hat{G})$, of a signed graph $\hat{G}$. This is the minimum number of parts into which the vertices of a signed graph can be partitioned so that none of the parts induces a negative cycle. This extends the notion of the chromatic number of a graph since $\chi(G)=\chi_b(\tilde{G})$, where $\tilde{G}$ denotes the signed graph obtained from~$G$ by replacing each edge with a pair of (parallel) positive and negative edges. We introduce a signed version of Hadwiger's conjecture as follows.
  Conjecture: If a signed graph $\hat{G}$ has no negative loop and no $\tilde{K_t}$-minor, then its balanced chromatic number is at most $t-1$.
  We prove that this conjecture is, in fact, equivalent to Hadwiger's conjecture and show its relation to the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture.
  Motivated by these results, we also consider the relation between subdivisions and balanced chromatic number. We prove that if $(G, \sigma)$ has no negative loop and no $\tilde{K_t}$-subdivision, then it admits a balanced $\frac{79}{2}t^2$-coloring. This qualitatively generalizes a result of Kawarabayashi (2013) on totally odd subdivisions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic operators for non-attacking tableaux and a compact formula for the symmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new tableaux formula for the symmetric Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ that has considerably fewer terms and simpler weights than previously existing formulas. Our formula is a sum over certain sorted non-attacking tableaux, weighted by the queue inversion statistic quinv. The quinv statistic originates from a formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ due to Ayyer, Martin, and the author (2022), and is naturally related to the dynamics of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a circle.
  We prove our results by introducing probabilistic operators that act on non-attacking tableaux to generate a set of tableaux whose weighted sum equals $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$. These operators are a modification of the inversion flip operators of Loehr and Niese (2012), which yield an involution on tableaux that preserves the major index statistic, but fails to preserve the non-attacking condition. Our tableaux are in bijection with the multiline queues introduced by Martin (2020), allowing us to derive an alternative multiline queue formula for $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$. Finally, our formula recovers an alternative formula for the Jack polynomials $J_{\lambda}(X;\alpha)$ due to Knop and Sahi (1996) using the same queue inversion statistic.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic concavity of bimatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bimatroid is a matroid-like generalization of the collection of regular minors of a matrix. In this article, we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials to study the logarithmic concavity of natural sequences associated to bimatroids. Bimatroids can be used to characterize morphisms of matroids and this observation (originally due to Kung) allows us to prove a weak version of logarithmic concavity of the number of bases of a morphism of matroids. This is weaker than the original result by Eur and Huh; it nevertheless provides us with a new perspective on Mason's log-concavity conjecture for independent sets of matroids. We finally show that for realizable bimatroids, the regular minor polynomial is a volume polynomial. Applied to morphisms of matroids, this shows that the weak basis generating polynomial of a morphism is a volume polynomial; this confirms a conjecture of Eur--Huh for morphisms of nullity $\leq 1$ and gives an algebro-geometric explanation for Mason's log-concavity conjecture in the realizable case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the permutation analogue of Penney's game for words. Two players, in order, each choose a permutation of length $k\ge3$; then a sequence of independent random values from a continuous distribution is generated, until the relative order of the last $k$ numbers coincides with one of the chosen permutations, making that player the winner.
  We compute the winning probabilities for all pairs of permutations of length 3 and some pairs of length 4, showing that, as in the original version for words, the game is non-transitive. Our proofs introduce new bijections for consecutive patterns in permutations. We also give some formulas to compute the winning probabilities more generally, and conjecture a winning strategy for the second player when $k$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>On mutually $\mu$-intersecting quasi-Hermitian varieties with some applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal W$ be a non-empty set of points of a finite Desarguesian projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$. A collection of varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ is \emph{mutually $\mu$-intersecting (relatively to $\mathcal W$)} if its elements meet all $\mathcal W$ in the same number of points and pairwise intersect in $\mathcal W$ in exactly $\mu$-points. Here we construct a new family of mutually $\mu$-intersecting algebraic varieties by using certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q^2)$ where $q$ is any prime power. With the help of these quasi-Hermitian varieties we provide a new construction of $5$-dimensional MDS codes over ${\mathbb F}_q$ as well as an infinite family of simple orthogonal arrays $OA(q^{2n-1},q^{2n-2},q,2)$ of index $\mu=q^{2n-3}$.</description>

Abstract: We extend reconstruction methods for phylogenetic trees to ultrametrics of arbitrary matroids and study the stability of these data analysis methods in the combinatorial spirit of Andreas Dress. In particular, we generalize Atteson's work on the safety radius of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, as well as Gascuel and Steel's work on the stochastic safety radius, to arbitrary matroids. We also show that although the tropical Fermat-Weber points of an $M$-ultrametric sample are generally not contained in the space of $M$-ultrametrics, the intersection between the Fermat-Weber set and the space of $M$-ultrametrics is always non-empty.</description>

      <title>Adjacency spectral radius and H-factors in 1-binding graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph, and let $H:V(G)\longrightarrow\{\{1\},\{0,2\}\}$ be a set-valued function. Hence, $H(v)$ equals $\{1\}$ or $\{0,2\}$ for any $v\in V(G)$. We let $$ H^{-1}(1)=\{v: v\in V(G) \ \mbox{and} \ H(v)=1\}. $$ An $H$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that $d_F(v)\in H(v)$ for each $v\in V(G)$. Lu and Kano showed a characterization for the existence of an $H$-factor in a graph [Characterization of 1-tough graphs using factors, Discrete Math. 343 (2020) 111901]. Let $A(G)$ and $\rho(G)$ denote the adjacency matrix and the adjacency spectral radius of $G$, respectively. By using Lu and Kano's result, we pose a sufficient condition with respect to the adjacency spectral radius to guarantee the existence of an $H$-factor in a 1-binding graph. In this paper, we prove that if a connected 1-binding graph $G$ of order $n\geq11$ satisfies $\rho(G)\geq\rho(K_1\vee(K_{n-4}\cup K_2\cup K_1))$, then $G$ has an $H$-factor for each $H:V(G)\longrightarrow\{\{1\},\{0,2\}\}$ with $H^{-1}(1)$ even, unless $G=K_1\vee(K_{n-4}\cup K_2\cup K_1)$.</description>

Abstract: We define a range of new coarse geometric invariants based on various graph-theoretic measures of complexity for finite graphs, including: treewidth, pathwidth, cutwidth and bandwidth. We prove that, for bounded degree graphs, these invariants can be used to define functions which satisfy a strong monotonicity property, namely they are monotonically non-decreasing with respect to a large-scale geometric generalisation of graph inclusion, and as such have potential applications in coarse geometry and geometric group theory. On the graph-theoretic side, we prove asymptotically optimal bounds on most of the above widths for the family of all finite subgraphs of any bounded degree graph whose separation profile is known to be of the form $r^a\log(r)^b$ for some $a&gt;0$. This large class includes Diestel-Leader graphs, all Cayley graphs of non-virtually cyclic polycyclic groups, uniform lattices in almost all connected unimodular Lie groups, and many hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in algebraic geometry, an effective divisor class on a vertex-weighted graph is called special if also its residual class is effective. We study the question, when this is true already on the level of divisors; that is, when there exists an effective divisor in the class whose residual is effective as well, so called uniform divisors. We show that uniform divisors exist in any special class on graphs with all vertex weights non-zero; we show that in general a representative can be chosen, whose value is off by at most one on vertices of weight zero. To prove this, we generalize the notion of divisors that are reduced with respect to a vertex to divisors that are reduced with respect to a set of vertices. We compare this notion to a previous generalization due to Luo. As an application, we obtain a new algorithm to determine whether a divisor class is effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance 1. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>
