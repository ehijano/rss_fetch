      <title>From the self-dual Yang-Mills equation to the Fokas-Lenells equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reduction from the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equation to the unreduced Fokas-Lenells (FL) system is described in this paper. It has been known that the SDYM equation can be formulated from the Cauchy matrix schemes of the matrix Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy. We show that the reduction can be realized in these two Cauchy matrix schemes, respectively. Each scheme allows us to construct solutions for the unreduced FL system. We prove that these solutions obtained from different schemes are equivalent under certain reflection transformation of coordinates. Using conjugate reduction we obtain solutions of the FL equation. The paper adds an important example to Ward's conjecture on the reductions of the SDYM equation. It also indicates the Cauchy matrix structures of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge transport in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of anomalous charge transport in the quantum sine--Gordon model. Employing the framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we compute Drude weights and Onsager matrices across a wide range of coupling strengths to quantify ballistic and diffusive transport, respectively. We find that charge transport is predominantly diffusive at accessible timescales, indicated by the corresponding Onsager matrix significantly exceeding the Drude weight -- contrary to most integrable models where transport is primarily ballistic. Reducing the Onsager matrix to a few key two-particle scattering processes enables us to efficiently examine transport in both low- and high-temperature limits. The charge transport is dictated by non-diagonal scattering of the internal charge degree of freedom: At particular values of the coupling strength with diagonal, diffusive effects amount to merely subleading corrections. However, at couplings approaching these points, the charge Onsager matrix and corresponding diffusive time-scale diverge. Our findings relate to similar transport anomalies in XXZ spin chains, offering insights through their shared Bethe Ansatz structures.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many instances, in subjects such as biology, where a population number, or related quantity, changes in discrete time. For the population number at time $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, written $x_{n}$, we show that some exactly soluble cases of $x_{n}$ can be related to a different problem, where the number of individuals changes in continuous time. With $x(t)$ the population number at continuous time $t\geq0$, the relation is that $x(t=n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we call the two models 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. Cases of equivalence can be found for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous equations.
  A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation of the equivalent problem, allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations, thereby exposing structural similarities and differences of the two problems.
  When the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified, e.g., by the introduction of time inhomogeneity, so $x_{n}$ has no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate equivalent continuous time solution, $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$. We find that $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t=n)$ can yield a good approximation to $x_{n}$ because $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$ encapsulates much of the behaviour of $x_{n}$.
  We note that some discrete time problems may have solutions with an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n\rightarrow n+1$. This occurs with the Fibonacci numbers. We find that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is by becoming complex; it no longer represents a simple interpolation.</description>

      <title>On an integrable discretization of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates and the associated Yang-Baxter map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <title>Magic Billiards: the Case of Elliptical Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel concept of magic billiards, which can be seen as an umbrella, unifying several well-known generalisations of mathematical billiards. We analyse properties of magic billiards in the case of elliptical boundaries. We provide explicit conditions for periodicity in algebro-geometric, analytic, and polynomial forms. A topological description of those billiards is given using Fomenko graphs.</description>

      <title>Representation of Linear Waves in Inhomogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article explores the acoustic equations in inhomogeneous media and the linearized shallow water equations.
  Two methods for integrating these equations are proposed. The first method is based on the of the Laplace cascade method, while the second involves reducing two-dimensional and three-dimensional models to the wave equation. In the case of plane waves, solutions to some equations depending on two arbitrary functions are obtained. In the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, equations that can be reduced to equations with constant coefficients are found.</description>

      <title>Euler's original derivation of elastica equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elaborate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>
