      <title>A Greedy Algorithm for Low-Crossing Partitions for General Set Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial partitions are a fundamental structure in computational geometry, as they form the basis of optimal data structures for range searching and several related problems. Current algorithms are built on very specific spatial partitioning tools tailored for certain geometric cases. This severely limits their applicability to general set systems. In this work, we propose a simple greedy heuristic for constructing simplicial partitions of any set system. We present a thorough empirical evaluation of its behavior on a variety of geometric and non-geometric set systems, showing that it performs well on most instances. Implementation of these algorithms is available on Github.</description>

      <title>Computational Geometry with Probabilistically Noisy Primitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much prior work has been done on designing computational geometry algorithms that handle input degeneracies, data imprecision, and arithmetic round-off errors. We take a new approach, inspired by the noisy sorting literature, and study computational geometry algorithms subject to noisy Boolean primitive operations in which, e.g., the comparison "is point q above line L?" returns the wrong answer with some fixed probability. We propose a novel technique called path-guided pushdown random walks that generalizes the results of noisy sorting. We apply this technique to solve point-location, plane-sweep, convex hulls in 2D and 3D, dynamic 2D convex hulls, and Delaunay triangulations for noisy primitives in optimal time with high probability.</description>

      <title>Ortho-unit polygons can be guarded with at most $\lfloor \frac{n-4}{8} \rfloor$ guards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthogonal polygon is called an ortho-unit polygon if its vertices have integer coordinates, and all of its edges have length one. In this paper we prove that any ortho-unit polygon with $n \geq 12$ vertices can be guarded with at most $\lfloor \frac{n-4}{8} \rfloor$ guards, which is a tight bound.</description>

      <title>HyperSteiner: Computing Heuristic Hyperbolic Steiner Minimal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose HyperSteiner -- an efficient heuristic algorithm for computing Steiner minimal trees in the hyperbolic space. HyperSteiner extends the Euclidean Smith-Lee-Liebman algorithm, which is grounded in a divide-and-conquer approach involving the Delaunay triangulation. The central idea is rephrasing Steiner tree problems with three terminals as a system of equations in the Klein-Beltrami model. Motivated by the fact that hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for representing hierarchies, we explore applications to hierarchy discovery in data. Results show that HyperSteiner infers more realistic hierarchies than the Minimum Spanning Tree and is more scalable to large datasets than Neighbor Joining.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Extracting Manifold Information from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kernel based method is proposed for the construction of signature (defining) functions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The subsets can range from full dimensional manifolds (open subsets) to point clouds (a finite number of points) and include bounded smooth manifolds of any codimension. The interpolation and analysis of point clouds are the main application. Two extreme cases in terms of regularity are considered, where the data set is interpolated by an analytic surface, at the one extreme, and by a H\"older continuous surface, at the other. The signature function can be computed as a linear combination of translated kernels, the coefficients of which are the solution of a finite dimensional linear problem. Once it is obtained, it can be used to estimate the dimension as well as the normal and the curvatures of the interpolated surface. The method is global and does not require explicit knowledge of local neighborhoods or any other structure present in the data set. It admits a variational formulation with a natural ``regularized'' counterpart, that proves to be useful in dealing with data sets corrupted by numerical error or noise. The underlying analytical structure of the approach is presented in general before it is applied to the case of point clouds.</description>
