      <title>Operationalising AI governance through ethics-based auditing: An industry case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethics based auditing (EBA) is a structured process whereby an entitys past or present behaviour is assessed for consistency with moral principles or norms. Recently, EBA has attracted much attention as a governance mechanism that may bridge the gap between principles and practice in AI ethics. However, important aspects of EBA (such as the feasibility and effectiveness of different auditing procedures) have yet to be substantiated by empirical research. In this article, we address this knowledge gap by providing insights from a longitudinal industry case study. Over 12 months, we observed and analysed the internal activities of AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company, as it prepared for and underwent an ethics-based AI audit. While previous literature concerning EBA has focused on proposing evaluation metrics or visualisation techniques, our findings suggest that the main difficulties large multinational organisations face when conducting EBA mirror classical governance challenges. These include ensuring harmonised standards across decentralised organisations, demarcating the scope of the audit, driving internal communication and change management, and measuring actual outcomes. The case study presented in this article contributes to the existing literature by providing a detailed description of the organisational context in which EBA procedures must be integrated to be feasible and effective.</description>

      <title>AI and Social Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we sketch a programme for AI driven social theory. We begin by defining what we mean by artificial intelligence (AI) in this context. We then lay out our model for how AI based models can draw on the growing availability of digital data to help test the validity of different social theories based on their predictive power. In doing so, we use the work of Randall Collins and his state breakdown model to exemplify that, already today, AI based models can help synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources, reason about the world, and apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way. However, we also find that AI driven social theory remains subject to a range of practical, technical, and epistemological limitations. Most critically, existing AI systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful. These are (1) semanticization, i.e., the ability to develop and operationalize verbal concepts to represent machine-manipulable knowledge, (2) transferability, i.e., the ability to transfer what has been learned in one context to another, and (3) generativity, i.e., the ability to independently create and improve on concepts and models. We argue that if the gaps identified here are addressed by further research, there is no reason why, in the future, the most advanced programme in social theory should not be led by AI-driven cumulative advances.</description>

      <title>Auditing of AI: Legal, Ethical and Technical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI auditing is a rapidly growing field of research and practice. This review article, which doubles as an editorial to Digital Societys topical collection on Auditing of AI, provides an overview of previous work in the field. Three key points emerge from the review. First, contemporary attempts to audit AI systems have much to learn from how audits have historically been structured and conducted in areas like financial accounting, safety engineering and the social sciences. Second, both policymakers and technology providers have an interest in promoting auditing as an AI governance mechanism. Academic researchers can thus fill an important role by studying the feasibility and effectiveness of different AI auditing procedures. Third, AI auditing is an inherently multidisciplinary undertaking, to which substantial contributions have been made by computer scientists and engineers as well as social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and industry practitioners. Reflecting this diversity of perspectives, different approaches to AI auditing have different affordances and constraints. Specifically, a distinction can be made between technology-oriented audits, which focus on the properties and capabilities of AI systems, and process oriented audits, which focus on technology providers governance structures and quality management systems. The next step in the evolution of auditing as an AI governance mechanism, this article concludes, should be the interlinking of these available (and complementary) approaches into structured and holistic procedures to audit not only how AI systems are designed and used but also how they impact users, societies and the natural environment in applied settings over time.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via ChatGPT to Protect Children from Age-Inappropriate Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile applications (Apps) could expose children to inappropriate themes such as sexual content, violence, and drug use. Maturity rating offers a quick and effective method for potential users, particularly guardians, to assess the maturity levels of apps. Determining accurate maturity ratings for mobile apps is essential to protect children's health in today's saturated digital marketplace. Existing approaches to maturity rating are either inaccurate (e.g., self-reported rating by developers) or costly (e.g., manual examination). In the literature, there are few text-mining-based approaches to maturity rating. However, each app typically involves multiple modalities, namely app description in the text, and screenshots in the image. In this paper, we present a framework for determining app maturity levels that utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4 Vision. Powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our framework systematically leverages ChatGPT-4 to process multimodal app data (i.e., textual descriptions and screenshots) and guide the MLLM model through a step-by-step reasoning pathway from initial content analysis to final maturity rating determination. As a result, through explicitly incorporating CoT reasoning, our framework enables ChatGPT to understand better and apply maturity policies to facilitate maturity rating. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms all baseline models and other fusion strategies.</description>

      <title>Information Seeking and Communication among International Students on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on information-seeking behaviors among international students, with a focus on the r/f1visa subreddit. Our study indicates a considerable rise in the number of users posting more than one question during the pandemic. Those asking recurring questions demonstrate more active involvement in communication, suggesting a continuous pursuit of knowledge. Furthermore, the thematic focus has shifted from questions about jobs before COVID-19 to concerns about finances, school preparations, and taxes during COVID-19. These findings carry implications for support policymaking, highlighting the importance of delivering timely and relevant information to meet the evolving needs of international students. To enhance international students' understanding and navigation of this dynamic environment, future research in this field is necessary.</description>

      <title>A Matter of Mindset? Features and Processes of Newsroom-based Corporate Communication in Times of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many companies adopt the corporate newsroom model to streamline their corporate communication. This article addresses why and how corporate newsrooms transform corporate communication following the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It draws on original data from 13 semi-structured interviews with executive communication experts in large Swiss companies which use corporate newsrooms. Interviews show that corporate newsrooms serve as an organisational (rather than spatial) coordination body for topic-oriented and agile corporate communication. To enable their functionality, it is crucial to find the right balance between optimising and stabilising communication structures. Newsrooms actively adopt AI both to facilitate routine tasks and enable more innovative applications, such as living data archives and channel translations. Interviews also highlight an urgent need for AI regulation for corporate communication. The article's findings provide important insights into the practical challenges and coping strategies for establishing and managing corporate newsrooms and how newsrooms can be transformed by AI.</description>

      <title>Synthetic data: How could it be used for infectious disease research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last three to five years, it has become possible to generate machine learning synthetic data for healthcare-related uses. However, concerns have been raised about potential negative factors associated with the possibilities of artificial dataset generation. These include the potential misuse of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in fields such as cybercrime, the use of deepfakes and fake news to deceive or manipulate, and displacement of human jobs across various market sectors.
  Here, we consider both current and future positive advances and possibilities with synthetic datasets. Synthetic data offers significant benefits, particularly in data privacy, research, in balancing datasets and reducing bias in machine learning models. Generative AI is an artificial intelligence genre capable of creating text, images, video or other data using generative models. The recent explosion of interest in GenAI was heralded by the invention and speedy move to use of large language models (LLM). These computational models are able to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks and are based on transformer architectures, which made an evolutionary leap from previous neural network architectures.
  Fuelled by the advent of improved GenAI techniques and wide scale usage, this is surely the time to consider how synthetic data can be used to advance infectious disease research. In this commentary we aim to create an overview of the current and future position of synthetic data in infectious disease research.</description>

      <title>Multi-person eye tracking for real-world scene perception in social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Previous research suggests that eye movements are highly influenced by task, setting, and social others; however, most eye tracking research is conducted in single-person, in-lab settings and is yet to be validated in multi-person, naturalistic contexts. One such prevalent real-world context is the collective viewing of a shared scene in social settings, for example, viewing a concert, film, lecture, sports, etc. Here, we apply mobile eye tracking in a real-world multi-person setup and develop a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data. We tested our proposed, open-source system while participants (N=60) watched a live concert and a documentary film screening during a public event. We tackled challenges related to networking bandwidth requirements, real-time monitoring, and gaze projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. Our system achieves precise time synchronisation and accurate gaze projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Further, to illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data, we introduce and evaluate novel analysis metrics and visualisations. Overall, our approach contributes to the development and application of versatile multi-person eye tracking systems in real-world social settings. This advancement enables insight into collaborative behaviour, group dynamics, and social interaction, with high ecological validity. Moreover, it paves the path for innovative, interactive tools that promote collaboration and coordination in social contexts.</description>

      <title>SideSeeing: A multimodal dataset and collection of tools for sidewalk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SideSeeing, a novel initiative that provides tools and datasets for assessing the built environment. We present a framework for street-level data acquisition, loading, and analysis. Using the framework, we collected a novel dataset that integrates synchronized video footaged captured from chest-mounted mobile devices with sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and GPS). Each data sample represents a path traversed by a user filming sidewalks near hospitals in Brazil and the USA. The dataset encompasses three hours of content covering 12 kilometers around nine hospitals, and includes 325,000 video frames with corresponding sensor data. Additionally, we present a novel 68-element taxonomy specifically created for sidewalk scene identification. SideSeeing is a step towards a suite of tools that urban experts can use to perform in-depth sidewalk accessibility evaluations. SideSeeing data and tools are publicly available at https://sites.usp.br/sideseeing/.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes current research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to highlight the reasons for the dissent in echo chamber research on the existence, antecedents, and effects of the phenomenon. The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.
  Most of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.</description>

      <title>Teacher agency in the age of generative AI: towards a framework of hybrid intelligence for learning design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) is being used in education for different purposes. From the teachers' perspective, genAI can support activities such as learning design. However, there is a need to study the impact of genAI on the teachers' agency. While GenAI can support certain processes of idea generation and co-creation, GenAI has the potential to negatively affect professional agency due to teachers' limited power to (i) act, (ii) affect matters, and (iii) make decisions or choices, as well as the possibility to (iv) take a stance. Agency is identified in the learning sciences studies as being one of the factors in teachers' ability to trust AI. This paper aims to introduce a dual perspective. First, educational technology, as opposed to other computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools, has two distinctly different user groups and different user needs, in the form of learners and teachers, to cater for. Second, the design of educational technology often prioritises learner agency and engagement, thereby limiting the opportunities for teachers to influence the technology and take action. This study aims to analyse the way GenAI is influencing teachers' agency. After identifying the current limits of GenAI, a solution based on the combination of human intelligence and artificial intelligence through a hybrid intelligence approach is proposed. This combination opens up the discussion of a collaboration between teacher and genAI being able to open up new practices in learning design in which they HI support the extension of the teachers' activity.</description>

      <title>It Cannot Be Right If It Was Written by AI: On Lawyers' Preferences of Documents Perceived as Authored by an LLM vs a Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a future in which certain types of legal documents may be generated automatically. This has a great potential to streamline legal processes, lower the cost of legal services, and dramatically increase access to justice. While many researchers focus their efforts on proposing and evaluating LLM-based applications supporting tasks in the legal domain, there is a notable lack of investigations into how legal professionals perceive content if they believe it has been generated by an LLM. Yet, this is a critical point as over-reliance or unfounded skepticism may influence whether such documents bring about appropriate legal consequences. This study is the necessary analysis in the context of the ongoing transition towards mature generative AI systems. Specifically, we examined whether the perception of legal documents' by lawyers (n=75) varies based on their assumed origin (human-crafted vs AI-generated). The participants evaluated the documents focusing on their correctness and language quality. Our analysis revealed a clear preference for documents perceived as crafted by a human over those believed to be generated by AI. At the same time, most of the participants are expecting the future in which documents will be generated automatically. These findings could be leveraged by legal practitioners, policy makers and legislators to implement and adopt legal document generation technology responsibly, and to fuel the necessary discussions into how legal processes should be updated to reflect the recent technological developments.</description>

      <title>Divine LLaMAs: Bias, Stereotypes, Stigmatization, and Emotion Representation of Religion in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotions play important epistemological and cognitive roles in our lives, revealing our values and guiding our actions. Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines. However, unlike gender, which says little about our values, religion, as a socio-cultural system, prescribes a set of beliefs and values for its followers. Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that: Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped. Judaism and Islam are stigmatized -- the models' refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is discussed, it is often in the context of toxic language, perpetuating the perception of these religions as inherently toxic. This finding underscores the urgent need to address and rectify these biases. Our research underscores the crucial role emotions play in our lives and how our values influence them.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereotypes, particularly those that disproportionately affect marginalised communities. To understand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside descriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplexity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model's internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with various stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly instructed not to.</description>

      <title>Listen and Speak Fairly: A Study on Semantic Gender Bias in Speech Integrated Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Speech Integrated Large Language Models (SILLMs) combine large language models with speech perception to perform diverse tasks, such as emotion recognition to speaker verification, demonstrating universal audio understanding capability. However, these models may amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to biased access to information for marginalized groups. This work introduces a curated spoken bias evaluation toolkit and corresponding dataset. We evaluate gender bias in SILLMs across four semantic-related tasks: speech-to-text translation (STT), spoken coreference resolution (SCR), spoken sentence continuation (SSC), and spoken question answering (SQA). Our analysis reveals that bias levels are language-dependent and vary with different evaluation methods. Our findings emphasize the necessity of employing multiple approaches to comprehensively assess biases in SILLMs, providing insights for developing fairer SILLM systems.</description>
