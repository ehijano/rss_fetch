      <title>Exotic Quantum Phenomena in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene twisted at the angle of about 1.1{\deg} better known as magic angle, exhibits ultra-flat moir\'e superlattice bands that are a source of highly-tunable, exotic quantum phenomena. Such phenomena, like superconductivity, correlated Mott-like insulating states and orbital ferromagnetism are driven by strong-correlation physics that defies classical theories. The inadequacy of such classical models and the lack of theoretical understanding of the recently observed exotic phenomena calls for revisiting the theory behind the material system and associating it with the observed behaviour. This article reviews the physics behind twisted bilayer graphene, focusing primarily on moir\'e physics and the importance of electronic (flat) band structure. In addition, this paper provides a brief overview of the emerging phenomena of correlated insulating states, superconductivity and orbital ferromagnetism. Finally, the most recent developments in controlling the interaction-driven states and tuning the electronic interactions are presented.</description>

      <title>Large dynamical magnetic effective charges in the Jahn-Teller KCoF$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute from density functional theory calculations the dynamical magnetic effective charges of the Jahn-Teller ground state of KCoF$_3$ and we unexpectedly obtain the largest up-to-date values reported in real materials (close to 200$\times 10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{\r{A}}$). We determine that those large values are due to both spin and orbital contributions, as expected from the presence of unquenched Co-d orbital magnetic moment, even though we show that the Co dynamical magnetic effective charges values are surprisingly zero by symmetry. Hence, we conclude that even if KCoF$_3$ is not multiferroic, it is antimagnetoelectric with a compensating but large individual magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. Our study shows that the dynamical magnetic effective charges might be an important property of magnetic materials beyond the magnetoelectric ones.</description>

      <title>Finite Entanglement Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, which is the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite entanglement scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite entanglement scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., proportional to boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-from symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

      <title>A novel Kagome uud-ddu spin order in Heisenberg spin-1/2 Clinoatacamite Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, the parent compound of Herbertsmithite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly identified field-induced up-up-down order in Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ etc. renewed attention on exotic phases in spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnets. Here, we report a unique zero-field noncoplanar up,up,down, down,down,up Kagome spin order in spin-1/2 antiferromagnet Clinoatacamite, Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, which consists of weakly-coupled Kagome layers and was known as the parent compound for the most researched spin liquid candidate Herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. The two-dimensional uud-ddu Kagome order develops below T$_{N1}$ = 18.1 K in Clinoatacamite before a further transition into a three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures below T$_{N2}$ ~ 6.4 K with persistent spin fluctuations. The present work reveals a new unpredicted Kagome order in a readily accessible temperature range in the parent compound of a well-studied spin liquid. In addition, it has also solved a puzzling issue for a mysterious magnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Probing Chiral Kitaev Spin Liquids via Dangling Boundary Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying experimental probes capable of diagnosing extreme quantum behavior is widely regarded as one of the foremost challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a novel approach for detecting chiral Kitaev spin liquid states through measurements of the local dynamical spin structure factor on the boundary using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We specifically focus on unpaired ("dangling") Majorana fermions, which naturally emerge along boundaries of Kitaev spin liquids, and can serve as indicators of chiral boundary modes under broad conditions, thereby offering a clear signature of these exotic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Site Selective Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Partial Order in Kondo Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the combination of a new effective Hamiltonian approach and hybrid Monte-Carlo simulations, we unveil a variety of partially magnetically ordered (PMO) phases in the Kondo lattice model. Our approximation is motivated by two crucial features of the Hamiltonian: (i) formation of Kondo singlets leading to vanishing local magnetic moments, and (ii) spatially correlated nature of the effective single-particle kinetic energy. We discover PMO phases with fractional values $1/4$, $3/8$, and $1/2$ of Kondo-screened sites. A common understanding of these states emerges in terms of a non-local ordering mechanism. The concept of site-selective spontaneous symmetry breaking introduced here provides a new general approach to study models of interacting fermions in the intermediate coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamical Spin Correlations in the Kitaev Model at Finite Temperatures via Green's Function Equation of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, renowned for its exact solvability and potential to host non-Abelian anyons, remains a focal point in the study of quantum spin liquids and topological phases. While much of the existing literature has employed Majorana fermion techniques to analyze the model, particularly at zero temperature, its finite-temperature behavior has been less thoroughly explored via alternative approaches. In this paper, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of the Kitaev model using the spin Green's function formalism. This approach enables the computation of key physical quantities such as spin correlations, magnetic susceptibility, and the dynamical spin structure factor, offering crucial insights into the system's thermal dynamics. In solving the equation of motion for the spin Green's function, we truncate the hierarchy of multi-spin Green's functions using a decoupling approximation, which proves to be particularly accurate at high temperatures. Our results show several similarities with Majorana-based numerical simulations, though notable differences emerge. Specifically, both static and dynamical spin-spin correlation functions capture not only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations but also simple spin-flip excitations, with the latter overshadowing the former. Interestingly, without explicitly assuming fractionalization, our results for the spin susceptibility and spin relaxation rate still suggest the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom at low temperatures. This study provides a complementary approach to understanding the thermal properties of the Kitaev model, which could be relevant for future experiments and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Constructing Emergent U(1) Symmetries in the Gamma-prime $\left(\bf \Gamma^{\prime} \right)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets can elude the paradigm of conventional symmetry breaking and instead exhibit signatures of emergent symmetries at low temperatures. Such symmetries arise from "accidental" degeneracies within the ground state manifold and have been explored in a number of disparate models, in both two and three dimensions. Here we report the systematic construction of a family of classical spin models that, for a wide variety of lattice geometries with triangular motifs in one, two and three spatial dimensions, such as the kagome or hyperkagome lattices, exhibit an emergent, continuous U(1) symmetry. This is particularly surprising because the underlying Hamiltonian actually has very little symmetry - a bond-directional, off-diagonal exchange model inspired by the microscopics of spin-orbit entangled materials (the $\Gamma^{\prime}$-model). The construction thus allows for a systematic study of the interplay between the emergent continuous U(1) symmetry and the underlying discrete Hamiltonian symmetries in different lattices across different spatial dimensions. We discuss the impact of thermal and quantum fluctuations in lifting the accidental ground state degeneracy via the thermal and quantum order-by-disorder mechanisms, and how spatial dimensionality and lattice symmetries play a crucial role in shaping the physics of the model. Complementary Monte Carlo simulations, for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattice geometries, provide a complete account of the thermodynamics and confirm our analytical expectations.</description>

      <title>Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy of correlated lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) has been established in quantum chemistry as a powerful tool for studying the nonlinear response and nonequilibrium dynamics of molecular systems. More recently, the technique has also been applied to correlated electron materials, where the interplay of localized and itinerant states makes the interpretation of the spectra more challenging. Here we use the Keldysh contour representation of effective models and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory to systematically study the MDCS signals of prototypical correlated lattice systems. By analyzing the current induced by sequences of ultrashort laser pulses we demonstrate the usefulness of MDCS as a diagnostic tool for excitation pathways and coherent processes in correlated solids. We also show that this technique allows to extract detailed information on the nature and evolution of photo-excited nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian quantum spin ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum of a bipartite quantum system is given by the distribution of eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian. In this work, we compute the entanglement spectrum in the vacuum state for a subregion of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) admitting a holographic dual. In the case of a spherical (or planar) entangling surface, we recover known results in two dimensions, including the Cardy formula in the high energy regime. In higher dimensions $d&gt;2$, we analytically determine a generalization of the Cardy formula valid at large energies and consistent with previous studies of CFT spectra in the literature. We also investigate numerically the spectrum at energy levels far above the modular ground state energy. We extend our analysis to the supersymmetric point of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, providing exact results when $d=2,3$, and a generalization of the Cardy formula at high energies in generic dimension $d$. We consider small shape deformations of a spherical entangling surface, for both the non-supersymmetric and the supersymmetric cases. In all cases we find that the high-energy scaling of the microcanonical entropy with the modular energy is unaffected by the shape deformation. This result suggests that the high-energy regime of the entanglement spectra carries universal information, independent of the shape of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature thermoelectric transport in the disordered two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interaction corrections to the thermoelectric transport coefficient $\alpha$ and the thermopower $S$ in the two-dimensional disordered electron gas with long-range Coulomb interactions. To this end, we analyze the heat density-density correlation function using the recently derived generalized non-linear sigma model with particle-hole asymmetry. We present a detailed account of the perturbative calculation of the correlation function, the analysis of its structure, and the derivation of the final results for the transport coefficients. We show that both real and virtual processes give rise to logarithmic interaction corrections to $\alpha$ and $S$ with $\delta \alpha/\alpha&lt;0$ and $\delta S/S&lt;0$ in the diffusive transport regime $T\ll 1/\tau$, where $T$ is the temperature and $1/\tau$ is the disorder scattering rate. A short account of our findings is presented in an accompanying letter.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and minimal models for flat and corrugated CuO monolayers: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{CuO}$ atomic thin monolayer ($\mathrm{mlCuO}$) was synthesized recently. Interest in the $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ is based on its close relation to $\mathrm{CuO_2}$ layers in typical high temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we present the calculation of the band structure, the density of states and the Fermi surface of the flat $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ as well as the corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ within the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In the flat $\mathrm{mlCuO}$, the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, while the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{xz,yz}$ hybridized band is located just below it. The corrugation leads to a significant shift of the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{xz,yz}$ hybridized band down in energy and a degeneracy lifting for the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands. Corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ is more energetically favorable than the flat one. In addition, we compared the electronic structure of the considered $\mathrm{CuO}$ monolayers with bulk $\mathrm{CuO}$ systems. We also investigated the influence of a crystal lattice strain (which might occur on some interfaces) on the electronic structure of both $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ and determined the critical strains of topological Lifshitz transitions. Finally, we proposed a number of different minimal models for the flat and the corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ using projections onto different Wannier functions basis sets and obtained the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix elements in a real space.</description>

      <title>Towers of Quantum Many-body Scars from Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several models with multiple quantum many-body scars (QMBS) using integrable boundary states~(IBS). We focus on the tilted N\'eel states, which are parametrized IBS of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and show that these states can be used to construct a tower of scar states. Our models exhibit periodic revival dynamics, showcasing a characteristic behavior of superpositions of QMBS. Furthermore, the tower of QMBS found in this study possesses a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) structure, indicating that QMBS are equally spaced in energy. This approach can be extended to two-dimensional models, which can be decomposed into an array of one-dimensional models. In this case, the tilted N\'eel states again serve as parent states for multiple scar states. These states demonstrate low entanglement entropy, marking them as exact scar states. Notably, their entanglement entropy adheres to the sub-volume law, further solidifying the nonthermal properties of QMBS. Our results provide novel insights into constructing QMBS using IBS, thereby illuminating the connection between QMBS and integrable models.</description>

      <title>Observation of Majorana zero modes emerged from topological Dirac semimetal states under uniaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological properties observed in iron-based superconductors extend our understanding of vortex Majorana quasiparticle excitations in unexpected ways. Vortex Majorana physics has been extensively studied within the context of the topologically protected surface Dirac state. By employing an in-situ strain device, we demonstrate that uniaxial strain can generate Majorana zero modes out of the topological Dirac semimetal bulk state in LiFeAs. Uniaxial strain along [100] direction is found to enhance the band renormalization of LiFeAs, effectively reducing the energy separation between the Fermi level and the topological Dirac semimetal state, and breaking C4 symmetry. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe the evolution of vortex bound states in the topological Dirac semimetal state region, accompanied by the emergence of Majorana zero modes and vortex bound states contributed by the bulk band. Our work provides a controllable method for experimentally engineering Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors, and offers valuable insights into the topological Dirac semimetal state with intrinsic s-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying strain to epitaxial thin films has proven to be an effective approach for controlling material properties, paving the way for "materials by design". In this study, we explore this concept in the context of topological Kagome antiferromagnets, which can exhibit a range of exotic magnetic states. One such material, Mn$_{3}$Sn, features a non-collinear yet coplanar inverse triangular spin order that lacks scalar spin chirality. By applying anisotropic strain to reduce the point group symmetry of the Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, and utilizing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in epitaxial Mn$_{3}$Sn heterostructures, we achieve a canting of the manganese spins out of the Kagome plane. This newly induced magnetic state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature, which can be fully controlled by charge current, enabling the realization of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states.</description>

      <title>Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli counts much lower than commonly considered molecular simulations in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum physics is the accurate simulation of fermionic systems, particularly those involving strong correlations. While effective for bosonic systems, traditional quantum Monte Carlo methods encounter the notorious sign problem when applied to Fermions, often resulting in biased outcomes through the fixed-node approximation. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to address these limitations by allowing nodal structures to be learned through gradient descent optimization iterations and the variational algorithm. Using a neural network to represent the wave function, we focus on quantum dots containing up to 30 electrons. The results show a significant reduction in the variational bias, achieving greater accuracy and a lower ground state energy than diffusion Monte Carlo with the fixed-node approximation. Our approach paves the way for precise and accurate property predictions in fermionic strongly correlated systems, advancing fundamental understanding and applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>First principle prediction of structural distortions in the cuprates and their impact on the electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how density functional theory can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to: (a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material nearly degenerate in energy with the AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure including its long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions that match high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements; and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation for the structural origins of the so-called ``shadow bands''. We also show how one must go beyond band theory and include fully dynamic spin fluctuations via a many-body approach when aiming to make quantitative predictions to measure the ARPES spectra in the overdoped material. Finally, regarding spatial inhomogeneity, we show that the local structure at the CuO$_2$ layer, rather than dopant electrostatic effects, modulates the local charge-transfer gaps, local correlation strengths, and by extension the local superconducting gaps.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We document the ground state phase diagram of the one-dimensional Kitaev chain with quasi-periodic disorder in the presence of two-body interactions. Our data was obtained for systems of $L=1000$ sites using large-scale density matrix renormalization group numerics and is benchmarked against known results for the clean system. We demonstrate that moderate quasi-periodic disorder stabilizes the topological phase both for repulsive and attractive interactions. For larger disorder strengths, the system features re-entrance behavior and multiple phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Stacking of charge-density waves in 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ ab-initio electronic structure calculations to investigate the charge-density waves and periodic lattice distortions in bilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$. We demonstrate that the vertical stacking can give rise to a variety of patterns that may lower the symmetry of the charge-density waves exhibited separately by the two composing 1H-NbSe$_2$ monolayers. The general tendency to a spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in the ground state and the first excited states is shown to originate from a non-negligible inter-layer coupling. Simulated images for scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) as well as diffraction/scattering patterns show signatures of the different stacking orders. This may not only be useful to reinterpret past experiments on surfaces and thin films, but may also be exploited to devise ad-hoc experiments for the investigation of the stacking order in 2H-NbSe$_2$. We anticipate that our analysis does not only apply to the 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayer, but is also relevant for thin films and bulk, whose smallest centro-symmetric component is indeed the bilayer. Finally, our results illustrate clearly that the vertical stacking is not only important for 1T structures, as exemplified by the metal-to-insulator transition observed in 1T-TaS$_2$, but seems to be a general feature of metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenides as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

While time-crystalline behavior results from, e.g., many-body localization, here we show that ever-revolving solitary waves emerge in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems. The phenomenon is rather general for a variety of frustrated spin systems in one, two, and three dimensions as well as for Hubbard systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool to study two-dimensional strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we extend the iPEPS toolbox by a method to efficiently evaluate non-equal time two-point correlators, enabling the computation of spectral functions. It is based on an iPEPS ansatz of the ground state in a large unit cell, with an operator applied in the center of the cell, which is evolved in real-time using the fast-full update method. At every time step, the two-point correlators within a cell are computed based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. Benchmark results for the 2D transverse field Ising model show that the main features of the dynamical structure factor can already be reproduced at relatively small bond dimensions and unit cell sizes. The results for the magnon dispersion are found to be in good agreement with previous data obtained with the iPEPS excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Stability of correlated insulating states in molecular conductors from first-principles calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic properties of molecular conductors exhibiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin order and charge order (CO) owing to electron correlation are studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. We investigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several members of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of the AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard exchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation and that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter describes these states better. For $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$, the AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$, only by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and the CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural optimization, whose stability among different \textit{X} shows the tendency consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Regime with the Universally Boosted Magnetocaloric Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across finite temperatures and fields, a quantum critical point (QCP) can extend to a quantum critical regime (QCR), characterized by prominent quantum fluctuations and universal scalings. The QCR is essential for comprehending many-body systems and correlated quantum materials, attracting intensive research interest over the past decades. In this study, we identify a distinct quantum supercritical regime (QSR) that also originates from the QCP but is driven by a symmetry-breaking field $h$, which couples to the order parameter. The QSR has crossover lines following $T \propto h^{\frac{z\nu}{\beta+\gamma}}$, where $\beta, \gamma, z, \nu$ are the critical exponents. Amongst other intriguing phenomena in QSR, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) exhibits a universally diverging magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio as $\Gamma_h \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial h})_{S} \propto T^{-\frac{\beta+\gamma}{z\nu}}$. This constitutes a boost in the universal MCE, when compared to that of QCR, as even a small field $h$ can induce a dramatic temperature variation. Experimental realizations involving quantum Ising and Heisenberg magnets are discussed. These systems offer an ideal platform for investigating quantum supercriticality and also hold significant potential as advanced refrigerants.</description>

      <title>Interaction corrections to the thermopower of the disordered two-dimensional electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At low temperatures, the transport coefficients in the disordered electron gas acquire quantum corrections as a result of the complex interplay of disorder and interactions. The interaction corrections to the electric conductivity have their origin in virtual processes with typical electronic energies far exceeding the temperature. Here, we study interaction corrections $\delta S$ to the thermopower $S$ of the two-dimensional disordered electron gas with long-range Coulomb interactions. We show that while both real and virtual processes contribute to these corrections, the real processes are dominant and lead to a logarithmic temperature dependence of $\delta S/S$ with $\delta S/S&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>More quantum chemistry with fewer qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, and molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favorable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse. A simple set of projective measurements can capture the quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and non-Hermiticity in free-fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Learning State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Phases of Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body ground state preparation is an important subroutine used in the simulation of physical systems. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and efficient framework for obtaining a state preparation circuit for a large class of many-body ground states. We introduce polynomial-time classical algorithms that take reduced density matrices over $\mathcal{O}(1)$-sized balls as inputs, and output a circuit that prepares the global state. We introduce algorithms applicable to (i) short-range entangled states (e.g., states prepared by shallow quantum circuits in any number of dimensions, and more generally, invertible states) and (ii) long-range entangled ground states (e.g., the toric code on a disk). Both algorithms can provably find a circuit whose depth is asymptotically optimal. Our approach uses a variant of the quantum Markov chain condition that remains robust against constant-depth circuits. The robustness of this condition makes our method applicable to a large class of states, whilst ensuring a classically tractable optimization landscape.</description>
