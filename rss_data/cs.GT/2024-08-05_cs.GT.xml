      <title>Strategic Coalitions in Networked Contest Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation formulations multiple agents compete over different contests by committing their limited resources in them. For these settings, contest games offer a game-theoretic foundation to analyze how players can efficiently invest their resources. In this class of games the resulting behavior can be affected by external interactions among the players. In particular, players could be able to make coalitions that allow transferring resources among them, seeking to improve their outcomes. In this work, we study bilateral budgetary transfers in contest games played over networks. Particularly, we characterize the family of networks where there exist mutually beneficial bilateral transfer for some set of systems parameters. With this in mind, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of mutually beneficial transfers. Moreover, we provide a constructive argument that guarantees that the benefit of making coalitions only depends on mild connectivity conditions of the graph structure. Lastly, we provide a characterization of the improvement of the utilities as a function of the transferred budget. Further, we demonstrate how gradient-based dynamics can be utilized to find desirable coalitional structures. Interestingly, our findings demonstrate that such collaborative opportunities extend well beyond the typical "enemy-of-my-enemy" alliances.</description>

      <title>How much should you pay for restaking security?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restaking protocols have aggregated billions of dollars of security by utilizing token incentives and payments. A natural question to ask is: How much security do restaked services \emph{really} need to purchase? To answer this question, we expand a model of Durvasula and Roughgarden [DR24] that includes incentives and an expanded threat model consisting of strategic attackers and users. Our model shows that an adversary with a strictly submodular profit combined with strategic node operators who respond to incentives can avoid the large-scale cascading failures of~[DR24]. We utilize our model to construct an approximation algorithm for choosing token-based incentives that achieve a given security level against adversaries who are bounded in the number of services they can simultaneously attack. Our results suggest that incentivized restaking protocols can be secure with proper incentive management.</description>

      <title>A Quantal Response Analysis of Defender-Attacker Sequential Security Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a scenario involving two sites and a sequential game between a defender and an attacker, where the defender is responsible for securing the sites while the attacker aims to attack them. Each site holds a loss value for the defender when compromised, along with a probability of successful attack. The defender can reduce these probabilities through security investments at each site. The attacker's objective is to target the site that maximizes the expected loss for the defender, taking into account the defender's security investments. While previous studies have examined security investments in such scenarios, our work investigates the impact of bounded rationality exhibited by the defender, as identified in behavioral economics. Specifically, we consider quantal behavioral bias, where humans make errors in selecting efficient (pure) strategies. We demonstrate the existence of a quantal response equilibrium in our sequential game and analyze how this bias affects the defender's choice of optimal security investments. Additionally, we quantify the inefficiency of equilibrium investments under quantal decision-making compared to an optimal solution devoid of behavioral biases. We provide numerical simulations to validate our main findings.</description>

      <title>Randomized Strategyproof Mechanisms with Best of Both Worlds Fairness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of mechanism design for allocating a set of indivisible items among agents with private preferences on items. We are interested in such a mechanism that is strategyproof (where agents' best strategy is to report their true preferences) and is expected to ensure fairness and efficiency to a certain degree. We first present an impossibility result that a deterministic mechanism does not exist that is strategyproof, fair and efficient for allocating indivisible chores. We then utilize randomness to overcome the strong impossibility. For allocating indivisible chores, we propose a randomized mechanism that is strategyproof in expectation as well as ex-ante and ex-post (best of both worlds) fair and efficient. For allocating mixed items, where an item can be a good (i.e., with a positive utility) for one agent but a chore (i.e., a with negative utility) for another, we propose a randomized mechanism that is strategyproof in expectation with best of both worlds fairness and efficiency when there are two agents.</description>

      <title>Distribution Aggregation via Continuous Thiele's Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of \textit{Continuous Thiele's Rules} that generalize the familiar \textbf{Thiele's rules} \cite{janson2018phragmens} of multi-winner voting to distribution aggregation problems. Each rule in that class maximizes $\sum_if(\pi^i)$ where $\pi^i$ is an agent $i$'s satisfaction and $f$ could be any twice differentiable, increasing and concave real function. Based on a single quantity we call the \textit{'Inequality Aversion'} of $f$ (elsewhere known as "Relative Risk Aversion"), we derive bounds on the Egalitarian loss, welfare loss and the approximation of \textit{Average Fair Share}, leading to a quantifiable, continuous presentation of their inevitable trade-offs. In particular, we show that the Nash Product Rule satisfies\textit{ Average Fair Share} in our setting.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Based Community-Aware Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining the mechanisms underlying the formation and evolution of opinions within real-world social systems, which consist of numerous individuals, can provide valuable insights for effective social functioning and informed business decision making. The focus of our study is on the dynamics of opinions inside a networked multi-agent system. We provide a novel approach called the Game Theory Based Community-Aware Opinion Formation Process (GCAOFP) to accurately represent the co-evolutionary dynamics of communities and opinions in real-world social systems. The GCAOFP algorithm comprises two distinct steps in each iteration. 1) The Community Dynamics Process conceptualizes the process of community formation as a non-cooperative game involving a finite number of agents. Each individual agent aims to maximize their own utility by adopting a response that leads to the most favorable update of the community label. 2) The Opinion Formation Process involves the updating of an individual agent's opinion within a community-aware framework that incorporates bounded confidence. This process takes into account the updated matrix of community members and ensures that an agent's opinion aligns with the opinions of others within their community, within certain defined limits. The present study provides a theoretical proof that under any initial conditions, the aforementioned co-evolutionary dynamics process will ultimately reach an equilibrium state. In this state, both the opinion vector and community member matrix will stabilize after a finite number of iterations. In contrast to conventional opinion dynamics models, the guaranteed convergence of agent opinion within the same community ensures that the convergence of opinions takes place exclusively inside a given community.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Processes with Sure Parity and Multiple Reachability Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding strategies that satisfy a mixture of sure and threshold objectives in Markov decision processes. We focus on a single $\omega$-regular objective expressed as parity that must be surely met while satisfying $n$ reachability objectives towards sink states with some probability thresholds too. We consider three variants of the problem: (a) strict and (b) non-strict thresholds on all reachability objectives, and (c) maximizing the thresholds with respect to a lexicographic order. We show that (a) and (c) can be reduced to solving parity games, and (b) can be solved in $\sf{EXPTIME}$. Strategy complexities as well as algorithms are provided for all cases.</description>

      <title>A Game Theoretic Analysis of High Occupancy Toll Lane Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimal design of High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes. The traffic authority determines the road capacity allocation between HOT lanes and ordinary lanes, as well as the toll price charged for travelers using HOT lanes who do not meet the high-occupancy eligibility criteria. We develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the decisions of travelers with heterogeneous preference parameters in values of time and carpool disutilities. These travelers choose between paying or forming carpools to use the HOT lanes, or taking the ordinary lanes. Travelers' welfare depends on the congestion cost of the lane they use, the toll payment, and the carpool disutilities. For highways with a single entrance and exit node, we provide a complete characterization of equilibrium strategies and a comparative statics analysis of how the equilibrium vehicle flow and travel time change with HOT capacity and toll price. We then extend the single segment model to highways with multiple entrance and exit nodes. We extend the equilibrium concept and propose various design objectives considering traffic congestion, toll revenue, and social welfare. Using the data collected from the HOT lane of the California Interstate Highway 880 (I-880), we formulate a convex program to estimate the travel demand and approximate the distribution of travelers' preference parameters. We then compute the optimal toll design of five segments for I-880 for achieve each one of the four objectives, and compare the optimal solution with the current toll pricing.</description>

      <title>Explaining a probabilistic prediction on the simplex with Shapley compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Originating in game theory, Shapley values are widely used for explaining a machine learning model's prediction by quantifying the contribution of each feature's value to the prediction. This requires a scalar prediction as in binary classification, whereas a multiclass probabilistic prediction is a discrete probability distribution, living on a multidimensional simplex. In such a multiclass setting the Shapley values are typically computed separately on each class in a one-vs-rest manner, ignoring the compositional nature of the output distribution. In this paper, we introduce Shapley compositions as a well-founded way to properly explain a multiclass probabilistic prediction, using the Aitchison geometry from compositional data analysis. We prove that the Shapley composition is the unique quantity satisfying linearity, symmetry and efficiency on the Aitchison simplex, extending the corresponding axiomatic properties of the standard Shapley value. We demonstrate this proper multiclass treatment in a range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Gale-Shapley View of Unique Stable Marriages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable marriage of a two-sided market with unit demand is a classic problem that arises in many real-world scenarios. In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>

      <title>Cost Allocation for Set Covering: the Happy Nucleolus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider cost allocation for set covering problems. We allocate as much cost to the elements (players) as possible without violating the group rationality condition (no subset of players pays more than covering this subset would cost), and so that the excess vector is lexicographically maximized. This is identical to the well-known nucleolus if the core of the corresponding cooperative game is nonempty, i.e., if some optimum fractional cover is integral. In general, we call this the 'happy nucleolus'. Like for the nucleolus, the excess vector contains an entry for every subset of players, not only for the sets in the given set covering instance. Moreover, it is NP-hard to compute a single entry because this requires solving a set covering problem. Nevertheless, we give an explicit family of at most $mn$ subsets, each with a trivial cover (by a single set), such that the happy nucleolus is always completely determined by this proxy excess vector; here $m$ and $n$ denote the number of sets and the number of players in our set covering instance. We show that this is the unique minimal such family in a natural sense. While computing the nucleolus for set covering is NP-hard, our results imply that the happy nucleolus can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Informative Text Evaluations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</description>

      <title>Inverse Concave-Utility Reinforcement Learning is Inverse Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</description>
