      <title>Linked open data per la valorizzazione di collezioni culturali: il dataset mythLOD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formal representation of cultural metadata has always been a challenge, considering both the heterogeneity of cultural objects and the need to document the interpretive act exercised by experts. This article provides an overview of the revalorization of the digital collection Mythologiae in Linked Open Data format. The research aims to explore the data of a collection of artworks (Mythologiae) by promoting the potential of the Semantic Web, focusing particularly on the formal representation of the association of cultural objects with literary sources, as realized by experts, also documenting their interpretations. The workflow consisted of defining the data model, cleaning and disambiguating the data, converting it (from tabular structure to graph), and conducting testing activities (particularly expert domain review of the dataset through competency questions and data visualizations). The result is the mythLOD platform, which presents the dataset and detailed research documentation. Additionally, the platform hosts two data visualization spaces (the online catalogue and a data storytelling experiment on the case study of the Aeneid) that enrich the project documentation as user-friendly test units for the dataset and constitute an additional project documentation tool and exploration of the collection.</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside the Black Box: Insights from a Digital Exhibition in the Humanities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main goals of Open Science is to make research more reproducible. There is no consensus, however, on what exactly "reproducibility" is, as opposed for example to "replicability", and how it applies to different research fields. After a short review of the literature on reproducibility/replicability with a focus on the humanities, we describe how the creation of the digital twin of the temporary exhibition "The Other Renaissance" has been documented throughout, with different methods, but with constant attention to research transparency, openness and accountability. A careful documentation of the study design, data collection and analysis techniques helps reflect and make all possible influencing factors explicit, and is a fundamental tool for reliability and rigour and for opening the "black box" of research.</description>

      <title>BrainKnow -- Extracting, Linking, and Associating Neuroscience Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast accumulation of neuroscience knowledge presents a challenge for researchers to timely and accurately locate the specific information they require. Constructing a knowledge engine that automatically extracts and organizes information from academic papers can provide researchers with timely and accurate informational services. We present the Brain Knowledge Engine (BrainKnow), which extracts and integrates neuroscience knowledge from published papers from PubMed. BrainKnow comprises a substantial repository, containing 3,626,931 relations spanning a broad spectrum of 37,011 neuroscience concepts extracted from 1817744 articles. The relations in BrainKnow can be accessed and navigated through a user-friendly web interface. Additionally, BrainKnow employs graph network algorithms for the recommendation and visualization of knowledge. BrainKnow is capable of automatic real-time updates. BrainKnow represents the first neuroscience knowledge graph that not only integrates knowledge in-depth but also facilitates fully automated updates.</description>
