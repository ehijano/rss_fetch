      <title>The IBEX Imaging Knowledge-Base: A Community Resource Enabling Adoption and Development of Immunofluoresence Imaging Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) Knowledge-Base is a central portal for researchers adopting IBEX and related 2D and 3D immunofluorescence imaging methods. The design of the Knowledge-Base is modeled after efforts in the open-source software community and includes three facets: a development platform (GitHub), static website, and service for data archiving. The Knowledge-Base facilitates the practice of open science throughout the research life cycle by providing validation data for recommended and non-recommended reagents, e.g., primary and secondary antibodies. In addition to reporting negative data, the Knowledge-Base empowers method adoption and evolution by providing a venue for sharing protocols, videos, datasets, software, and publications. A dedicated discussion forum fosters a sense of community among researchers while addressing questions not covered in published manuscripts. Together, scientists from around the world are advancing scientific discovery at a faster pace, reducing wasted time and effort, and instilling greater confidence in the resulting data.</description>

      <title>Interplay of damage and repair in the control of epithelial tissue integrity in response to cyclic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial tissues are continuously exposed to cyclic stretch. Physiological stretching has been found to regulate soft tissue function at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales, allowing tissues to preserve their homeostasis and adapt to challenges. In contrast, dysregulated or pathological stretching can induce damage and tissue fragilisation. Many mechanisms have been described for the repair of epithelial tissues across a range of time-scales. In this review, we present the timescales of (i) physiological cyclic loading regimes, (ii) strain-regulated remodelling and damage accumulation, and (iii) repair mechanisms in epithelial tissues. We discuss how fatigue in biological tissues differs from synthetic materials, in that damage can be partially or fully reversed by repair mechanisms acting on timescales shorter than cyclic loading. We highlight that timescales are critical to understanding the interplay between damage and repair in tissues that experience cyclic loading, opening up new avenues for exploring soft tissue homeostasis.</description>
