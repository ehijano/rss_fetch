      <title>Temperature and mean axial momentum vs. laser intensity of electrons released from O$_2$ by an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-empirical model is presented for the thermalized temperature $T$ and mean momentum in the direction of laser propagation &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt; of electrons released from O$_{2}$ after the passage of a focused $800$ nm ultrashort pulsed laser pulse vs. peak laser intensity $I_{0}$ to provide initial conditions for electrodynamic fluid simulations. For this, theoretical kinetic energy spectra in different directions are modified with two adjustable parameters representing the effects of electron rescatter off its parent ion during the optical cycle subsequent to ionization. The classical kinematics of rescatter, in conjunction with the spectral fits, is used to estimate &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt;.</description>

      <title>Energetic spectra from semi-implicit particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations suggest that magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas plays an important role in the acceleration of energetic particles. Modeling this accurately requires numerical schemes capable of addressing large scales and realistic magnetic field configurations without sacrificing the kinetic description needed to model particle acceleration self-consistently. We demonstrate the computational advantage of the relativistic semi-implicit method (RelSIM), which allows for reduced resolution while avoiding the numerical instabilities typically affecting standard explicit methods, helping to bridge the gap between macroscopic and kinetic scales. Two- and three-dimensional semi-implicit particle-in-cell simulations explore the linear tearing instability and the nonlinear development of reconnection and subsequent particle acceleration starting from a relativistic Harris equilibrium with no guide field. The simulations show that particle acceleration in the context of magnetic reconnection leads to energetic power-law spectra with cutoff energies, consistent with previous work done using explicit methods, but are obtained with a considerably reduced resolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of macroscale magnetic fields and fast flows in a four-component astrophysical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of the generation or amplification of macroscale magnetic fields and flows in a four-component astrophysical dusty plasma composed of mobile massless electrons and positrons, inertial positive ions and negatively charged static dust particles. The investigation demonstrates that when microscopic turbulent ambient plasma energy is predominantly kinetic, a straight dynamo (DY) mechanism is feasible. Conversely, a unified reverse-dynamo/dynamo (RDY/DY) mechanism is possible when the microscopic turbulent ambient plasma energy is primarily magnetic. Additionally, the evolution of Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers at the macro- and microscale are significantly affected by plasma species densities and invariant helicities. The potential implications of the present study for astrophysical settings are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>On the Poisson brackets of hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the Jacobi identity holds for a class of recently introduced anti-symmetric brackets for the hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons. In particular, we establish the precise conditions under which the brackets for the vector-potential-based formulations satisfy the Jacobi identity, and demonstrate that these conditions are fulfilled by all physically relevant functionals. Moreover, for the magnetic-field-based formulation, we show that the corresponding anti-symmetric bracket constitutes a Poisson bracket under the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, and we provide a direct proof of the Jacobi identity. These results are further extended to models incorporating electron entropy as well as more general hybrid kinetic-fluid models.</description>

      <title>Glow discharge induced reactions in mixtures of ozone and chlorodifluoromethane with atmospheric gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of extraterrestrial particles like cosmic radiation (CR) on the chemistry and ozone density in the Earth stratosphere is not well investigated and normally neglected in stratospheric chemistry models. Here we present the commissioning of a lab-based apparatus which aims at simulating conditions in the stratosphere in order to get better insight into the reactions induced by the secondary-particle showers from high-energetic CR which can reach low altitudes. Admixtures of ozone and the halocarbon CHClF2 (R22, chlorodifluoromethane) to atmospheric gases (N2, O2, Ar) were exposed to a glow discharge in the total pressure regime of a few hPa. According to the mass spectrometric analysis of the gas composition the discharge initiates significant ozone depletion by a factor four in the absence of R22. This depletion is strongly enhanced to two orders of magnitude in the presence of R22. The possible underlying reactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and high aspect ratio tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success in describing type-I ELM and QH-mode pedestals in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening the route for the integration of this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit local 2nd stability access and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing High-fidelity Plasma Turbulence with Data-driven Tuning of Diffusion in Low Resolution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing physically consistent closure models is a longstanding challenge in simulating plasma turbulence, even in minimal systems such as the two-field Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model, which captures essential features of drift-wave turbulence with a reduced set of variables. In this work, we leverage theoretical insights from Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) to construct a six-term closure structure that captures the dominant turbulent transport processes, including both diffusion and hyper-diffusion. While the mathematical form of the closure is fully prescribed by DIA, the corresponding transport coefficients are learned from data using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The resulting Extended HW model with Closure (EHW-C) model reveals several nontrivial features of plasma turbulence: notably, some inferred coefficients become negative in certain regimes, indicating inverse transport, a phenomenon absent in conventional closure models. Moreover, the EHW-C model accurately reproduces the spectral and flux characteristics of high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), while requiring only one-eighth the spatial resolution per direction, yielding a tenfold speed-up. This work demonstrates how theory-guided machine learning can both enhance computational efficiency and uncover emergent transport mechanisms in strongly nonlinear plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Helical Core Formation and MHD Stability in ITER-Scale Plasmas with Fusion-born Alpha Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of fusion-born alpha particles on the helical core (HC), a long-lived ideal saturation state of the $m/n=1/1$ kink/quasi-interchange mode, is studied in the ITER-scale hybrid scenario where a core plasma has a low magnetic shear $q\gtrsim1$. The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance and all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety factor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An incomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic axis, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$. Using MHD-PIC simulations, we find that $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ is enhanced by increasing alpha particle pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$. Within the ITER operating alpha pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0) \lesssim 1\%$, $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ can be approximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there is no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC preserves the omnigenity of the plasma. If one increases $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)$ beyond $1\%$, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ continues to increase with $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ until it reaches an upper limit at $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)=3\%$ for our reference case. At this limit, both the bulk and alpha pressure profiles are partially flattened, indicating a reduction in omnigenity. After HC formation, a resistive pressure-driven MHD mode can become unstable, which is localized along the compressed magnetic flux region of the HC. This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of short-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part of a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to adequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results suggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma confinement.</description>

      <title>A high-performance elliptic solver for plasma boundary turbulence codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic equations play a crucial role in turbulence models for magnetic confinement fusion. Regardless of the chosen modeling approach - whether gyrokinetic, gyrofluid, or drift-fluid - the Poisson equation and Amp\`{e}re's law lead to elliptic problems that must be solved on 2D planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. In this work, we present an efficient solver for such generalised elliptic problems, especially suited for the conditions in the boundary region. A finite difference discretisation is employed, and the solver is based on a flexible generalised minimal residual method (fGMRES) with a geometric multigrid preconditioner. We present implementations with OpenMP parallelisation and GPU acceleration, with backends in CUDA and HIP. On the node level, significant speed-ups are achieved with the GPU implementation, exceeding external library solutions such as rocALUTION. In accordance with theoretical scaling laws for multigrid methods, we observe linear scaling of the solver with problem size, $O(N)$. This solver is implemented in the PARALLAX/PAccX libraries and serves as a central component of the plasma boundary turbulence codes GRILLIX and GENE-X.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electron heating in laboratory magnetized quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present laboratory results from supercritical, magnetized collisionless shock experiments ($M_A \lesssim 10$, $\beta\sim 1$). We report the first observation of fully-developed shocks ($R=4$ compression ratio and a downstream region decoupled from the piston) after seven upstream ion gyration periods. A foot ahead of the shock exhibits super-adiabatic electron and ion heating. We measure the electron temperature $T_e = 115$ eV and ion temperature $T_i = 15$ eV upstream of the shock; whereas, downstream, we measure $T_e=390$ eV and infer $T_i=340$ eV, consistent with both Thomson scattering ion-acoustic wave spectral broadening and Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. The downstream electron temperature has a $30$-percent excess from adiabatic and collisional electron-ion heating, implying significant collisionless anomalous electron heating. Furthermore, downstream electrons and ions are in equipartition, with a unity electron-ion temperature ratio $T_e/T_i = 1.2$.</description>

      <title>Development of a national thrust test facility for electric propulsion at Robinson Research Institute, New Zealand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD) thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to the facilities are in progress or planned.</description>

      <title>Magnitude of Short-Wavelength Electric Field Fluctuations in Simulations of Collisionless Plasma Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-amplitude electrostatic fluctuations are routinely observed by spacecraft upon traversal of collisionless shocks in the heliosphere. Kinetic simulations of shocks have struggled to reproduce the amplitude of such fluctuations, complicating efforts to understand their influence on energy dissipation and shock structure. In this paper, 1D particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature $T_e$ exceeding the ion temperature $T_i$, the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, reaching realistic values at $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce} \gtrsim 30$. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes. In the cases where upstream temperature ratio is reversed, the magnitude of the fluctuations remains small.</description>

      <title>Taylor series perspective on ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations with Fermi-Dirac statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in \emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\xi$ [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we express the original isothermal $\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the applicability of the $\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the direct PIMC evaluation of the $\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the necessity for simulations at different values of $\xi$ and can facilitate more efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.</description>

      <title>Probing laser-driven surface and subsurface dynamics via grazing-incidence XFEL scattering and diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter. Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect instability seeding and burn propagation.</description>

      <title>Including the vacuum energy in stellarator coil design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being three-dimensional, stellarators have the advantage that plasma currents are not essential for creating rotational-transform; however, the external current-carrying coils in stellarators can have strong geometrical shaping, which can complicate the construction. Reducing the inter-coil electromagnetic forces acting on strongly shaped 3D coils and the stress on the support structure while preserving the favorable properties of the magnetic field is a design challenge. In this work, we recognize that the inter-coil forces are the gradient of the vacuum magnetic energy. We introduce an objective functional built on the usual quadratic flux on a prescribed target surface together with a weighed penalty on the vacuum energy. The Euler-Lagrange equation for stationary states is derived, and numerical illustrations are computed using a modern stellarator optimization framework. A study of the effect of the energy functional on the inter-coil forces is conducted and the energy is shown to be a promising quantity in producing coils with low forces.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of electron energy from laser wakefield accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Bayesian optimization in combination with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to determine the optimal laser and plasma parameters that, for a given laser pulse energy, maximize the cut-off energy of an electron beam produced by laser wakefield accelerators. We assume a Gaussian laser driver with matched spot size and amplitude and investigate both self-guiding in a uniform-density plasma and guiding in a preformed plasma channel with matched radius. To interpret the simulation results quantitatively, we derive novel analytical expressions for the maximum electron energy and the corresponding acceleration distance, accounting for the effects of laser diffraction and energy depletion. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential scalability of the optimal input (plasma density, pulse duration, amplitude, spot size, and channel radius) and output (electron energy, electron charge, acceleration length, and acceleration efficiency) parameters to laser systems of arbitrary energy.</description>

      <title>Modelling Cosmic-Ray Transport: Magnetized versus Unmagnetized Motion in Astrophysical Magnetic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem, and despite decades of study the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focused attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Suppression of pair beam instabilities in a laboratory analogue of blazar pair cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of dense electron-positron pair beams in the laboratory can enable direct tests of theoretical models of $\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.</description>
