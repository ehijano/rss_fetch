      <title>Weak-Coppel problem for a class of Riccati differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $T$-periodic solutions of the real Riccati differential equation $x' = x^2 + \gamma(t),$ where $x=x(t)$ and $\gamma$ is a $T$-periodic function. Our goal is to define a real-valued discriminant $\Delta_{\gamma}$ that determines whether the equation admits two, one, or no $T$-periodic solutions, in analogy with the classical discriminant of the quadratic algebraic equations. This problem is closely related to a question posed by Coppel concerning the characterization of bifurcation curves for planar quadratic differential systems. Although our result does not cover all periodic Riccati differential equations, many of them can be transformed into this particular form.</description>

      <title>Technical Developments of DA on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constructed a DA on $\mathbb{T}^3$, which complements the work of Gan, Li, Viana, and Yang (\cite{GanLiVianaYang2021}) by providing an example of a $C^\infty$-diffeomorphism with partial volume expansion, where $\dim(E^{cs}) = 2$. In contrast to their work, in \cite{GanLiVianaYang2021}, they provided an example of a non-invertible embedding in the case $\dim(E^{cs}) = 2$. The inverse map of the DA we constructed has a mostly expanding center (\cite{AnderssonVasquez2018}). Using a similar approach, we can also construct a (nontrivial) mixed center (\cite{MiCaoYang2017, MiCao2021}).</description>

      <title>On equivalence of quenched and annealed statistical properties for conservative IID random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several theorems relating annealed exponential mixing of the two-point motion with quenched properties of the one-point motion for conservative IID random dynamical systems. In particular, we show that annealed exponential mixing of the two-point motion implies quenched exponential mixing of the one-point motion. We also show that if the two-point motion satisfies annealed exponential mixing and the annealed central limit theorem with polynomial rate of convergence, then the one-point motion satisfies a quenched CLT. These results hold for all H\"older and Sobolev spaces of positive index.</description>

      <title>TumorPred: A Computational Framework Implemented via an R/Shiny Web Application for Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis in Compartmental Brain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is difficult or infeasible to directly measure how much of a drug actually enters the human brain and a brain tumor, how long it remains there, and to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters, as well as how changes in these parameters influence model outputs and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Compartmental modeling offers a powerful mathematical approach to describe drug distribution and elimination in the body using systems of differential equations. This study introduces TumorPred, an R/Shiny-based web application designed for model simulation, sensitivity analysis, and pharmacokinetic parameter calculation in a permeability-limited four-compartment brain model. The model closely mimics human brain functionality for drug delivery and aims to predict the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the brain blood, brain mass, and cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the human brain. The app provides real-time output updates in response to input modifications and allows users to visualize and download simulated plots and data tables. The computational accuracy of TumorPred is validated against results from the Simcyp Simulator (Certara Inc.). TumorPred is freely accessible and serves as an invaluable computational tool and data-driven resource for advancing drug development and optimizing treatment strategies for more effective brain cancer therapy.</description>

      <title>Stable and unstable spatially-periodic canards created in singular subcritical Turing bifurcations in the Brusselator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Brusselator partial differential equation (PDE) in the limit in which the diffusivity of the activator is much smaller than that of the inhibitor. The PDE robustly exhibits a subcritical Turing bifurcation that, in this limit, is labeled as a singular Turing bifurcation. We show that families of spatially-periodic canard solutions emerge from this subcritical singular Turing bifurcation. Then, right after they emerge, the solutions lose their purely sinusoidal structure ($e^{ik_Tx}$, where $k_T$ is the critical wavenumber at the Turing bifurcation) and gain a distinct multi-scale spatial structure. They consist of segments along which the components vary gradually in space, interspersed with short intervals on which the activator component exhibits pulses and steep gradients. The branches of these spatially-periodic canards undergo a saddle-node bifurcation. Some of the large-amplitude patterns on the upper branches are attractors of the PDE, and unstable patterns with small pulses that exist below the folds appear to guide the evolution of data to the attractors. We also analyze the spatial ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern time-independent solutions. We show that the spatial ODE system has a folded singularity known as a reversible folded saddle-node of type II (RFSN-II) point that coincides with the Turing bifurcation in the singular limit. We demonstrate that, for parameter values close to the Turing bifurcation, the true and faux canards of the RFSN-II point are responsible for generating the spatially-periodic canards, and for parameter values away from the Turing value there is a reversible folded saddle point whose true and faux canards generate the spatially-periodic canard solutions. Overall, we identify the RFSN-II and RFS folded singularities and their canards as new selection mechanisms for subcritical bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Linearly Stable KAM Tori for One Dimensional Forced Kirchhoff Equations under Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an abstract infinite dimensional KAM theorem, which could be applied to prove the existence and linear stability of small-amplitude quasi-periodic solutions for one dimensional forced Kirchhoff equations with periodic boundary conditions
  \[ u_{tt}-(1+\int_{0}^{2\pi} |u_x|^2 dx)u_{xx}+
  M_\xi u+\epsilon g(\bar{\omega}t,x) =0,\quad u(t,x+2\pi)=u(t,x),\]
  where $M_\xi$ is a real Fourier multiplier, $g(\bar{\omega}t,x)$ is real analytic with forced Diophantine frequencies $\bar\omega$, $\epsilon$ is a small parameter.
  The paper generalizes the previous results from the simple eigenvalue to the double eigenvalues under the quasi-linear perturbation.</description>

      <title>Approximation by invariant Dirac measures on non-positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of probability measures invariant under the geodesic flow, defined on the unit-tangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature. Building on a previous work by Coud\`ene and Schapira we introduce the set of \textit{weakly regular} vectors, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_w$: a vector in the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is weakly regular if for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, its $\epsilon$-stable set and $\epsilon$-unstable set both intersect the set $\Omega_{NF}$ of non-wandering vectors whose orbit does not bound a flat strip. We show that every ergodic probability measure supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$ can be approximated by Dirac measures supported on periodic orbits in $\Omega_{NF}$. As a consequence, ergodicity is a generic property in the space of invariant measures supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$. We illustrate our findings using a famous example of rank-one manifold attributed to Heintze and Gromov, demonstrating that in this setting the inclusion $\Omega_{NF} \subset \mathcal{R}_w$ is proper and $\mathcal{R}_w$ is the maximal subset of the unit-tangent bundle satisfying the density property stated above. Finally, as a consequence of our main result, we describe the topology of the closure of the set of ergodic probability measures and provide a complete decomposition of the space of finite invariant measures on the unit-tangent bundle of the Heintze-Gromov manifold.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously bounded and dense orbits for commuting Cartan actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the set of points that have bounded orbits under one regular diagonal flow and dense orbits under the other diagonal flow commuting with the first one has full Hausdorff dimension in $X_3=\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  To explain its application towards the Uniform Littlewood's Conjecture proposed in \cite{BFK25}, we introduce the concept of ``fiberwise nondivergence'' for the action of a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup. Then our main result implies that there exists a dense subset of $X_3$ in which each point has a fiberwise non-divergent orbit under a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup and an unbounded orbit under every diagonal flow.</description>

      <title>Averaged dynamics of ultra-relativisitc charged particles beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.4184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider the suitability of using the charged cold fluid model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained. Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same. Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC: Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning methodologies have attracted considerable attention for the control and estimation of dynamical systems. However, such implementations suffer from a lack of predictability and robustness. Thus, adoption of data-driven tools has been minimal for safety-aware applications despite their impressive empirical results. While classical tools like robust adaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with data-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to conservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently different `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy. Data-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current robust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning models and unverifiable assumptions. In this paper, we present $\mathcal{L}_1$ distributionally robust adaptive control ($\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC): a control methodology for uncertain stochastic processes that guarantees robustness certificates in terms of uniform (finite-time) and maximal distributional deviation. We leverage the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control methodology to ensure the existence of Wasserstein ambiguity set around a nominal distribution, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution. The uniform ambiguity set produces an ambiguity tube of distributions centered on the nominal temporally-varying nominal distribution. The designed controller generates the ambiguity tube in response to both epistemic (model uncertainties) and aleatoric (inherent randomness and disturbances) uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Driven Adaptive Surrogate Modeling for Simulation and Optimization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a surrogate model refinement approach for the simulation of dynamical systems and the solution of optimization problems governed by dynamical systems in which surrogates replace expensive-to-compute state- and control-dependent component functions in the dynamics or objective function. For example, trajectory simulation and optimization tasks for an aircraft depend on aerodynamic coefficient functions whose evaluation requires expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations for every value of the state and control encountered in simulation and optimization algorithms, which would result in prohibitively long run times, often exacerbated further by the lack of derivative information. To overcome this bottleneck, this work employs differentiable surrogates that are computed from values of the true component functions at a few points. The proposed approach updates the current surrogates on an as-needed basis as follows: given a surrogate and corresponding solution of the simulation or optimization problem, the approach combines solution sensitivity information with pointwise error estimates between the true component functions and their surrogates to define an acquisition function that is used to determine new points at which to evaluate the true component function to refine the surrogate. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of a notional hypersonic vehicle with aerodynamic coefficient models that are approximated using kernel interpolation.</description>

      <title>Detecting extreme event-driven causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of some extreme events (such as marine heatwaves or exceptional circulations) can cause other extreme events (such as heatwave, drought and flood). These concurrent extreme events have a great impact on environment and human health. However, how to detect and quantify the causes and impacts of these extreme events by a data-driven way is still unsolved. In this study, the dynamic system method is extended to develop a method for detecting the causality between extreme events. Taking the coupled Lorenz-Lorenz systems with extreme event-driven coupling as an example, it is demonstrated that this proposed detecting method is able to capture the extreme event-driven causality, with even better causality detecting performance between concurrent extreme events. Comparison among three kinds of measured series, full measurements outperform partial ones in event-to-event causality detecting. The successful applicability of our proposed approach in Walker circulation phenomenon indicates that our method contributes a novel way to the study of causal inference in complex systems. This method offers valuable insights into multi-scale, nonlinear dynamics, particularly in uncovering associations among extreme events.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $\Phi: X \dashrightarrow X$ is a dominant rational self-map of a projective surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with a regular and non-invertible iterate $\Phi^n$, then we can take $n \leq 12$. This bound is sharp and realized on $X = \mathbb{P}^2$. In the case where $\Phi$ is a birational self-map of $\mathbb{P}^2$ we prove that as long as $\Phi$ does not preserve a non-constant fibration, if some iterate $\Phi^n$ is regular then $\Phi$ itself must be regular.</description>

Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for a proper metric space endowed with a proper action by isometries of a group with a contracting element. We show that the existence of a contracting isometry is a sufficient evidence of negative curvature to carry in this context various results borrowed from hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we extend the so-called Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy proving that the geodesic flow is either conservative and ergodic or dissipative.</description>

Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we investigate the global geometry and topology of dynamical systems $\dot{x} = F(x)$ with entire vector field $F$, building on and constructively extending the local structure of simple and higher-order equilibria. We provide a step-by-step analysis to reveal topological properties of the basins of centers, nodes, and foci, while excluding isolated equilibria at the boundaries of the latter two. We propose a definition of global elliptic sectors and introduce the concept of sector-forming orbits based on the geometry within a finite elliptic decomposition of multiple equilibria. Finally, we characterize the structure of heteroclinic regions connecting two equilibria.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the high-dimensional Kuramoto model on Stiefel manifolds</title>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the convergence properties of a heterogeneous consensus model on Stiefel manifolds. We consider each agent, without interaction, moving according to the flow determined by the fundamental vector field of the right multiplication action of the orthogonal group on the Stiefel manifold. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of N such agents, assuming that, as a result of their interactions, each agent's velocity is the sum of its natural velocity and an additional velocity directed towards the average position of the N agents. If the fundamental vector fields of all agents are the same, their movement can be represented as a gradient flow on a product manifold. In this study, we specifically investigate the asymptotic behavior in a non-gradient flow setting, where the fundamental vector fields are not all the same. Since fewer tools are available to address non-gradient flows, we perform an orbital stability analysis to obtain the desired results instead of relying on a gradient flow structure. Our estimate improves upon the previous result in [Ha et al., Automatica 136 (2022)]. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the asymptotic dynamics, we derive uniform-in-time stability with respect to the initial data.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Data-Driven Estimation for Spectral Properties of Koopman Semigroup in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the spectral properties of the Koopman operator is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic dynamical systems. However, the accuracy of data-driven estimation methods, such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and its variants, are heavily dependent on the quality and location of the sampled trajectory data. This paper introduces a novel framework, Reinforced Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition, which integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD) to automatically guide the data collection process in stochastic dynamical systems. We frame the optimal sampling strategy as an RL problem, where an agent learns a policy to select trajectory initial conditions. The agent is guided by a reward signal based on \emph{spectral consistency}, that is a measure of how well the estimated Koopman eigenpairs describe the system's evolution balanced with an exploration bonus to ensure comprehensive coverage of the state space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Bandit algorithm, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms on canonical systems including the double-well potential, the stochastic Duffing oscillator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Our results show that the RL agent automatically discovers dynamically significant regions without any prior knowledge of the system. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms, directly linking the final estimation accuracy to the quality of the learned sampling policy. Our work presents a robust, automated methodology for the efficient spectral analysis of complex stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Global stability of the Atlantic overturning circulation: Edge states, long transients and a boundary crisis under CO$_2$ forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a crucial ocean current system, could transition to a weak state. Despite severe associated climate impacts, assessing the AMOC's response under global warming and its proximity to possible critical thresholds remains difficult. To understand future Earth system stability, a global dynamical view is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying classical early-warning methods. Using an intermediate-complexity climate model, we explore the stability landscape of the AMOC for different atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. We explicitly compute the edge state (or Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle on the basin boundary separating the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries, supporting centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. At increased CO$_2$ levels projected for the near future, we reveal a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor disappears by colliding with the edge state. Under crisis overshoot, long chaotic transients due to "ghost states" lead to diverging ensemble trajectories under time-varying forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an explanation of large ensemble variance and apparent "stochastic bifurcations" observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by acquiring the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. Furthermore, the number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps: we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>
