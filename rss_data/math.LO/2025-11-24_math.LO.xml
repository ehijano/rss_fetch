      <title>A Coq-based Axiomatization of Tarski's Mereogeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last decade, the domain of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, has known a renewal of interest for mereogeometry, a theory that has been initiated by Tarski. Mereogeometry relies on mereology, the Lesniewski's theory of parts and wholes that is further extended with geometrical primitives and appropriate definitions. However, most approaches (i) depart from the original Lesniewski's mereology which does not assume usual sets as a basis, (ii) restrict the logical power of mereology to a mere theory of part-whole relations and (iii) require the introduction of a connection relation. Moreover, the seminal paper of Tarki shows up unclear foundations and we argue that mereogeometry as it is introduced by Tarski, can be more suited to extend the whole theory of Lesniewski. For that purpose, we investigate a type-theoretical representation of space more closely related with the original ideas of Lesniewski and expressed with the Coq language. We show that (i) it can be given a more clear foundation, (ii) it can be based on three axioms instead of four and (iii) it can serve as a basis for spatial reasoning with full compliance with Lesniewski's systems.</description>

      <title>Tableau methodology for propositional logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set out a general methodology for producing tableau systems for propositional logics via a tableau metatheory that provides general and formal notions for different tableau systems that vary by semantics or formulae. Moreover, by dint of these general notions, some facts, independent of their applications to a particular propositional logic, can be proved. One of the examples is the tableau metatheorem that simplifies the process of constructing a complete tableau system for a given logic, just reducing it to checking specific properties of the tableau rules within the analyzed, particular system. In our paper we generalize an abstract consistency property proposed by R. Smullyan and M. Fitting from the modal case to the others. Such a methodology is essential for a deeper and universal treatment of tableau methods for various propositional languages and semantics.</description>

      <title>Cylindric quasi-implication algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the operation of Sasaki hook within the setting of quantum cylindric algebras by introducing cylindric quasi-implication algebras. It is first demonstrated that every quantum cylindric algebra can be converted into a cylindric quasi-implication algebra and conversely that every cylindric quasi-implication algebra gives rise to a quantum cylindric algebra. These constructions are then shown to induce an isomorphism between the category $\mathbf{CQIA}$ of cylindric quasi-implication algebras and the category $\mathbf{QCA}$ of quantum cylindric algebras. We then give two alternative constructions of a cylindric orthoframe $X_A$ from a cylindric quasi-implication algebra $A$. The first construction of $X_A$ arises via the non-zero elements of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by Harding in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of MacNeille completions. The second construction of $X_A$ arises via the proper filters of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by McDonald in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of canonical completions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Sets of Theories That Can Be Disjointly Combined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties that allow first-order theories to be disjointly combined, including stable infiniteness, shininess, strong politeness, and gentleness. Specifically, we describe a Galois connection between sets of decidable theories, which picks out the largest set of decidable theories that can be combined with a given set of decidable theories. Using this, we exactly characterize the sets of decidable theories that can be combined with those satisfying well-known theory combination properties. This strengthens previous results and answers in the negative several long-standing open questions about the possibility of improving existing theory combination methods to apply to larger sets of theories. Additionally, the Galois connection gives rise to a complete lattice of theory combination properties, which allows one to generate new theory combination methods by taking meets and joins of elements of this lattice. We provide examples of this process, introducing new combination theorems. We situate both new and old combination methods within this lattice.</description>

      <title>Superabelian logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified algebraic study of a family of logics related to Abelian logic (Ab), the logic of Abelian lattice-ordered groups. We treat $\Ab$ as the base system and refer to its expansions as \emph {superabelian logics}. The paper focuses on two main families of expansions. First, we investigate the rich landscape of infinitary extensions of Ab, providing an axiomatization for the infinitary logic of real numbers and showing that there exist $2^{2^\omega}$ distinct logics in this family. Second, we introduce \emph{pointed Abelian logic} (pAb), the logic of pointed Abelian lattice-ordered groups, by adding a new constant to the language. This framework includes \emph{{\L}ukasiewicz unbound logic}. We provide axiomatizations for its finitary and infinitary versions as extensions of pAb and establish their precise relationship with standard {\L}ukasiewicz logic via a formal translation. Finally, the methods developed for this analysis are generalized to axiomatize the logics of other prominent pointed groups.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the ultrafilter number function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultrafilter number function $\kappa \mapsto \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ on the cardinals is monotone, that is, whether $\mathfrak{u}(\lambda) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ holds for all cardinals $\lambda &lt; \kappa$ or not. We show that monotonicity can fail, but the failure has large cardinal strength. On the other hand, we prove that there are many restrictions of the failure of monotonicity. For instance, if $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal with countable cofinality or a strong limit singular cardinal, then $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa^+)$ holds.</description>

      <title>A poset game on submonoids of additively indecomposable ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Garc\'ia-Marco and Knauer arXiv:1705.11034, we consider the Chomp game on a natural well-partial order structure defined on submonoids $\mathcal{S}^\sigma\subseteq\omega^\sigma$ of additively indecomposable ordinals generated by sets of ordinals under natural sum and product of ordinals. We have called the generatinng sets of ordinals for which the game terminates in a finite number of steps well-partial order generators, and, under very mild conditions, we have characterized those that are finite.
  A fundamental observation is that, for every ordinal $\sigma$, there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that, for any class $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\tau;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\tau}) \mid \tau\geq\sigma\}$ of well-partial orders generated by a subset of $\omega^\sigma$, the second player has a winning strategy on all those posets or only on $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\beta;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\beta}) \mid\beta\in\alpha\}$ for some successor ordinal $\alpha\leq\xi$ (and the first player will have a winning strategy on the rest of the posets). This Hanf number-style property could be valuable in proving the existence of winning strategies. We conjecture that $ \xi $ is the smallest possible and, using results from arXiv:1908.09664, we prove that, if we restrict ourselves to the classes generated by finite sets of ordinals, $\xi&lt;|\omega^\sigma|^+$. We also explicitly describe a winning strategy for a specific family of classes.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class of monomorphisms in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of the class.</description>
