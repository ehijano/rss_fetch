      <title>Motivic Steenrod problem away from the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topology, the Steenrod problem asks whether every singular homology class is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold. Here, we introduce an analogous question in algebraic geometry: is every element on the Chow line of the motivic cohomology of $X$ the pushforward of a fundamental class along a projective derived-lci morphism? If $X$ is a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p \geq 0$, then a positive answer to this question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by alterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily so: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$ that are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A consequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be expressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the first-named-author in his thesis.</description>

      <title>Bundle-extension inverse problems over elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a number of results to the general effect that, under obviously necessary numerical and determinant constraints, "most" morphisms between fixed bundles on a complex elliptic curve produce (co)kernels which can either be specified beforehand or else meet various rigidity constraints. Examples include: (a) for indecomposable $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E'}$ with slopes and ranks increasing strictly in that order the space of monomorphisms whose cokernel is semistable and maximally rigid (i.e. has minimal-dimensional automorphism group) is open dense; (b) for indecomposable $\mathcal{K}$, $\mathcal{E}$ and stable $\mathcal{F}$ with slopes increasing strictly in that order and ranks and determinants satisfying the obvious additivity constraints the space of embeddings $\mathcal{K}\to \mathcal{E}$ whose cokernel is isomorphic to $\mathcal{F}$ is open dense; (c) the obvious mirror images of these results; (d) generalizations weakening indecomposability to semistability + maximal rigidity; (e) various examples illustrating the necessity of the assorted assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the Iitaka volumes of log canonical surfaces and threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $d\geq\kappa$, and a subset $\Gamma\subset [0,1]$, let $\mathrm{Ivol}_{\mathrm{lc}}^{\Gamma}(d,\kappa)$ denote the set of Iitaka volumes of $d$-dimensional projective log canonical pairs $(X, B)$ such that the Iitaka--Kodaira dimension $\kappa(K_X+B)=\kappa$ and the coefficients of $B$ come from $\Gamma$. In this paper, we show that, if $\Gamma$ satisfies the descending chain condition, then so does $\mathrm{Ivol}_\mathrm{lc}^\Gamma(d,\kappa)$ for $d\leq 3$. In case $d\leq 3$ and $\kappa=1$, $\Gamma$ and $\mathrm{Ivol}_\mathrm{lc}^\Gamma(d,\kappa)$ are shown to share more topological properties, such as closedness in $\mathbb{R}$ and local finiteness of accumulation complexity. In higher dimensions, we show that the set of Iitaka volumes for $d$-dimensional klt pairs with Iitaka dimension $\geq d-2$ satisfies the DCC, partially confirming a conjecture of Zhan Li.
  We give a more detailed description of the sets of Iitaka volumes for the following classes of projective log canonical surfaces: (1) smooth properly elliptic surfaces, (2) projective log canonical surfaces with coefficients from $\{0\}$ or $\{0,1\}$. In particular, the minima as well as the minimal accumulation points are found in these cases.</description>

      <title>Birational maps, PBW degenerate flags and poset polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the results on the graph closures of the birational maps between projective spaces and Grassmannians to the case of PBW degenerate flag varieties. The advantage of the PBW degenerate flags (as opposed to their classical analogues) is the existence of a large group of symmetries for the graph closures. We discuss the combinatorial, algebraic and geometric sides of the picture. In particular, we show that toric degenerations of Borovik, Sturmfels and Sverrisd\'ottir are still available in the general settings. We also derive a description of the graph closures for flag varieties in terms of quiver representations.</description>

      <title>Cones of Noether-Lefschetz divisors and moduli spaces of hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general formula for generators of the NL-cone, the cone of effective linear combinations of irreducible components of Noether-Lefschetz divisors, on an orthogonal modular variety. We then fully describe the NL-cone and its extremal rays in the cases of moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds of known deformation type for low degree polarizations. Moreover, we exhibit explicit divisors in the boundary of NL-cones for polarizations of arbitrarily large degrees. Additionally, we study the NL-positivity of the canonical class for these modular varieties. As a consequence, we obtain uniruledness results for moduli spaces of primitively polarized hyperk\"ahler manifolds of ${\rm{OG6}}$ and ${\rm{Kum}}_n$-type. Finally, we show that any family of polarized hyperk\"ahler fourfolds of ${\rm{Kum}}_2$-type with polarization of degree $2$ and divisibility $2$ over a projective base is isotrivial.</description>

      <title>Hermitian-symplectic and Kahler structures on degenerate twistor deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, \Omega)$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration $\pi: M \to B$, and $\eta$ a closed $(1,1)$-form on $B$. Then $\Omega+ \pi^* \eta$ is a holomorphically symplectic form on a complex manifold which is called the degenerate twistor deformation of $M$. We prove that degenerate twistor deformations of compact holomorphically symplectic K\"ahler manifolds are also K\"ahler. First, we prove that degenerate twistor deformations are Hermitian symplectic, that is, tamed by a symplectic form; this is shown using positive currents and an argument based on the Hahn--Banach theorem, originally due to Sullivan. Then we apply a version of Huybrechts's theorem showing that two non-separated points in the Teichm\"uller space of holomorphically symplectic manifolds correspond to bimeromorphic manifolds if they are Hermitian symplectic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called "a Tate-Shafarevich twist") is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ has no multiple fibers in codimension 1. We prove that $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

      <title>Real variations of stability on K3 categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves that the 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category associated with the preprojective algebra of an affine or hyperbolic graph admits many real variations of stability conditions, in the sense of Anno, Bezrukavnikov, and Mirkovi\'{c}. We do this by connecting the Coxeter arrangements of the graph with the homological algebra by introducing the concept of real flows. This categorifies the notion of above and below for alcoves in a hyperplane arrangement and allows us to generalise much of the machinery of real variations for affine arrangements to the hyperbolic setting. In the process, we show that the derived category with nilpotent cohomology is equivalent to the derived category of nilpotent modules over the preprojective algebra.</description>

      <title>Categorical Cell Decomposition of Quantized Symplectic Algebraic Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:1311.6804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new symplectic analogue of Kashiwara's Equivalence from D-module theory. As a consequence, we establish a structure theory for module categories over deformation quantizations that mirrors, at a higher categorical level, the Bialynicki-Birula stratification of a variety with an action of the multiplicative group. The resulting categorical cell decomposition provides an algebro-geometric parallel to the structure of Fukaya categories of Weinstein manifolds. From it, we derive concrete consequences for invariants such as K-theory and Hochschild homology of module categories of interest in geometric representation theory.</description>

Abstract: We study zero-cycles in families of rationally connected varieties. We show that for a smooth projective scheme over a henselian discrete valuation ring the restriction of relative zero cycles to the special fiber induces an isomorphism on Chow groups if the special fiber is separably rationally connected. We further extend this result to certain higher Chow groups and develop conjectures in the non-smooth case. Our main results generalise a result of Koll\'ar [31].</description>

      <title>The Dirac-Higgs complex and categorification of (BBB)-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,G)$ denote the hyperk\"ahler moduli space of $G$-Higgs bundles over a smooth projective curve $X$. In the context of four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, Kapustin and Witten introduced the notion of (BBB)-brane: boundary conditions that are compatible with the B-model twist in every complex structure of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,G)$. The geometry of such branes was initially proposed to be hyperk\"ahler submanifolds that support a hyperholomorphic bundle. Gaiotto has suggested a more general type of (BBB)-brane defined by perfect analytic complexes on the Deligne-Hitchin twistor space $\mathrm{Tw}(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,G))$.
  Following Gaiotto's suggestion, this paper proposes a framework for the categorification of (BBB)-branes, both on the moduli spaces and on the corresponding derived moduli stacks. We do so by introducing the Deligne stack, a derived analytic stack with corresponding moduli space $\mathrm{Tw}(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,G))$, defined as a gluing between two analytic Hodge stacks along the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. We then construct a class of (BBB)-branes using integral functors that arise from higher non-abelian Hodge theory, before discussing their relation to the Wilson functors from the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine and generalize the results of K. E. Lauter and E. W. Howe on principal polarizations on products of abelian varieties over finite fields. Firstly, we study the reasons for the absence of an irreducible principal polarization in the isogeny class of the product of an ordinary and a supersingular abelian variety. Secondly, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of a principal polarization on an abelian variety in the isogeny class of the product of a geometrically simple abelian surface and an elliptic curve. As an application we get that this abelian threefold or its quadratic twist is a Jacobian.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring, $k(\eta)$ its fraction field, $S={\rm Spec} R$, $(G_{\eta},\mathcal{L}_{\eta})$ a polarized abelian variety over $k(\eta)$ with $\mathcal{L}_{\eta}$ symmetric ample cubical and $\mathcal{G}$ the N\'eron model of $G_{\eta}$ over $S$. Suppose that $\mathcal{G}$ is semiabelian over $S$. Then there exists a {\it unique} relative compactification $(P,\mathcal{N})$ of $\mathcal{G}$ such that ($\alpha$) $P$ is Cohen-Macaulay with codim$_P(P\setminus\mathcal{G})=2$ and ($\beta$) $\mathcal{N}$ is ample invertible with $\mathcal{N}_{|\mathcal{G}}$ cubical and $\mathcal{N}_{\eta} = \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}_{\eta}$ for some positive integer $n$. The totally degenerate case has been studied in \cite{MN24}. We discuss here first the partially degenerate case and then the case where $R$ is a Dedekind domain.</description>

Abstract: We define the minimal plus-one generated curves and prove a result explaining why they are the closest relatives of the free curves, after the nearly free curves. Then we look at the projective closures of the general and of the special fibers of some Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials constructed by E. Artal Bartolo, Pi. Cassou-Nogu\`es and I. Luengo Velasco. They yield new examples of free, nearly free or minimal plus-one generated curves.

      <title>Reality conditions for the KdV equation and exact quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper reality conditions for quasi-periodic solutions of the KdV equation are determined completely. As a result, solutions in the form of non-linear waves can be plotted and investigated.
  The full scope of obtaining finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation is presented. It is proven that the multiply periodic $\wp_{1,1}$-function on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve of arbitrary genus serves as the finite-gap solution, the genus coincides with the number of gaps. The subspace of the Jacobian variety where $\wp_{1,1}$, as well as other $\wp$-functions, are bounded and real-valued is found in any genus. This result covers every finite phase space of the KdV hierarchy, and can be extended to other completely integrable equations. A method of effective computation of this type of solutions is suggested, and illustrated in genera $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>The image complexity of an analytic map germ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The image of a holomorphic map germ is not necessarily locally open, and it is not always well-defined as a set germ. We find the structure of what becomes the image of a map germ when the target is a surface. We encode it as a decorated tree and we derive a complexity degree.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} simplicial toric variety. We further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>An example of the Jantzen filtration of a D-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Jantzen filtration of a D-module on the flag variety of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. At each step in the computation, we illustrate the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-module structure on global sections to give an algebraic picture of this geometric computation. We conclude by showing that the Jantzen filtration on the D-module agrees with the algebraic Jantzen filtration on its global sections, demonstrating a famous theorem of Beilinson--Bernstein.</description>

      <title>Orbit structures and complexity in Schubert and Richardson Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide a type-uniform formula for the torus complexity of the usual torus action on a Richardson variety, by developing the notion of algebraic dimensions of Bruhat intervals, strengthening a type $A$ result by Donten-Bury, Escobar and Portakal. In the process, we give an explicit description of the torus action on any Deodhar component as well as describe the root subgroups that comprise the component. Secondly, when a Levi subgroup in a reductive algebraic group acts on a Schubert variety, we exhibit a codimension preserving bijection between the Levi-Borel subgroup (a Borel subgroup in the Levi subgroup) orbits in the big open cell of that Schubert variety and torus orbits in the big open cell of a distinguished Schubert subvariety. This bijection has many applications including a type-uniform formula for the Levi-Borel complexity of the usual Levi-Borel subgroup action on a Schubert variety. We conclude by extending the Levi-Borel complexity results to a large class of Schubert varieties in the partial flag variety.</description>

      <title>Odd and Even Elliptic Curves with Complex Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an order $O$ in a quadratic field $K$ odd (resp. even) if its discriminant is an odd (resp. even) integer. We call an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $C$ of complex numbers with CM odd (resp. even) if its endomorphism ring $End(E)$ is an odd (resp. even) order in the corresponding imaginary quadratic field.
  Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties.
  1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$;
  2) $j(E')$ is a real number;
  3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$.
  We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even).
  This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.</description>

      <title>Dualities and Categorical Structures from 2D Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental step towards studying string theory vacua, and, ultimately, their stability, is that of understanding the underlying mathematical structure of the QFT resulting from its dimensional reduction on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, the latter being complex manifolds admitting a category theory description. The present work aims at addressing this question in the case of lower-dimensional gravitating systems, and supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, highlighting the role played by dualities and categorical structures towards studying analytical structures of amplitudes. (Based on the author's PhD thesis.

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>
