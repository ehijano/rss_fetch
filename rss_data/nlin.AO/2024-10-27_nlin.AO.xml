      <title>Kuramoto Oscillators With Asymmetric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of coupled oscillators of the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto type with interactions including a phase delay. We consider the case of a coupling matrix such that oscillators with large natural frequencies drive all slower ones but not the reverse. This scheme is inspired by Hebbian learning in neuroscience. We propose a simple model which is partly solvable analytically and shows many unusual features. For example, for the case of phase delay $\pi/2$ (a symmetric phase response curve) with symmetric coupling there is no synchronous behavior. But in the asymmetric coupling case, there are phase-locked states, i.e., states where many oscillators have the same frequency, but with substantial phase differences.</description>

      <title>Evolving Neural Networks Reveal Emergent Collective Behavior from Minimal Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems is critical for advancing fields such as swarm robotics and artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigate how neural networks evolve to control agents' behavior in a dynamic environment, focusing on the relationship between the network's complexity and collective behavior patterns. By performing quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that the degree of network non-linearity correlates with the complexity of emergent behaviors. Simpler behaviors, such as lane formation and laminar flow, are characterized by more linear network operations, while complex behaviors like swarming and flocking show highly non-linear neural processing. Moreover, specific environmental parameters, such as moderate noise, broader field of view, and lower agent density, promote the evolution of non-linear networks that drive richer, more intricate collective behaviors. These results highlight the importance of tuning evolutionary conditions to induce desired behaviors in multi-agent systems, offering new pathways for optimizing coordination in autonomous swarms. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how neural mechanisms influence collective dynamics, with implications for the design of intelligent, self-organizing systems.</description>

      <title>Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>
