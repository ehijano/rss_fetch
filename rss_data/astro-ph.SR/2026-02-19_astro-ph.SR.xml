      <title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. III. Comparison between Starspot Mapping, Zeeman Doppler Imaging, and Multiwavelength Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simultaneous multiwavelength observations of a nearby young solar-type star EK Dra in the optical, H$\alpha$ spectrum, and X-ray, have provided evidence for stellar prominence eruptions associated with superflares. The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$\alpha$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$\alpha$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$\alpha$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars: Convection, Mass Loss, Nucleosynthesis, and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first stars likely formed from pristine clouds, marking a transformative epoch after the dark ages by initiating reionisation and synthesising the first heavy elements. Among these, low-mass Population III stars are of particular interest, as their long lifespans raise the possibility that some may survive to the present day in the Milky Way's stellar halo or satellite dwarfs. As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ionospheric TEC Variations in Solar and Geomagnetic Influences Across Solar Activity Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the variability of ionospheric total electron content (VTEC) in response to solar and geomagnetic drivers across solar cycles 23 to 25. While the dominant effect of solar radiation on VTEC is well-known, a comprehensive understanding of how these relationships and their time-lags vary across distinct solar cycle phases and across cycles of differing intensity has been lacking. Using global VTEC data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Global Ionospheric Maps (CASG) and solar-geophysical indices from NASA's OMNI dataset spanning from 1998 to 2025, this study bridges that gap by quantifying correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and parameters such as $F_{10.7}$ solar flux, R sunspot number, Kp, Ap, and Dst indices, and solar wind properties. Results show that solar proxies, particularly $F_{10.7}$ and R sunspot number, exhibit the strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, with a characteristic $\sim2$-day lag attributed to thermospheric oxygen dynamics and ionospheric recombination processes. In contrast, geomagnetic indices exhibit weaker and phase-dependent correlations, while direct correlations between solar wind parameters and global VTEC are weak, as their influence is primarily mediated by geomagnetic activity and exhibits strong regional and temporal heterogeneity. Phase-resolved analyses further reveal that geomagnetic activity plays a more prominent role during transitional phases, while maximum and minimum periods are dominated by EUV variability and non-solar drivers, respectively. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating solar phase and time-lag dependencies in ionospheric modelling and forecasting efforts.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting the sunward electron deficit: Implications for solar wind acceleration and core population formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.</description>

      <title>Propagation Characteristics of the April 21, 2023 CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for predicting their geoeffectiveness. Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model</description>

      <title>Localized $^{18}$O production in white dwarf mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of a He white dwarf (WD) and a CO WD is the favored formation channel for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. These stars exhibit ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios that are orders of magnitude lower than the solar value. However, it is not fully understood whether such low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios can be achieved in WD merger remnants for the predicted lifetime of RCB stars of around $10^4\,\mathrm{years}$. In this work, we perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations of a 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a merger of a $0.3\,M_\odot$ He WD and a $0.6\,M_\odot$ CO WD for $4000\,\mathrm{s}$ at which point a steady state in temperature and density is reached. From this point, we follow several radial zones to study the long-term production of ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ and its variability throughout the burning region.
  We find that the asymmetric merger process leaves an imprint on the distribution of the abundances at the end of our hydrodynamic simulation. During the long-term evolution up to $100\,\mathrm{years}$, we observe ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios of order of unity, although the timescale on which ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ is destroyed again is highly location dependent. Importantly, our calculations suggest that in the outer layers of the burning shell, the dominant production channel is $^{14}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ instead of the commonly considered $^{14}\mathrm{N}(\alpha,\gamma)^{18}\mathrm{F}(\beta^+)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ reaction, whereby the former can be sustained for longer periods of time. Furthermore, these outer regions do not reach the conditions necessary for fast $\alpha$-captures in ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ to ${^{22}}\mathrm{Ne}$, thus being favorable to maintaining a low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A protostellar disk is threaded by a static magnetic field that is perpendicular to the disk-surface. The magnetic field acts to brake the protostellar disk and cause the disk material to move towards the protostar. General analytic equations are derived for the accretion speed, and mass accretion rate. Simplified analytic equations are also obtained for the disk energy dissipation, accretion timescale and the disk radial position plus disk surface density, as a function of time. In addition to providing physical insight, such equations might be useful as a check on computational models for protostar and protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>The role of radiative torques in the molecular cloud core L43</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized emission from interstellar dust grains is commonly used to infer information about the underlying magnetic field from the diffuse interstellar medium to molecular cloud cores. Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 \mu\mathrm{m}$ and $850 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $\mu\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field.</description>

      <title>New self-consistent theoretical descriptions for mass-loss rates of O-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars.</description>

      <title>Searching for White Dwarf Candidates Formed Through Binary evolution in Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), the evolutionary endpoints of most stars, can form through both single-star and binary channels. While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>Investigating Nonlinear Quenching Effects on Polar Field Buildup in the Sun Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\Delta D_{\mathrm{LQ}}/\Delta D_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</description>

      <title>Orbital Motions of Binaries in Orion South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-angular resolution ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}06$) VLA and ALMA observations of Orion South separated by 15.52 years. The purpose of this study was to search for orbital motions in three close ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}1$) binary systems in the region. We do not detect changes in the position angle of the binaries but in two of the cases we detect significant changes in their separation in the plane of the sky. We use these changes to estimate that the total mass of the binaries is in the $\simeq$1-2 $M_\odot$ range. We also estimate the disk masses from the mm emission. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is in the range of 0.04 to 0.18, values consistent with those expected for very early stellar evolution (Class 0) protostars.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Globular Clusters in Formation</title>

Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Near Galactic Centre: A Comprehensive Study of Bulge OCs HSC 25, HSC 37, HSC 2878 Utilising Gaia DR3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.</description>

      <title>CHARA Array Delay Lines: Upgrades, Performance and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long baseline optical and infrared interferometric arrays achieve high angular resolution and enable detailed astrophysical measurements. Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling. This paper is a reference for current and future use of the CHARA Array and for next-generation instrument design.</description>

      <title>Molecular diagnostics for the mid-infrared emission of planet-forming disks. Carbon and oxygen elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared observations of planet-forming disks reveal a wide diversity in molecular spectra. Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as $\rm H_2O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm OH$. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm CO_2$) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as $\rm CO_2$/$\rm H_2O$ and $\rm H_2O$/$\rm C_2H_2$ - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Major Solar Flares Using Interpretable Class-dependent Reward Framework with Active Region Magnetograms and Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.</description>

      <title>StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for 3D Protostellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables 3D simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit two-moment M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon-number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional 1D models. This RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic 3D environments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations with the MURaM Code: the Emergence of Active Region 11158 and the X2.2 Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code to the extensively studied flare-productive active region 11158. We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment.</description>

      <title>JOYS: JWST MIRI/MRS spectra of the inner 500 au region of the L1527 IRS bipolar outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study characterized the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identified emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyzed their spatial morphology using line-integrated intensity maps. We derived gas temperatures and column densities through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate-velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double-peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. A radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high-velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The coexistence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggests that L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical of its early evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics of Escaping Secondary Atmospheres May Shape the Cosmic Shoreline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>Can GW231123 have a stellar origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+23}_{-18} M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50} M_\odot$ -- in the range of the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160\,M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90\% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We allow for differential rotation to explore the high-spin regime. In this limit of weak angular momentum transport, we find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing an important correlation between masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

Abstract: Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.</description>
