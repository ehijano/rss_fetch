      <title>Non-Wiener groups with a Gelfand pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a non-amenable locally compact group and $K$ a compact subgroup of $G$ such that $(G,K)$ is a Gelfand pair. We show that if $G$ admits a suitable boundary representation which is topologically irreducible and not unitarizable, then $G$ is not a Wiener group in the sense that its Fourier transform does not satisfy the analogue of Wiener's Tauberian theorem. As an application, we show that if $G$ is a closed non-compact boundary transitive group of automorphisms of a connected locally finite graph with infinitely many ends, or a split reductive algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field, then $G$ is not Wiener.</description>

      <title>Order automorphisms of effect algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elegant description of the general form of order automorphisms of effect algebras has been known in the complex case. We present a much simpler proof based on the projective geometry which works also in the real case. As an application we classify order isomorphic pairs of matrix intervals and describe the general form of order isomorphisms for any pair of isomorphic matrix intervals.</description>

      <title>Linear preserver problems in matrix positivity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear preserver problems have been a central focus of research in matrix theory and operator theory for more than a century, beginning with Frobenius' 1897 characterization of determinant preserving linear maps on the space of complex matrices. Since this foundational result, considerable work has examined linear preservers of diverse subsets, functions, and relations across different matrix and operator spaces. The purpose of this survey is to present the current state of research on linear preserver problems for several positivity classes of matrices. We provide an overview of recent developments in the literature and, for each positivity class considered, identify gaps that remain to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Oppenheim--Schur inequalities for causal products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a class of Oppenheim--Schur-type inequalities for the convolutional Jury product of positive semidefinite matrices. These results extend to a causal convolutional setting the classical Schur and Oppenheim inequalities associated with the Hadamard product. Our approach highlights structural parallels between entrywise and convolution-based matrix operations, revealing how positivity constraints interact with causality. Building on this perspective, we introduce a broader family of causal matrix products and prove unified inequalities that simultaneously recover the classical Schur and Oppenheim bounds as well as their convolutional Jury counterparts. These results provide a common framework for understanding positivity-preserving matrix products and suggest further connections between classical matrix analysis and causal operator structures.</description>

      <title>A coherent theory of tent spaces and homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a scale of tent spaces that characterizes homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\mathrm{\dot F}^{\beta}_{p,q}$. These spaces generalize the classical spaces of Coifman, Meyer, and Stein, and are shown to be equivalent to the weighted tent spaces with Whitney averages developed by Huang. We show that these tent spaces follow a functional analytic theory that mirrors that of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, including duality, embeddings, discrete characterizations, John-Nirenberg-type properties, as well as real and complex interpolation. Furthermore, we provide a novel characterization of the endpoint spaces $\mathrm{\dot F}^\beta_{\infty,q}$, completing earlier work by Auscher, Bechtel, and the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we completely classify invariant subspaces of finite-rank perturbations of a class of Toeplitz operators on vector-valued Hardy spaces. As a consequence, in the vector-valued setting, we characterize invariant and almost invariant subspaces of a class of Toeplitz operators, as well as nearly invariant subspaces associated with certain Blaschke-based operators. We further treat the finite defect case for these nearly invariant subspaces.</description>

      <title>On measures derived from orbital integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose a novel framework to derive piecewise polynomial measures which result from invariant measures on adjoint orbits in the general context of compact and semi-simple Lie groups. The measures are computed from orbital integrals by a series of transformations on spaces of polynomials endowed with the apolar inner product. In the case of the unitary group we give a formula for the moments of the projection of an orbital measure.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Asplund and Tame Functionals using Arens Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between Arens products on the bidual of a Banach algebra and structural regularity properties of functionals on the algebra. Building on the classical characterization of weakly almost periodic functionals via Arens regularity, we prove new analogous criteria for Asplund and tame functionals.
  We establish a systematic correspondence between geometric properties of orbit sets in the dual -- namely weak compactness, fragmentability, and absence of $\ell^1$-sequences -- and structural properties of the corresponding bidual orbits under the Arens products, such as weak compactness, separability, and co-tameness. In particular, we obtain bidual characterizations of right Asplund and right tame functionals analogous to the classical weakly almost periodic theory.
  As an application, we specialize the theory to the group algebra $L^{1}(G)$ of a locally compact group $G$. In this setting, we derive concrete characterizations of Asplund and tame elements of $L^{\infty}(G)$ using orbits of finitely additive $\{0, 1\}$-valued measures. For characteristic functions over second-countable groups, this yields a simple orbit-countability criterion, generalizing a result of Glasner and Megrelishvili for $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem of the Lorentzian Dirac operator with APS boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with timelike boundary and show well-posedness of the Cauchy initial-boundary value problem coupled to APS-boundary conditions. This is achieved by deriving suitable energy estimates, which play a fundamental role in establishing uniqueness and existence of weak solutions. Finally, by introducing suitable mollifier operators, we study the differentiability of the solutions. For obtaining smoothness we need additional technical conditions.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Parabolic noncommutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called "bad Kasparov products". Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Why High-rank Neural Networks Generalize?: An Algebraic Framework with RKHSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.</description>

      <title>Center Manifolds and Normal Forms for Nonlinearly Periodically Forced DDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an effective framework for analysing bifurcations of equilibria in nonlinearly periodically forced delay differential equations. First, we establish the existence of a periodic smooth finite-dimensional center manifold near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium using the rigorous functional analytic framework of dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). Second, we construct a center manifold parametrization that allows us to describe the local dynamics on the center manifold near the equilibrium in terms of periodically forced normal forms. Third, we present a normalization method to derive explicit computational formulas for the critical normal form coefficients at a bifurcation of interest. In particular, we obtain such formulas for the periodically forced fold and nonresonant Hopf bifurcation. Several examples and indications from the literature confirm the validity and effectiveness of our approach.</description>
