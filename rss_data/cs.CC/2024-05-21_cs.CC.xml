      <title>Fixed-parameter tractability of canonical polyadic decomposition over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple proof that finding a rank-$R$ canonical polyadic decomposition of 3-dimensional tensors over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $R$ and $\mathbb{F}$. We also show some more concrete upper bounds on the time complexity of this problem.</description>

      <title>Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inner-approximate reachability analysis involves calculating subsets of reachable sets, known as inner-approximations. This analysis is crucial in the fields of dynamic systems analysis and control theory as it provides a reliable estimation of the set of states that a system can reach from given initial states at a specific time instant. In this paper, we study the inner-approximate reachability analysis problem based on the set-boundary reachability method for systems modelled by ordinary differential equations, in which the computed inner-approximations are represented with zonotopes. The set-boundary reachability method computes an inner-approximation by excluding states reached from the initial set's boundary. The effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the efficient extraction of the exact boundary of the initial set. To address this, we propose methods leveraging boundary and tiling matrices that can efficiently extract and refine the exact boundary of the initial set represented by zonotopes. Additionally, we enhance the exclusion strategy by contracting the outer-approximations in a flexible way, which allows for the computation of less conservative inner-approximations. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods against a series of benchmarks. The numerical results demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also accurate in computing inner-approximations.</description>

      <title>Noise-tolerant learnability of shallow quantum circuits from statistics and the cost of quantum pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the learnability of unknown quantum circuits in the near term. We prove the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes and provide an efficient way to benchmark various classes of noise from statistics, which gives us a powerful framework for developing noise-tolerant algorithms. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting with a small overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case lower bounds for learning random quantum circuits of logarithmic and higher depths within diamond distance with statistical queries. Additionally, we show the hardness of the quantum threshold search problem from quantum statistical queries and discuss its implications for the learnability of shallow quantum circuits. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher and proving a new variation of the quantum no-free lunch theorem.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of symmetric vs. functional PCSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ is largely unknown, even for symmetric $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, except for the case when $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are Boolean.
  First, we establish a dichotomy for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ where $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}$ are symmetric, $\mathbf{B}$ is functional (i.e. any $r-1$ elements of an $r$-ary tuple uniquely determines the last one), and $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ satisfies technical conditions we introduce called dependency and additivity. This result implies a dichotomy for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ with $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$ symmetric and $\mathbf{B}$ functional if (i) $\mathbf{A}$ is Boolean, or (ii) $\mathbf{A}$ is a hypergraph of a small uniformity, or (iii) $\mathbf{A}$ has a relation $R^{\mathbf{A}}$ of arity at least 3 such that the hypergraph diameter of $(A, R^{\mathbf{A}})$ is at most 1.
  Second, we show that for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$, where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ contain a single relation, $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies a technical condition called balancedness, and $\mathbf{B}$ is arbitrary, the combined basic linear programming relaxation (BLP) and the affine integer programming relaxation (AIP) is no more powerful than the (in general strictly weaker) AIP relaxation. Balanced $\mathbf{A}$ include symmetric $\mathbf{A}$ or, more generally, $\mathbf{A}$ preserved by a transitive permutation group.</description>

      <title>Partial gathering of mobile agents in dynamic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the partial gathering problem of mobile agents in synchronous dynamic bidirectional ring networks. When k agents are distributed in the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive integer g (&lt; k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at least g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering problem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start considering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider this problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring may be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the relationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the solvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of the proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the g-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k &lt;= 2g. Second, we show that the problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log g) moves when 2g + 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 8g - 4, the move complexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(gn) moves when k &gt;= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering problem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k &gt;= 2g + 1. In addition, agents require a total number of \Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp., total) gathering problem. Thus, when k &gt;= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial gathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an extremely classic NP-complete problem: How to determine if a graph G, where each vertex has a degree of at most 4, can be 3-colorable(The research in this paper focuses on graphs G that satisfy the condition where the degree of each vertex does not exceed 4. To conserve space, it is assumed throughout the paper that graph G meets this condition by default.). The author has meticulously observed the relationship between the coloring problem and semidefinite programming, and has creatively constructed the corresponding semidefinite programming problem R(G) for a given graph G. The construction method of R(G) refers to Theorem 1.1 in the paper. I have obtained and proven the conclusion: A graph G is 3-colorable if and only if the objective function of its corresponding optimization problem R(G) is bounded, and when the objective function is bounded, its minimum value is 0.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of An Election Game of Two or More Parties: How Bad Can It Be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14405v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An election campaign among two or more parties can be viewed as a game of two or more players, each of which has its own candidates as the pure strategies. People, as voters, comprise supporters for each party, and a candidate brings utility for the supporters of each party. Each party nominates exactly one of its candidates to compete against the other party's. A candidate is assumed to win the election with greater or equal odds if it brings more utility for all the people. The payoff of each player is the expected utility that its supporters get. The game is egoistic if every candidate benefits its party's supporters more than any candidate from a competing party does. In this paper, we first prove that it is NP-complete to determine whether an election game in a succinct representation, which is called the general form, has a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium even if it is egoistic. Next, we propose a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of an egoistic election game and show that a naive constant time algorithm leads to a (1+e)-approximate pure-strategy Nash equilibrium when the winning probability is computed by a softmax function. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, we show that the price of anarchy for egoistic election games is upper bounded by the number of parties. Our results suggest that an election becomes unpredictable in terms of stability and efficiency when more than two parties are involved, and, to some extent, also provides supporting arguments for why the two-party system is prevalent in democratic countries.</description>

      <title>A Smoothed FPTAS for Equilibria in Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for computing equilibria in congestion games, under smoothed running-time analysis. More precisely, we prove that if the resource costs of a congestion game are randomly perturbed by independent noises, whose density is at most $\phi$, then any sequence of $(1+\varepsilon)$-improving dynamics will reach an $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) after an expected number of steps which is strongly polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\phi$, and the size of the game's description. Our results establish a sharp contrast to the traditional worst-case analysis setting, where it is known that better-response dynamics take exponentially long to converge to $\alpha$-approximate PNE, for any constant factor $\alpha\geq 1$. As a matter of fact, computing $\alpha$-approximate PNE in congestion games is PLS-hard.
  We demonstrate how our analysis can be applied to various different models of congestion games including general, step-function, and polynomial cost, as well as fair cost-sharing games (where the resource costs are decreasing). It is important to note that our bounds do not depend explicitly on the cardinality of the players' strategy sets, and thus the smoothed FPTAS is readily applicable to network congestion games as well.</description>

      <title>On Probabilistic and Causal Reasoning with Summation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ibeling et al. (2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of causation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning (specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as difficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its merely probabilistic or "correlational" counterpart. Introducing a summation operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the $do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization. We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023).</description>
