      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barab\'asi-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.</description>

      <title>Better late, then? The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in Path DB, passengers fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</description>

      <title>On Separating Path and Tree Systems in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the concept of separating systems of vertex sets of graphs. A separating system of a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that for any pair of distinct elements in $X$, there exists a set in the separating system that contains exactly one of the two elements. A separating system of the vertex set of a graph $G$ is called a vertex-separating path (tree) system of $G$ if the elements of the separating system are paths (trees) in the graph $G$. In this paper, we focus on the size of the smallest vertex-separating path (tree) system for different types of graphs, including trees, grids, and maximal outerplanar graphs.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two variants of the induced subgraph isomorphism problem for two independent binomial random graphs with constant edge-probabilities p_1,p_2. In particular, (i) we prove a sharp threshold result for the appearance of G_{n,p_1} as an induced subgraph of G_{N,p_2}, (ii) we show two-point concentration of the size of the maximum common induced subgraph of G_{N, p_1} and G_{N,p_2}, and (iii) we show that the number of induced copies of G_{n,p_1} in G_{N,p_2} has an unusual limiting distribution.
  These results confirm simulation-based predictions of McCreesh, Prosser, Solnon and Trimble, and resolve several open problems of Chatterjee and Diaconis. The proofs are based on careful refinements of the first and second moment method, using extra twists to (a) take some non-standard behaviors into account, and (b) work around the large variance issues that prevent standard applications of these methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond hypergraph acyclicity: limits of tractability for pseudo-Boolean optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing a polynomial function with literals over all binary points, often referred to as pseudo-Boolean optimization. We investigate the fundamental limits of computation for this problem by providing new necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for tractability. On the one hand, we obtain the first intractability results, in the best-case sense, for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems on signed hypergraphs with bounded rank, in terms of the treewidth of the intersection graph. Namely, first, under some mild assumptions, we show that for every sequence of hypergraphs indexed by the treewidth and with bounded rank, the complexity of solving the associated pseudo-Boolean optimization problem grows super-polynomially in the treewidth. Second, we show that any hypergraph of bounded rank is the underlying hypergraph of some signed hypergraph for which the corresponding pseudo-Boolean polytope has an exponential extension complexity in the treewidth. On the other hand, we introduce the nest-set gap, a new hypergraph-theoretic notion that enables us to define a notion of "distance" from the hypergaph acyclicity. We prove that if this distance is bounded, the pseudo-Boolean polytope admits a polynomial-size extended formulation. This in turn enables us to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for a large class of pseudo-Boolean optimization problems whose underlying hypergraphs contain beta-cycles.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimizers: Improving Training with One Line of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a single-line modification in Pytorch to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47$ times, but also better results in LLM post-training tasks.
