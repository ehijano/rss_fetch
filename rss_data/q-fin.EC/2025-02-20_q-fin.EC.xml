      <title>The Policy Paradox: Government Debt Servicing and Local Bank Risk Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of local government debt is widely recognized as one of the "gray rhinos" affecting the stable development of China's economy. Government debt can transmit risks to local banks, which are among the primary holders of local debt, thereby triggering systemic financial risks. Consequently, exploring debt resolution pathways and evaluating the systematic effects of debt servicing policies has become critically important. This study employs panel data from 348 local commercial banks across 29 provincial-level administrative regions in China from 2010 to 2023, and constructs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to investigate the impact of the State Council's special supervision of debt servicing on local bank risks. The findings indicate that the government's debt servicing policy essentially represents a shift of government debt from explicit to implicit forms, significantly increasing the risks faced by local banks and producing outcomes contrary to the policy's original intent. This effect is particularly pronounced for rural commercial banks and banks with high customer concentration and fewer branches. Mechanism analysis reveals two key insights. First, local banks are heavily influenced by local government control; the government's debt servicing requires banks to support the government by purchasing government bonds and other financial instruments, which leads to a deterioration in asset quality and an expansion of risk exposure. Second, government debt crowds out private credit from local banks, weakening the region's repayment capacity and ultimately increasing bank risk. Our research uncovers the counterintuitive effects of government debt servicing and offers corresponding policy recommendations.</description>

      <title>BeforeIT.jl: High-Performance Agent-Based Macroeconomics Made Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BeforeIT is an open-source software for building and simulating state-of-the-art macroeconomic agent-based models (macro ABMs) based on the recently introduced macro ABM developed in [1] and here referred to as the base model. Written in Julia, it combines extraordinary computational efficiency with user-friendliness and extensibility. We present the main structure of the software, demonstrate its ease of use with illustrative examples, and benchmark its performance. Our benchmarks show that the base model built with BeforeIT is orders of magnitude faster than a Matlab version, and significantly faster than Matlab-generated C code. BeforeIT is designed to facilitate reproducibility, extensibility, and experimentation. As the first open-source, industry-grade software to build macro ABMs of the type of the base model, BeforeIT can significantly foster collaboration and innovation in the field of agent-based macroeconomic modelling. The package, along with its documentation, is freely available at https://github.com/bancaditalia/BeforeIT.jl under the AGPL-3.0.</description>

      <title>The Power of Linear Programming in Sponsored Listings Ranking: Evidence from Field Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sponsored listing is one of the major revenue sources for many prominent online marketplaces, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba. When consumers visit a marketplace's webpage for a specific item, in addition to that item, the marketplace might also display a ranked listing of sponsored items from various third-party sellers. These sellers are charged an advertisement fee if a user purchases any of the sponsored items from this listing. Determining how to rank these sponsored items for each incoming visit is a crucial challenge for online marketplaces, a problem known as sponsored listings ranking (SLR). The major difficulty of SLR lies in balancing the trade-off between maximizing the overall revenue and recommending high-quality and relevant ranked listings. While a more relevant ranking may result in more purchases and consumer engagement, the marketplace also needs to take account of the potential revenue when making ranking decisions. Due to the latency requirement and historical reasons, many online marketplaces use score-based ranking algorithms for SLR optimization. Alternatively, recent research also discusses obtaining the ranking by solving linear programming (LP). In this paper, we collaborate with a leading online global marketplace and conduct a series of field experiments to compare the performance of the score-based ranking algorithms and the LP-based algorithms. The field experiment lasted for $19$ days, which included $329.3$ million visits in total. We observed that the LP-based approach improved all major metrics by $1.80\%$ of revenue, $1.55\%$ of purchase, and $1.39\%$ of the gross merchandise value (GMV), compared to an extremely-tuned score-based algorithm that was previously used in production by the marketplace.</description>

      <title>Restricting Entries to All-Pay Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08104v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an all-pay contest in which players with low abilities are filtered out before competing for prizes. We consider a setting where the designer admits a certain number of top players. The admitted players update their beliefs based on the signal that their abilities are among the top, which leads to posterior beliefs that, even under i.i.d. priors, are correlated and depend on each player's private ability. We find that all effects of this elimination mechanism -- including the reduction in the number of admitted players and the resulting updated beliefs -- are captured by an inflated ability. A symmetric and strictly increasing equilibrium strategy exists if and only if this inflated ability is increasing in the player's true ability. Under this condition, we explicitly characterize the unique strictly increasing Bayesian equilibrium strategy. Focusing on a winner-take-all prize structure, we find that each admitted player's effort strictly decreases as the admitted number increases. As a result, it is optimal to admit only two players in terms of maximizing the expected highest effort. Finally, in a two-stage extension, we find that there does not exist a symmetric and strictly increasing equilibrium strategy.</description>

      <title>Regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to estimate regression coefficients relating environmental variables, such as the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and -- because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs -- errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to regression coefficient estimation. PPI generates unbiased estimates by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.
