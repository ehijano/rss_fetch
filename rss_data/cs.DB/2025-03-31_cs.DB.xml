      <title>Taxonomy Inference for Tabular Data Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taxonomy inference for tabular data is a critical task of schema inference, aiming at discovering entity types (i.e., concepts) of the tables and building their hierarchy. It can play an important role in data management, data exploration, ontology learning, and many data-centric applications. Existing schema inference systems focus more on XML, JSON or RDF data, and often rely on lexical formats and structures of the data for calculating similarities, with limited exploitation of the semantics of the text across a table. Motivated by recent works on taxonomy completion and construction using Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper presents two LLM-based methods for taxonomy inference for tables: (i) EmTT which embeds columns by fine-tuning with contrastive learning encoder-alone LLMs like BERT and utilises clustering for hierarchy construction, and (ii) GeTT which generates table entity types and their hierarchy by iterative prompting using a decoder-alone LLM like GPT-4. Extensive evaluation on three real-world datasets with six metrics covering different aspects of the output taxonomies has demonstrated that EmTT and GeTT can both produce taxonomies with strong consistency relative to the Ground Truth.</description>

      <title>A Graph-native Optimization Framework for Complex Graph Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report extends the SIGMOD 2025 paper "A Modular Graph-Native Query Optimization Framework" by providing a comprehensive exposition of GOpt's advanced technical mechanisms, implementation strategies, and extended evaluations. While the original paper introduced GOpt's unified intermediate representation (GIR) and demonstrated its performance benefits, this report delves into the framework's implementation depth: (1) the full specification of GOpt's optimization rules; (2) a systematic treatment of semantic variations (e.g., homomorphism vs. edge-distinct matching) across query languages and their implications for optimization; (3) the design of GOpt's Physical integration interface, enabling seamless integration with transactional (Neo4j) and distributed (GraphScope) backends via engine-specific operator customization; and (4) a detailed analysis of plan transformations for LDBC benchmark queries.</description>

      <title>Shapley Revisited: Tractable Responsibility Measures for Query Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shapley value, originating from cooperative game theory, has been employed to define responsibility measures that quantify the contributions of database facts to obtaining a given query answer. For non-numeric queries, this is done by considering a cooperative game whose players are the facts and whose wealth function assigns 1 or 0 to each subset of the database, depending on whether the query answer holds in the given subset. While conceptually simple, this approach suffers from a notable drawback: the problem of computing such Shapley values is #P-hard in data complexity, even for simple conjunctive queries. This motivates us to revisit the question of what constitutes a reasonable responsibility measure and to introduce a new family of responsibility measures -- weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS) -- which satisfy intuitive properties. Interestingly, while the definition of WSMSs is simple and bears no obvious resemblance to the Shapley value formula, we prove that every WSMS measure can be equivalently seen as the Shapley value of a suitably defined cooperative game. Moreover, WSMS measures enjoy tractable data complexity for a large class of queries, including all unions of conjunctive queries. We further explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation and establish (in)tractability results for various subclasses of conjunctive queries.</description>

      <title>EllieSQL: Cost-Efficient Text-to-SQL with Complexity-Aware Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL automatically translates natural language queries to SQL, allowing non-technical users to retrieve data from databases without specialized SQL knowledge. Despite the success of advanced LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches on leaderboards, their unsustainable computational costs--often overlooked--stand as the "elephant in the room" in current leaderboard-driven research, limiting their economic practicability for real-world deployment and widespread adoption. To tackle this, we exploratively propose EllieSQL, a complexity-aware routing framework that assigns queries to suitable SQL generation pipelines based on estimated complexity. We investigate multiple routers to direct simple queries to efficient approaches while reserving computationally intensive methods for complex cases. Drawing from economics, we introduce the Token Elasticity of Performance (TEP) metric, capturing cost-efficiency by quantifying the responsiveness of performance gains relative to token investment in SQL generation. Experiments show that compared to always using the most advanced methods in our study, EllieSQL with the Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO router reduces token use by over 40% without compromising performance on Bird development set, achieving more than a 2x boost in TEP over non-routing approaches. This not only advances the pursuit of cost-efficient Text-to-SQL but also invites the community to weigh resource efficiency alongside performance, contributing to progress in sustainable Text-to-SQL.</description>

      <title>A logic-based framework for database repairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15516v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general abstract framework for database repairs, where the repair notions are defined using formal logic. We distinguish between integrity constraints and so-called query constraints. The former are used to model consistency and desirable properties of the data (such as functional dependencies and independencies), while the latter relate two database instances according to their answers to the query constraints. The framework allows for a distinction between hard and soft queries, allowing the answers to a core set of queries to be preserved, as well as defining a distance between instances based on query answers. We illustrate how different notions of repairs from the literature can be modelled within our unifying framework. The framework generalises both set-based and cardinality based repairs to semiring annotated databases. Furthermore, we initiate a complexity-theoretic analysis of consistent query answering and checking existence of a repair within the framework.</description>

      <title>CONCERTO: Complex Query Execution Mechanism-Aware Learned Cost Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing demand for massive data analysis, many DBMSs have adopted complex underlying query execution mechanisms, including vectorized operators, parallel execution, and dynamic pipeline modifications. However, there remains a lack of targeted Query Performance Prediction (QPP) methods for these complex execution mechanisms and their interactions, as most existing approaches focus on traditional tree-shaped query plans and static serial executors. To address this challenge, this paper proposes CONCERTO, a Complex query executiON meChanism-awaE leaRned cosT estimatiOn method. CONCERTO first establishes independent resource cost models for each physical operator. It then constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consisting of a dataflow tree backbone and resource competition relationships among concurrent operators. After calibrating the cost impact of parallel operator execution using Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with additional attention mechanisms, CONCERTO extracts and aggregates cost vector trees through Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), ultimately achieving effective query performance prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that CONCERTO achieves higher prediction accuracy than existing methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity. Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13 metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics. Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis, this file presents approximately one hundred million calculated paper-patent similarity pairs to enhance understanding of how theoretical advancements translate into commercial technologies. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Next Token Prediction For Optimizing Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Next Token Prediction paradigm (NTP, for short) lies at the forefront of modern large foundational models that are pre-trained on diverse and large datasets. These models generalize effectively and have proven to be very successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Inspired by the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate whether the same NTP paradigm can also be applied to DBMS design and optimization tasks. Adopting NTP directly for database optimization is non-trivial due to the fundamental differences between the domains. In this paper, we present a framework termed Probe and Learn (PoLe) for applying NTP to optimize database systems. PoLe leverages Decision Transformers and hardware-generated tokens to effectively incorporate NTP into database systems. Preliminary results from the main-memory index scheduling task demonstrate that adopting NTP can improve both performance and generalizability.</description>
