      <title>Stationary Reflection and the Failure OF SCH at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining stationary reflection (a compactness property) with the failure of SCH (an instance of non-compactness) has been a long-standing theme. We obtain this at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$, answering a question of Ben-Neria, Hayut, and Unger: We prove from the existence of uncountably many supercompact cardinals the consistency of $\aleph_{\omega_1}$ is strong limit together with $2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}&gt;\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$ and every stationary set of $\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$ reflects.</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including model theory, discrete geometry, and probability theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}$ be families of subspaces of $Y$. We define a two parameter family of numbers, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$, order $q$, VC-density of the pair \[ (\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}} = (\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}). \] The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0, q=1$. For $p=0, q &gt; 0$, we recover Shelah's notion of higher-order VC-density for $q$-dependent families. Our definition introduces a new notion when $p&gt;0$. Our main result establishes that that in any model of these theories \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] This result generalizes known VC-density bounds in these structures, extending them in multiple ways, as well as providing a uniform proof paradigm applicable to all of them. We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem. We show that with certain restrictions, these results extend to our higher-degree topological setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically spherical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of asymptotically spherical topological groups, which says that spheres of large radius with respect to any maximal length function are still spherical with respect to any other maximal length function. This is a strengthening of a related condition introduced by Sebastian Hurtado, which we call bounded eccentricity. Our main result is a partial characterization of which groups are asymptotically spherical, and we also give an example of a discrete, bounded eccentric group who fails to be asymptotically spherical.</description>

      <title>A Strategic Topology on Information Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two information structures are said to be close if, with high probability, there is approximate common knowledge that interim beliefs are close under the two information structures. We define an "almost common knowledge topology" reflecting this notion of closeness. We show that it is the coarsest topology generating continuity of equilibrium outcomes. An information structure is said to be simple if each player has a finite set of types and each type has a distinct first-order belief about payoff states. We show that simple information structures are dense in the almost common knowledge topology and thus it is without loss to restrict attention to simple information structures in information design problems.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}$-Rule Systems and Inductive Classes of G\"{o}del Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general theory of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for systems of intuitionistic and modal logic. We introduce the notions of $\Pi_{2}$-rule system and of an Inductive Class, and provide model-theoretic and algebraic completeness theorems, which serve as our basic tools. As an illustration of the general theory, we analyse the structure of inductive classes of G\"{o}del algebras, from a structure theoretic and logical point of view. We show that unlike other well-studied settings (such as logics, or single-conclusion rule systems), there are continuum many $\Pi_{2}$-rule systems extending $\mathsf{LC}=\mathsf{IPC}+(p\rightarrow q)\vee (q\rightarrow p)$, and show how our methods allow easy proofs of the admissibility of the well-known Takeuti-Titani rule. Our final results concern general questions admissibility in $\mathsf{LC}$: (1) we present a full classification of those inductive classes which are inductively complete, i.e., where all $\Pi_{2}$-rules which are admissible are derivable, and (2) show that the problem of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules over $\mathsf{LC}$ is decidable.</description>

      <title>On Ultrapowers and Cohesive Ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the Tukey order, the Galvin property/ Cohesive ultrafilters from \cite{Kanamori1978} in terms of ultrapowers. We use this characterization to measure the distance between the Tukey order and other well-known orders of ultrafilters. Secondly, we improve two theorems of Kanamori \cite{Kanamori1978} from the 70's. We then study the point spectrum and the depth spectrum of an ultrafilter, and give a simple positive answer to Kanamori's question \cite[Question 2]{Kanamori1978} starting from a supercompact cardinal. We also prove that a positive answer requires more than $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$. Finally, we prove several consistency results regarding the point and depth spectrum.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>
