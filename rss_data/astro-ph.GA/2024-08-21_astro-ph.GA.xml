      <title>Not-so-little Red Dots: Two massive and dusty starbursts at z~5-7 pushing the limits of star formation discovered by JWST in the COSMOS-Web survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the properties of two candidate massive ($M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) and dusty ($A_{\rm v}&gt;2.5$ mag) galaxies at $z=5-7$ in the first 0.28 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. One object is spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a robust $z_{\rm phot}=6.7\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors ($F277W-F444W\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection for the widely-studied ``little red dot" (LRD) population with the exception of their spatially-resolved morphologies. The morphology of our targets allows us to conclude that their red continuum is dominated by highly obscured stellar emission and not by reddened nuclear activity. Using a variety of SED-fitting tools and star formation histories, we estimate the stellar masses to be $\log(M_\star)=11.32^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$ $M_\odot$ and $\log(M_\star)=11.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_\odot$, respectively, with a red continuum emission dominated by a recent episode of star formation. We then compare their number density to the halo mass function to infer stellar baryon fractions of $\epsilon_\star\sim0.25$ and $\epsilon_\star\sim0.5$. Both are significantly higher than what is commonly observed in lower-z galaxies or more dust-obscured galaxies at similar redshifts. With very bright ultra-high-z Lyman-Break Galaxies and some non-AGN dominated LRDs, such ``extended" LRDs represent another population that may require very efficient star formation at early times.</description>

      <title>Project Dinos II: Redshift evolution of dark and luminous matter density profiles in strong-lensing elliptical galaxies across $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the dark and luminous matter distribution of massive elliptical galaxies, and their evolution with redshift, by combining strong lensing and dynamical observables. Our sample of 58 lens galaxies covers a redshift range of $0.090\leq z_{\rm l}\leq0.884$. By combining new Hubble Space Telescope imaging with previously observed velocity dispersion and line-of-sight measurements, we decompose the luminous matter profile from the dark matter profile and perform a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level properties of both profiles. We find that the inner slope of the dark matter density profile ("cusp"; $\rho_{\rm DM}\propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm in}}$) is slightly steeper ($\mu_{\gamma_{\rm in}}=1.18^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $z=0.35$ with $\leq0.16$ intrinsic scatter) than a standard Navarro$-$Frenk$-$White (NFW; $\gamma_{\rm in}=1$), with an appreciable evolution with redshift ($d\log(\gamma_{\rm in})/dz=-0.33\pm0.13$) and is consistent with NFW-like distributions at higher redshifts ($z\geq0.56$ for $\leq1\sigma$ consistency). Additionally, we find the stellar mass-to-light ratio at the population level consistent with that of a Salpeter initial mass function, a small stellar mass-to-light gradient ($\kappa_{*}(r)\propto r^{-\eta}$, with $\overline{\eta}\leq9.4\times10^{-3}$), and isotropic stellar orbits. Our averaged total mass density profile is consistent with a power-law profile within $0.25-4$ Einstein radii ($\overline{\gamma}=2.14\pm0.06$), with an internal mass-sheet transformation parameter $\overline{\lambda}=1.02\pm0.01$ consistent with no mass sheet. Our findings confirm the validity of the standard mass models used for time-delay cosmography. However, our results are in strong tension with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations such as IllustrisTNG, highlighting the need to better understand the formation of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Carousel Lens: A Well-Modeled Strong Lens with Multiple Lensed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years alone, the lensing community has discovered thousands of strong lens candidates, and spectroscopically confirmed hundreds of them. In this time of abundance, it becomes pragmatic to focus our time and resources on the few extraordinary systems, in order to most efficiently study the universe. In this paper, we present such a system: DESI-090.9854-35.9683, a cluster-scale lens at $z_{\rm l} = 0.49$, with seven observed lensed sources around the core, and additional lensed sources further out in the cluster. From the number and the textbook configuration of the lensed images, a tight constraint on the mass potential of the lens is possible. This would allow for detailed analysis on the dark and luminous matter content within galaxy clusters, as well as a probe into dark energy and high-redshift galaxies. We present our spatially resolved kinematic measurements of this system from the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, which confirm five of these source galaxies (in ascending order, at $z_{\rm s} = 0.962, 0.962, 1.166, 1.432,$ and $1.432$). With previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the F140W and F200LP bands, we also present a simple two power-law profile flux-based lens model that, for a cluster lens, well models the five lensed arc families with redshifts. We determine the mass to be $M(&lt; \theta_{\rm E}) = 4.78\times10^{13} M_{\odot}$ for the primary mass potential. From the model, we extrapolate the redshift of one of the two source galaxies not yet spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z_{\rm s}=4.52^{+1.03}_{-0.71}$.</description>

      <title>The All-Sky Impact of the LMC on the Milky Way Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) represents a large and recent disruption to the MW circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this work, we use idealized, hydrodynamical simulations of a MW-like CGM embedded in a live dark matter halo with an infalling LMC-like satellite initialized with its own CGM to understand how the encounter is shaping the global physical and kinematic properties of the MW CGM. First, we find that the LMC sources order-unity enhancements in MW CGM density, temperature, and pressure from a $\mathcal{M} \approx 2$ shock from the supersonic CGM-CGM collision, extending from the LMC to beyond $\sim R_{\rm 200, MW}$, enhancing column densities, X-ray brightness, the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) distortion, and potentially synchrotron emission from cosmic rays over large angular scales across the Southern Hemisphere. Second, the MW's reflex motion relative to its outer halo produces a dipole in CGM radial velocities, with $v_{\rm R} \pm 30-50$ km/s at $R &gt; 50$ kpc in the Northern/Southern hemispheres respectively, consistent with measurements in the stellar halo. Finally, ram pressure strips most of the LMC CGM gas by the present day, leaving $\sim 10^{8-9} M_{\odot}$ of warm, ionized gas along the past orbit of the LMC moving at high radial and/or tangential velocities $\sim 50-100$ kpc from the MW. Massive satellites like the LMC leave their mark on the CGM structure of their host galaxies, and signatures from this interaction may manifest in key all-sky observables of the CGM of the MW and other massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>An Extragalactic Widefield Search for Technosignatures with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common for surveys that are designed to find artificial signals generated by distant civilizations to focus on galactic sources. Recently, researchers have started focusing on searching for all other sources within the field observed, including the vast population of background galaxies. Toward a population of galaxies in the background toward the Vela supernova remnant, we search for technosignatures, spectral and temporal features consistent with our understanding of technology. We set transmitter power limits for the detection of signals in a population of over 1,300 galaxies within a single field of view observed with the Murchison Widefield Array.</description>

      <title>Testable predictions of outside-in age gradients in dwarf galaxies of all types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a sample of 73 simulated satellite and central dwarf galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{5.3}-10^{9.1} M_\odot$ to investigate the origin of their stellar age gradients. We find that dwarf galaxies often form their stars "inside-out," i.e., the stars form at successively larger radii over time. However, the oldest stars get reshuffled beyond the star forming radius by fluctuations in the gravitational potential well caused by stellar feedback (the same mechanisms that cause dwarfs to form dark matter cores). The result is that many dwarfs appear to have an "outside-in" age gradient at $z=0$, with younger stellar populations more centrally concentrated. However, for the reshuffled galaxies with the most extended star formation, young stars can form out to the large radii to which the old stars have been reshuffled, erasing the age gradient. We find that major mergers do not play a significant role in setting the age gradients of dwarfs. We find similar age gradient trends in satellites and field dwarfs, suggesting environment plays only a minor role, if any. Finally, we find that the age gradient trends are imprinted on the galaxies at later times, suggesting that the stellar reshuffling dominates after the galaxies have formed 50% of their stellar mass. The later reshuffling is at odds with results from the FIRE-2 simulations. Hence, age gradients offer a test of current star formation and feedback models that can be probed via observations of resolved stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Neural Infalling Cloud Equations (NICE): Increasing the Efficacy of Subgrid Models and Scientific Equation Discovery using Neural ODEs and Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well established that galactic systems are inherently multiphase, and that understanding the roles and interactions of the various phases is key towards a more complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution. For example, these interactions play a pivotal role in the cycling of baryons which fuels star formation. It remains a challenge that the transport and dynamics of cold clouds in their surrounding hot environment are governed by complex small scale processes (such as the interplay of turbulence and radiative cooling) that determine how the phases exchange mass, momentum and energy. Large scale models thus require subgrid prescriptions in the form of models validated on small scale simulations, which can take the form of a system of coupled differential equations. In this work, we explore using neural ordinary differential equations which embed a neural network as a term in the subgrid model to capture an uncertain physical process. We then apply Symbolic Regression on the learned model to potentially discover new insights into the physics of cloud-environment interactions. We test this on both generated mock data and actual simulation data. We also extend the neural ODE to include a secondary neural term. We show that neural ODEs in tandem with Symbolic Regression can be used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subgrid models, and/or discover the underlying equations to improve generality and scientific understanding. We highlight the potential of this scientific machine learning approach as a natural extension to the traditional modelling paradigm, both for the development of semi-analytic models and for physically interpretable equation discovery in complex non-linear systems.</description>

      <title>2-process Model and Residual Abundance Analysis of the Milky Way Massive Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``2-process Model'' is a promising technique for interpreting stellar chemical abundance data from large-scale surveys (e.g., SDSS-IV/V, GALAH), enabling more quantitative empirical studies of differences in chemical enrichment history between galaxies without relying on detailed yield and evolution models. In this work, we fit 2-process model parameters to (1) a luminous giant Milky Way (MW) sample and (2) stars comprising the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy (Sgr). We then use these two sets of model parameters to predict the abundances of 14 elements of stars belonging to the MW and in five of its massive satellite galaxies, analyzing the residuals between the predicted and observed abundances. We find that the model fit to (1) results in large residuals (0.1-0.3 dex) for most metallicity-dependent elements in the metal-rich ([Mg/H] $&gt;$ -0.8) stars of the satellite galaxies. However, the model fit to (2) results in small or no residuals for all elements across all satellite galaxies. Therefore, despite the wide variation in [X/Mg]-[Mg/H] abundance patterns of the satellite galaxies, the 2-process framework provides an accurate characterization of their abundance patterns across many elements, but these multi-element patterns are systematically different between the dwarf galaxy satellites and the MW disks. We consider a variety of scenarios for the origin of this difference, highlighting the possibility that a large inflow of pristine gas to the MW disk diluted the metallicity of star-forming gas without changing abundance ratios.</description>

      <title>A Big Red Dot: Scattered light, host galaxy signatures and multi-phase gas flows in a luminous, heavily reddened quasar at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep X-Shooter rest-frame UV to optical spectral analysis of the heavily reddened quasar, ULASJ2315+043 at z=2.566, known to reside in a major-merger host galaxy. The rest-frame optical is best-fit by a dust-reddened quasar E(B-V)_QSO = 1.55 with black-hole mass log10(Hbeta, MBH [M_sol]) = 10.26 +\- 0.05, bolometric luminosity L_Bol = 10^48.16 erg s^-1 and Eddington-scaled accretion rate log10(\lambda_Edd) = -0.19. We find remarkable similarities between ULASJ2315+043 and the high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs). The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionisation emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05% of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+043. Analysis of the mid infra-red SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption line systems in CIV, NV, SiIV and SiIII. There is evidence for significant high-velocity (&gt;1000 km s^-1) outflows in both the broad and narrow line regions as traced by CIV and [OIII] emission. The kinetic power of the [OIII] wind is e_ion = 10^44.61 erg s^-1 ~ 0.001 L_Bol. ULASJ2315+043 is likely in an important transition phase where star formation, black-hole accretion and multi-phase gas flows are simultaneously occurring.</description>

      <title>The GT and GHC models for molecular clouds compared. Differences, similarities, and myths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed comparison between the ``gravoturbulent'' (GT) and ``global hierarchical collapse'' (GHC) models for molecular clouds and star formation, their respective interpretations of the observational data, the features they share, and suggested tests and observations to discern between them. Also, we clarify common misconceptions in recent literature about the global and hierarchical nature of the GHC scenario, and briefly discuss the evolution of some aspects of both models toward convergence. GT assumes that molecular clouds and their substructures are in approximate virial equilibrium and are in a near-stationary state, interprets the linewidth-derived nonthermal motions exclusively as turbulence, which provides additional pressure against self-gravity. Conversely, GHC assumes that most star-forming molecular clouds and their substructures are part of a continuous gravitationally-driven flow, each accreting from their parent structure. Thus, the clouds and their star formation rate evolve in time. GHC interprets nonthermal motions as a mixture of infall and turbulent components, with the relative importance of the former increasing as the objects become denser and/or more massive. Tests that may provide clues to distinguishing between GT and GHC must take into account that the innermost parts of globally gravitationally bound structures may not locally appear bound, and thus the binding may have to be searched for at the largest scale of the structure.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS II: Discovery of Cross-shaped X-ray Emission and a Rotating Circumnuclear Disk in the Supermassive S0 Galaxy NGC 5084</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining Chandra, ALMA, EVLA, and Hubble Space Telescope archival data and newly acquired APO/DIS spectroscopy, we detect a double-lobed 17~kpc X-ray emission with plumes oriented approximately perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane of the massive lenticular galaxy NGC\,5084 at 0.3--2.0~keV.
  We detect a highly inclined ($i=71.2^{+1.8\circ}_{-1.7}$), molecular circumnuclear disk ($D=304^{+10}_{-11}$ pc) in the core of the galaxy rotating (V$^{\rm (2-1) CO}_{\rm rot}=242.7^{+9.6}_{-6.4}$ km s$^{-1}$) in a direction perpendicular to that of the galactic disk, implying a total mass of $\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{\rm BH}}{M_{\odot}} \right) = 7.66^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for NGC\,5084's supermassive black hole. Archival EVLA radio observations at 6 cm and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane, extending to a distance of $\overline{R}=4.6\pm0.6$ kpc from the core, oriented with the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range.
  Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength archival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This discovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including \SAUNAS\ (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), demonstrating the abundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing astronomical archives.</description>

      <title>Correlation between dust continuum and CN line emissions in high-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the strength of three dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN ($N = 1 - 0$) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{LOS}$) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{POS}$). We use the CN ($N = 1 - 0$) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO) 14-m telescope and the dust continuum data from $Herschel$ archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H$_2$ column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H$_2$ column densities at least over the H$_2$ column density of 8.0 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ within one or two telescope beam size in all targets, implying that CN line and dust continuum emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their B$_\mathrm{LOS}$ and B$_\mathrm{POS}$, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.</description>

      <title>An Accreting Supermassive Black Hole Buried in a Faint Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there have been several discoveries of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies including an AGN in an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy with a Black Hole mass $&gt;$10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, finding a Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) in a dwarf Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy is rare. We report the discovery of a Seyfert type-2 class AGN which is associated with a nuclear SMBH of mass $\sim$6.5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ in a dwarf LSB galaxy ($\mu_{0,r}$ $&gt;$ 23.8 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) that we denote by MJ0818+2257. The galaxy was previously thought to be an outlying emission blob around the large spiral galaxy LEDA 1678924. In our current analysis, which includes the detection of the optical counterpart of MJ0818+2257, we study its ionized gas kinematics and find that the dynamical mass within the ionized gas disk is $\sim$5.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This is comparable to its stellar mass which is $\sim$3$\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and suggests that MJ0818+2257 is moderately dark matter-dominated within the stellar disk. The SMBH mass to galaxy stellar mass ratio is $M_{BH}/M(*)&gt;0.022$ which is high compared to disk galaxies. Our detection of a SMBH in a bulgeless LSB dwarf galaxy raises questions about the growth of SMBHs in low-luminosity galaxies and suggests the possibility of detecting heavy, seed black holes from early epochs in LSB dwarf galaxies in the low redshift universe.</description>

      <title>On the kinematic nature of apparent discs at high redshifts: Local counterparts are not dominated by ordered rotation but by tangentially anisotropic random motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not straightforward to physically interpret the apparent morphology of galaxies. Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts ($z&gt;2$) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure. To break degeneracy and assess the rotational support of typical high-$z$ galaxies in the JWST samples, those with active star formation and stellar masses $\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal{M}_{\star}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})\sim9$, we study the kinematics of their equal-mass counterparts at $z=0$. While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-$z$ JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts. Such shape transition (prolate$\Rightarrow$oblate) indicates an associated change in orbital anisotropy (radial$\Rightarrow$tangential), with roots likely in the assembly of their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at $z\sim5.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at $z\sim5.7$ in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of $\sim2\times10^{10} M_\odot$ and a star formation rate of $\sim200 M_\odot$/yr within a central region of radius $R=2$ Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities ($27\pm6\%$), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower ($6\pm2\%$) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at $4000$AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XVI: Size Evolution of Massive Dusty Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn from UV to IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to study the evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) sizes for a statistical sample of massive ($\gtrsim10^{9}$M$_{\odot}$) high redshift galaxies (z $\in$ [5,10]). Galaxies are post-processed using the SKIRT radiative transfer code, to self-consistently obtain the full spectral energy distribution and surface brightness distribution. We create mock observations of the galaxies for the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to study the rest-frame UV 1500 $\unicode{xC5}$ morphology. We also generate mock rest-frame FIR (50 $\mu$m) photometry and mock ALMA (158 $\mu$m) (0.01"-0.03" and $\approx$0.3" angular resolution) observations to study the dust-continuum. We find the effect of dust on observed sizes reduces with increasing wavelength from the UV to optical ($\sim$0.6 times the UV at 0.4$\mu$m), with no evolution in FIR sizes. Observed sizes vary within 0.4-1.2 times the intrinsic sizes at different signal to noise ratios (SNR = 5-20) across redshifts. The effect of PSF and noise makes bright structures prominent, whereas fainter regions blend with noise, leading to an underestimation (factor of 0.4-0.8) of sizes at SNR=5. At SNR=15-20, the underestimation reduces (factor of 0.6-0.9) at z=5-8 but due to PSF, at z=9-10, bright cores are dominant, resulting in an overestimation (factor of 1.0-1.2). For ALMA, low resolution sizes are effected by noise which acts as extended emission. The size evolution in UV broadly agrees with current observational samples and other simulations. This work is one of the first to analyse the panchromatic sizes of a statistically significant sample of simulated high-redshift galaxies, complementing a growing body of research highlighting the importance of conducting an equivalent comparison between observed galaxies and their simulated counterparts in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Fate of the remnant in tidal stripping event: repeating and non-repeating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams Above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects (YSOs). They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast ($&gt;100$~km/s) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of the circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magneto-centrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called ``avalanche accretion streams" near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field-dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magneto-centrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).</description>

      <title>GalaxyFlow: Upsampling Hydrodynamical Simulations for Realistic Mock Stellar Catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations of galaxies operate at the level of "star particles" with a mass resolution on the scale of thousands of solar masses. Turning these simulations into stellar mock catalogs requires "upsampling" the star particles into individual stars following the same phase-space density. In this paper, we introduce two new upsampling methods. First, we describe GalaxyFlow, a sophisticated upsampling method that utilizes normalizing flows to both estimate the stellar phase space density and sample from it. Second, we improve on existing upsamplers based on adaptive kernel density estimation, using maximum likelihood estimation to fine-tune the bandwidth for such algorithms in a way that improves both the density estimation accuracy and upsampling results. We demonstrate our upsampling techniques on a neighborhood of the Solar location in two simulated galaxies: Auriga 6 and h277. Both yield smooth stellar distributions that closely resemble the stellar densities seen in the Gaia DR3 catalog. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multi-model classifier test to compare the accuracy of different upsampling methods quantitatively. This test confirms that GalaxyFlow estimates the density of the underlying star particles more accurately than methods based on kernel density estimation, at the cost of being more computationally intensive.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy of the triply-lensed $z = 10.17$ galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed $z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII] $\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII] $\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$, ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$ damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius $70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older ($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.</description>

      <title>An Estimate of the Impact of Reionization on Supermassive Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at $z &gt; 6$ were formed during the epoch of reionization. Because reionization is an inhomogeneous process, the physical properties of SMBH host galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce an SMBH's mass by up to [50, 70, 90] % within dark matter halos of mass [$10^{12}$, $10^{11}$, $10^{10}$] M$_{\odot}$ by $z$ = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which black hole growth is impacted by reionization strongly depends on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that black hole masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization ($z$ &gt; 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of black holes residing in &lt; 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ halos by a factor of &gt; 2. The census of supermassive black holes being uncovered by the James Webb Space Telescope may offer a means to test the basic prediction that more massive black holes reside in cosmological volumes that are reionized at later times.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: X-ray beacons at late cosmic dawn</title>

Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is expected to contain ~100 quasars that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years old, i.e. at z&gt;5.6. By selection, these quasars populate the bright end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and their count offers a powerful demographic diagnostic of the parent super-massive black hole population. Of the &gt;~ 400 quasars that have been discovered at z&gt;5.6 to date, less than 15 % have been X-ray detected. We present a pilot survey to uncover the elusive X-ray luminous end of the distant quasar population. We have designed a quasar selection pipeline based on optical, infrared and X-ray imaging data from DES DR2, VHS DR5, CatWISE2020 and the eRASS. The core selection method relies on SED template fitting. We performed optical follow-up spectroscopy with the Magellan/LDSS3 instrument for the redshift confirmation of a subset of candidates. We have further obtained a deeper X-ray image of one of our candidates with Chandra ACIS-S. We report the discovery of five new quasars in the redshift range 5.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.1. Two of these quasars are detected in eRASS and are by selection X-ray ultra-luminous. These quasars are also detected at radio frequencies. The first one is a broad absorption line quasar which shows significant X-ray dimming over 3.5 years, i.e. about 6 months in the quasar rest frame. The second radio-detected quasar is a jetted source with compact morphology. We show that a blazar configuration is likely for this source, making it the second most distant blazar known to date. With our pilot study, we demonstrate the power of eROSITA as a discovery machine for luminous quasars in the epoch of reionization. The X-ray emission of the two eROSITA detected quasars are likely to be driven by different high-energetic emission mechanisms a diversity which will be further explored in a future systematic full-hemisphere survey.</description>

      <title>Bidimensional Exploration of the warm-Temperature Ionised gaS (BETIS) II. Revisiting the ionisation mechanism of the extraplanar diffuse ionised gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraplanar diffuse ionised gas is a key component for understanding the feedback processes that connect galactic discs and their halos. In this paper, we present the second study of the BETIS project, which aims to explore the ionisation mechanisms of the eDIG. We use a sample of eight edge-on galaxies observed with MUSE and apply the methodology developed in the first paper of the BETIS project. We found that the vertical and radial profiles of the [NII]/Ha, [SII]/Ha, [OIII]/Hb, and [OI]/Ha ratios depict a complex ionisation structure within galactic halos, influenced by the spatial distribution of HII regions across the galactic plane as observed from our line of sigh, with photon leakage from OB associations constituting the main ionisation source. Our analysis excludes low-mass, hot, and evolved stars as viable candidates for secondary ionisation sources to elucidate the unusual behaviour of the line ratios at greater distances from the galactic midplane. In contrast, we ascertain that shocks induced in the interstellar medium by star formation related feedback mechanisms represent a promising secondary ionisation source of the eDIG. We present a suite of models integrating ionisation mechanisms arising from fast shocks and photoionisation associated with star formation. When applied to the classical BPT diagrams, these models reveal that the ionisation budget of the eDIG ranges from 20% to 50% across our sample, with local variations of up to 20% within individual galaxy halos. This correlates with the presence of filaments and other structural components observed within galaxy halos. The presence of shocks is additionally supported by the observation of high-density, high [OI]/Ha ratios, characteristic of shock-compressed ionised gas, likely induced by feedback from regions of intense SF within the disk. These results are consistent across all galaxies analysed in this sample.</description>

      <title>Peculiar dark matter halos inferred from gravitational lensing as a manifestation of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If modified gravity holds, but the weak lensing analysis is done in the standard way, one finds that dark matter halos have peculiar shapes, not following the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profiles, and are fully predictable from the distribution of baryons. Here we study in detail the distribution of the apparent dark matter around point masses, which approximate galaxies and galaxy clusters, and their pairs for the QUMOND MOND gravity, taking an external gravitational acceleration $g_e$ into account. At large radii, the apparent halo of a point mass $M$ is shifted against the direction of the external field. When averaged over all lines-of-sight, the halo has a hollow center, and denoting the by $a_0$ the MOND acceleration constant, its density behaves like $\rho(r)=\sqrt{Ma_0/G}/(4\pi r^2)$ between the galacticentric radii $\sqrt{GM/a_0}$ and $\sqrt{GMa_0}/g_e$, and like $\rho\propto r^{-7}G^2M^3a_0^3/g_e^5$ further away. Between a pair of point masses, there is a region of a negative apparent dark matter density, whose mass can exceed the baryonic mass of the system. The density of the combined dark matter halo is not a sum of the densities of the halos of the individual points. The density has a singularity near the zero-acceleration point, but remains finite in projection. We compute maps of the surface density and the lensing shear for several configurations of the problem, and derive formulas to scale them to further configurations. In general, for a large subset of MOND theories in their weak field regime, for any configuration of the baryonic mass $M$ with the characteristic size of $d$, the total lensing density scales as $\rho({\vec{x}})=\sqrt{Ma_0/G}d^{-2}f\left(\vec{\alpha},\vec{x}/d,g_ed/\sqrt{GMa_0}\right)$, where the vector $\vec{\alpha}$ describes the geometry of the system. Distinguishing between QUMOND and cold dark matter seems possible with the existing instruments.</description>

      <title>Scattering of dark pions in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Revised LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $\mathbf{z\approx9.1}$ using Machine Learning and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for foregrounds mitigation in data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to measure the high-redshift 21-cm signal power spectrum has been shown to have issues of signal loss when the 21-cm signal covariance is misestimated. To address this problem, we have recently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations of the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours ($\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \approx 9.1$, and report revised upper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past results reporting a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (80)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller correlation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based approach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias correction for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (25)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we still caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the upper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.</description>
