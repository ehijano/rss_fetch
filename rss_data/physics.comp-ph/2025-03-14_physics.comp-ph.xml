      <title>KARL -- A Monte Carlo model for atomic and molecular processes in the tritium atmosphere of the KATRIN experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new parallelized simulation code is presented, which uses a Monte Carlo method to determine particle spectra in the KATRIN source. Reaction chains are generated from the decay of tritium within the source. The code includes all relevant processes: elastic scattering, ionization, excitation (electric, vibrational, rotational), recombination and various clustering processes. The main emphasis of the code is the calculation of particle spectra and particle densities and currents at specific points within the source. It features a new technique to determine these quantities. It also calculates target fields for the interaction of particles with each other as it is needed for recombination processes. The code has been designed for the KATRIN experiment but is easily adapt-able for other tritium based experiments like Project 8. Geometry and background tritium gas flow can be given as user input. The code is parallelized using MPI and writes output using HDF5. Input to the simulation is read from a JSON description.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of interacting turbulent and rarefied gas flows in the DSMC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiscale stochastic-deterministic coupling method is proposed to investigate the complex interactions between turbulent and rarefied gas flows within a unified framework. This method intermittently integrates the general synthetic iterative scheme with the shear stress transport turbulence model into the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach, enabling the simulation of gas flows across the free-molecular, transition, slip, and turbulent regimes. First, the macroscopic synthetic equations, derived directly from DSMC, are coupled with the turbulence model to establish a constitutive relation that incorporates not only turbulent and laminar transport coefficients but also higher-order terms accounting for rarefaction effects. Second, the macroscopic properties, statistically sampled over specific time intervals in DSMC, along with the turbulent properties provided by the turbulence model, serve as initial conditions for solving the macroscopic synthetic equations. Finally, the simulation particles in DSMC are updated based on the macroscopic properties obtained from the synthetic equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method asymptotically converges to either the turbulence model or DSMC results, adaptively adjusting to different flow regimes. Then, this coupling method is applied to simulate an opposing jet surrounded by hypersonic rarefied gas flows, revealing significant variations in surface properties due to the interplay of turbulent and rarefied effects. This study presents an efficient methodology for simulating the complex interplay between rarefied and turbulent flows, establishing a foundational framework for investigating the coupled effects of turbulence, hypersonic conditions, and chemical reactions in rarefied gas dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Active learning for parameter-free multiscale modeling of boundary lubrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lubricated friction is a multiscale problem where molecular processes dictate the macroscopic response of the system. Traditional lubrication models rely on semi-empirical constitutive relations, which become unreliable under extreme conditions. Here, we present a simulation framework that seamlessly couples molecular and continuum models for boundary lubrication without fixed-form constitutive laws. We train Gaussian process regression models as surrogates for predicting interfacial shear and normal stress in molecular dynamics simulations. An active learning algorithm ensures that our model adapts in scenarios where common constitutive laws fail, such as near phase transitions. We demonstrate our approach for nanoscale fluid flow over rough and heterogeneous surfaces, paving the way for accurate boundary lubrication simulations at experimental length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Learning second-order TVD flux limiters using differentiable solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven framework for learning optimal second-order total variation diminishing (TVD) flux limiters via differentiable simulations. In our fully differentiable finite volume solvers, the limiter functions are replaced by neural networks. By representing the limiter as a pointwise convex linear combination of the Minmod and Superbee limiters, we enforce both second-order accuracy and TVD constraints at all stages of training. Our approach leverages gradient-based optimization through automatic differentiation, allowing a direct backpropagation of errors from numerical solutions to the limiter parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on various hyperbolic conservation laws, including the linear advection equation, the Burgers' equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations. Remarkably, a limiter trained solely on linear advection exhibits strong generalizability, surpassing the accuracy of most classical flux limiters across a range of problems with shocks and discontinuities. The learned flux limiters can be readily integrated into existing computational fluid dynamics codes, and the proposed methodology also offers a flexible pathway to systematically develop and optimize flux limiters for complex flow problems.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a fuel cell composed of Lithium Deuteride (LiD) in a spherical geometry, in which isotropic monoenergetic neutrons of 0.025 eV (thermal neutrons) are generated at the center. The objective is to investigate the production of Tritium via interactions with Lithium-6. The physics of the process has been modeled and analyzed for thirteen different concentrations of Lithium-6 to determine the most advantageous option among them. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the GEANT4 toolkit to analyze neutron interactions and tritium production efficiency as a function of Lithium-6 concentration.</description>

      <title>The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.</description>

      <title>Integrated Experiment and Simulation Co-Design: A Key Infrastructure for Predictive Mesoscale Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of structural &amp; functional materials for specialized applications is being fueled by rapid advancements in materials synthesis, characterization, manufacturing, with sophisticated computational materials modeling frameworks that span a wide spectrum of length &amp; time scales in the mesoscale between atomistic &amp; continuum approaches. This is leading towards a systems-based design methodology that will replace traditional empirical approaches, embracing the principles of the Materials Genome Initiative. However, several gaps remain in this framework as it relates to advanced structural materials:(1) limited availability &amp; access to high-fidelity experimental &amp; computational datasets, (2) lack of co-design of experiments &amp; simulation aimed at computational model validation,(3) lack of on-demand access to verified and validated codes for simulation and for experimental analyses, &amp; (4) limited opportunities for workforce training and educational outreach. These shortcomings stifle major innovations in structural materials design. This paper describes plans for a community-driven research initiative that addresses current gaps based on best-practice recommendations of leaders in mesoscale modeling, experimentation &amp; cyberinfrastructure obtained at an NSF-sponsored workshop dedicated to this topic. The proposal is to create a hub for Mesoscale Experimentation and Simulation co-Operation (hMESO)-that will (I) provide curation and sharing of models, data, &amp; codes, (II) foster co-design of experiments for model validation with systematic uncertainty quantification, &amp; (III) provide a platform for education &amp; workforce development. It will engage experimental &amp; computational experts in mesoscale mechanics and plasticity, along with mathematicians and computer scientists with expertise in algorithms, data science, machine learning, &amp; large-scale cyberinfrastructure initiatives.</description>

      <title>Far-Field Sensitivity to Local Boundary Perturbations in 2D Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the sensitivity of the scattered wave field to perturbations in the shape of a scattering body illuminated by an incident plane wave. This study is motivated by recent work on the inverse problem of reconstructing a scatterer shape from measurements of the scattered wave at large distances from the scatterer. For this purpose we consider star-shaped scatterers represented using cubic splines, and our approach is based on a Nystr\"om method-based discretisation of the shape derivative. Using the singular value decomposition, we identify fundamental geometric modes that most strongly influence the scattered wave, providing insight into the most visible boundary features in scattering data.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general framework for the Discontinuous Galerkin-induced Neural Network (DGNet) inspired by the Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Method (IPDGM). In this approach, the trial space consists of piecewise neural network space defined over the computational domain, while the test function space is composed of piecewise polynomials. We demonstrate the advantages of DGNet in terms of accuracy and training efficiency across several numerical examples, including stationary and time-dependent problems. Specifically, DGNet easily handles high perturbations, discontinuous solutions, and complex geometric domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</description>

Abstract: The modified Born series method is a fast and accurate method for simulating wave propagation in complex structures. Currently, its main limitation is that the simulation size is limited by the working memory of a single computer or graphics processing unit (GPU). Here, we present a domain decomposition method that removes this limitation. We show how to decompose large problems over subdomains while maintaining the method's accuracy, memory efficiency, and guaranteed monotonic convergence. We demonstrate our approach by solving the Helmholtz problem for a complex structure of size $315\times 315\times 315$ wavelengths in just 1.4 hours on a dual-GPU system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Path Planning for the Design of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>Proposed optomechanical systems based on luminescence-induced optical forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical system utilizing luminescence-induced optical forces (LIOFs). Anisotropic dielectric structures enhance the recoil force from the luminescence. The optomechanical resonator consists of a composite film with a dielectric membrane, luminescent nanofilm, and a metallic substrate. The LIOF causes a mechanical frequency shift in the oscillator known as the optical spring effect. These results link the quantum properties of luminescent nanomaterials with those of other quantum-mechanical systems with vastly different frequency regimes via induced vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>
