      <title>Parallelizing MCMC Across the Sequence Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are foundational algorithms for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling. However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</description>

      <title>VPPE: Application of Scaled Vecchia Approximations to Parallel Partial Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer models or simulators are widely used across scientific fields, but are computationally expensive limiting their use to explore possible scenarios/outcomes. Gaussian process emulators are statistical surrogates that can rapidly approximate the outputs of computer models at untested inputs and enable uncertainty quantification studies. The parallel partial emulation (PPE) was developed to model simulators with vector-valued outputs. While the PPE is adept at fitting simulator data with multidimensional outputs, the time to fit the PPE increases quickly as the number of training runs increases. The Scaled Vecchia approximation, a fast approximation to multivariate Gaussian likelihoods, makes fitting Gaussian process emulators with large training datasets tractable. Here we introduce the Vecchia Parallel Partial Emulation (VPPE) that utilizes the Scaled Vecchia approximation within the PPE framework to allow for parallel partial emulation with larger training datasets. The VPPE is applied to three computer experiments, a synthetic data set, a hydrology model, and a volcanic flow model, yielding comparable predictive accuracy to the PPE at a fraction of the runtime.</description>

      <title>Solving Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind via Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

      <title>Simulations in Statistical Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations play important and diverse roles in statistical workflows, for example, in model specification, checking, validation, and even directly in model inference. Over the past decades, the application areas and overall potential of simulations in statistical workflows have expanded significantly, driven by the development of new simulation-based algorithms and exponentially increasing computational resources. In this paper, we examine past and current trends in the field and offer perspectives on how simulations may shape the future of statistical practice.</description>
