      <title>A panoramic view of groupoids and MRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This sequel to \cite{im2008} uses groupoid technology to provide new proofs of the famous theorems of Mallat \cite[Theorem 1 and 2]{Mall_TAMS89} that extend to much broader contexts than those conceived by Mallat.
  This work was inspired in large part by \cite{Bagg_co_JFAA09,Bag_co_JFA10,LarRae_CM06,Larsen-Raeburn2007}, written by Iain Raeburn and co-authors.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between the ultraproduct of a crossed product C*algebra $(A\rtimes_{r}G)^{\omega}$ and the crossed product of an ultraproduct C*algebra $A^{\omega}\rtimes _{r}G$ for a fixed free ultrafilter $\omega$ on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of the Exel-Pardo's notion of self-similar graph, we introduce self-similar group actions on ultragraphs and their $C^*$-algebras. We then approach to the $C^*$-algebras by inverse semigroup and tight groupoid models.</description>

      <title>The RFD property for graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that the graph C*-algebra of a finite graph is residually finite-dimensional (RFD) if and only if no cycle has an entry. To obtain this result we prove that C*-algebras of graphs with finitely many vertices often admit a convenient decomposition into amalgamated free products.</description>

      <title>Selfless reduced free product $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study selflessness in the general setting of reduced free products of $C^*$-algebras. Towards this end, we develop a suitable theory of rapid decay for filtrations in arbitrary $C^*$-probability spaces. We provide several natural examples and permanence properties of this phenomenon. By using this framework in combination with von Neumann algebraic techniques involving approximate forms of orthogonality, we are able to prove selflessness for general families of reduced free product $C^*$-algebras. As an instance of our results, we prove selflessness and thus strict comparison for the canonical $C^*$-algebras generated by Voiculescu's free semicircular systems. Our results also provide new examples of purely infinite reduced free products.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topos of quantum sets and embed into it the classical topos of sets. We show that the internal logic of the topos of sets, when interpreted in the topos of quantum sets, provides the Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum propositional calculus of idempotents in a canonical internal commutative algebra of the topos of quantum sets. We extend this construction by allowing the quantum counterpart of Boolean algebras of classical truth values which we introduce and study in detail. We realize expected values of observables in quantum states in our topos of quantum sets as a tautological morphism from the canonical internal commutative algebra to a canonical internal object of affine functions on quantum states. We show also that in our topos of quantum sets one can speak about quantum quivers in the sense of Day-Street and Chikhladze. Finally, we provide a categorical derivation of the Leavitt path algebra of such a quantum quiver and relate it to the category of stable representations of the quiver. It is based on a categorification of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra in the context of functor adjunctions replacing the customary use of Hilbert modules.</description>

      <title>Coronas and strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal D$ be a strongly self-absorbing $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra. Given any separable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $A$, our two main results assert the following. If $A$ is $\mathcal D$-stable, then the corona algebra of $A$ is $\mathcal D$-saturated, i.e., $\mathcal D$ embeds unitally into the relative commutant of every separable $\mathrm{C}^*$-subalgebra. Conversely, assuming that the stable corona of $A$ is separably $\mathcal D$-stable, we prove that $A$ is $\mathcal D$-stable. This generalizes recent work by the first-named author on the structure of the Calkin algebra. As an immediate corollary, it follows that the multiplier algebra of a separable $\mathcal D$-stable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra is separably $\mathcal D$-stable. Appropriate versions of the aforementioned results are also obtained when $A$ is not necessarily separable. The article ends with some non-trivial applications.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>von Neumann Subfactors and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>
