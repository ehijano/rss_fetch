      <title>3D Growth and Remodeling Theory Supports the Hypothesis of Staphyloma Formation from Local Scleral Weakening under Normal Intraocular Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\bf{Purpose}$: To assess whether Growth &amp; Remodeling (G&amp;R) theory could explain staphyloma formation from a local scleral weakening.
  $\bf{Methods}$: A finite element model of a healthy eye was reconstructed, including the following connective tissues: the lamina cribrosa, the peripapillary sclera, and the peripheral sclera. The scleral shell was modelled as a constrained mixture, consisting of an isotropic ground matrix and two collagen fiber families (circumferential and meridional). The homogenized constrained mixture model was employed to simulate the adaptation of the sclera to alterations in its biomechanical environment over a duration of 13.7 years. G&amp;R processes were triggered by reducing the shear stiffness of the ground matrix in the peripapillary sclera and lamina cribrosa by 85%. Three distinct G&amp;R scenarios were investigated: (1) low mass turnover rate in combination with transmural volumetric growth; (2) high mass turnover rate in combination with transmural volumetric growth; and (3) high mass turnover rate in combination with mass density growth.
  $\bf{Results}$: In scenario 1, we observed a significant outpouching of the posterior pole, closely resembling the shape of a Type-III staphyloma. Additionally, we found a notable change in scleral curvature and a thinning of the peripapillary sclera by 84%. In contrast, scenarios 2 and 3 exhibited less drastic deformations, with stable posterior staphylomas after approximately 7 years.
  $\bf{Conclusions}$: Our framework suggests that local scleral weakening is sufficient to trigger staphyloma formation under normal intraocular pressure. With patient-specific scleral geometries (obtainable via wide-field optical coherence tomography), our framework could aid in identifying individuals at risk of developing posterior staphylomas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of the model architecture and key technologies of generative artificial intelligence, combined with specific application cases, and uses conditional generative adversarial networks ( cGAN ) and time series analysis methods to simulate and predict dynamic changes in financial markets. The research results show that the cGAN model can effectively capture the complexity of financial market data, and the deviation between the prediction results and the actual market performance is minimal, showing a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Composite Bayesian Optimization In Function Spaces Using NEON -- Neural Epistemic Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is a rising field of scientific computing where inputs or outputs of a machine learning model are functions defined in infinite-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we introduce NEON (Neural Epistemic Operator Networks), an architecture for generating predictions with uncertainty using a single operator network backbone, which presents orders of magnitude less trainable parameters than deep ensembles of comparable performance. We showcase the utility of this method for sequential decision-making by examining the problem of composite Bayesian Optimization (BO), where we aim to optimize a function $f=g\circ h$, where $h:X\to C(\mathcal{Y},\mathbb{R}^{d_s})$ is an unknown map which outputs elements of a function space, and $g: C(\mathcal{Y},\mathbb{R}^{d_s})\to \mathbb{R}$ is a known and cheap-to-compute functional. By comparing our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on toy and real world scenarios, we demonstrate that NEON achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring orders of magnitude less trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of transient finite-strain coupled diffusion-deformation theories for hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative review and classification between some well-known thermodynamically consistent models of hydrogel behavior in a large deformation setting, specifically focusing on solvent absorption/desorption and its impact on mechanical deformation and network swelling. The proposed discussion addresses formulation aspects, general mathematical classification of the governing equations, and numerical implementation issues based on the finite element method. The theories are presented in a unified framework demonstrating that, despite not being evident in some cases, all of them follow equivalent thermodynamic arguments. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out where Taylor-Hood elements are employed in the spatial discretization to satisfy the inf-sup condition and to prevent spurious numerical oscillations. The resulting discrete problems are solved using the FEniCS platform through consistent variational formulations, employing both monolithic and staggered approaches. We conduct benchmark tests on various hydrogel structures, demonstrating that major differences arise from the chosen volumetric response of the hydrogel. The significance of this choice is frequently underestimated in the state-of-the-art literature but has been shown to have substantial implications on the resulting hydrogel behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to portfolio optimization by integrating Transformer models with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) within the Black-Litterman (BL) framework. Capitalizing on Transformers' ability to discern long-range dependencies and GANs' proficiency in generating accurate predictive models, our method enhances the generation of refined predictive views for BL portfolio allocations. This fusion of our model with BL's structured method for merging objective views with market equilibrium offers a potent tool for modern portfolio management, outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our integrated approach not only demonstrates the potential to improve investment decision-making but also contributes a new approach to capture the complexities of financial markets for robust portfolio optimization.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces MarketSenseAI, an innovative framework leveraging GPT-4's advanced reasoning for selecting stocks in financial markets. By integrating Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, MarketSenseAI analyzes diverse data sources, including market trends, news, fundamentals, and macroeconomic factors, to emulate expert investment decision-making. The development, implementation, and validation of the framework are elaborately discussed, underscoring its capability to generate actionable and interpretable investment signals. A notable feature of this work is employing GPT-4 both as a predictive mechanism and signal evaluator, revealing the significant impact of the AI-generated explanations on signal accuracy, reliability and acceptance. Through empirical testing on the competitive S&amp;P 100 stocks over a 15-month period, MarketSenseAI demonstrated exceptional performance, delivering excess alpha of 10% to 30% and achieving a cumulative return of up to 72% over the period, while maintaining a risk profile comparable to the broader market. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of Large Language Models in financial decision-making, marking a significant leap in integrating generative AI into financial analytics and investment strategies.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Hydropower Management Approach for Downstream Ecosystem Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydropower plants play a pivotal role in advancing clean and sustainable energy production, contributing significantly to the global transition towards renewable energy sources. However, hydropower plants are currently perceived both positively as sources of renewable energy and negatively as disruptors of ecosystems. In this work, we highlight the overlooked potential of using hydropower plant as protectors of ecosystems by using adaptive ecological discharges. To advocate for this perspective, we propose using a neural network to predict the minimum ecological discharge value at each desired time. Additionally, we present a novel framework that seamlessly integrates it into hydropower management software, taking advantage of the well-established approach of using traditional constrained optimisation algorithms. This novel approach not only protects the ecosystems from climate change but also contributes to potentially increase the electricity production.</description>

      <title>GradNav: Accelerated Exploration of Potential Energy Surfaces with Gradient-Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of molecular systems' potential energy surface is important for comprehending their complex behaviors, particularly through identifying various metastable states. However, the transition between these states is often hindered by substantial energy barriers, demanding prolonged molecular simulations that consume considerable computational efforts. Our study introduces the GradNav algorithm, which enhances the exploration of the energy surface, accelerating the reconstruction of the potential energy surface (PES). This algorithm employs a strategy of initiating short simulation runs from updated starting points, derived from prior observations, to effectively navigate across potential barriers and explore new regions. To evaluate GradNav's performance, we introduce two metrics: the deepest well escape frame (DWEF) and the search success initialization ratio (SSIR). Through applications on Langevin dynamics within Mueller-type potential energy surfaces and molecular dynamics simulations of the Fs-Peptide protein, these metrics demonstrate GradNav's enhanced ability to escape deep energy wells, as shown by reduced DWEF values, and its reduced reliance on initial conditions, highlighted by increased SSIR values. Consequently, this improved exploration capability enables more precise energy estimations from simulation trajectories.</description>

      <title>BERTopic-Driven Stock Market Predictions: Unraveling Sentiment Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and financial analysis, focusing on the impact of sentiment analysis in stock price prediction. We employ BERTopic, an advanced NLP technique, to analyze the sentiment of topics derived from stock market comments. Our methodology integrates this sentiment analysis with various deep learning models, renowned for their effectiveness in time series and stock prediction tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating topic sentiment notably enhances the performance of these models. The results indicate that topics in stock market comments provide implicit, valuable insights into stock market volatility and price trends. This study contributes to the field by showcasing the potential of NLP in enriching financial analysis and opens up avenues for further research into real-time sentiment analysis and the exploration of emotional and contextual aspects of market sentiment. The integration of advanced NLP techniques like BERTopic with traditional financial analysis methods marks a step forward in developing more sophisticated tools for understanding and predicting market behaviors.</description>
