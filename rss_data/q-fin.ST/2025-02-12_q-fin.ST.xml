      <title>Intraday order transition dynamics in high, medium, and low market cap stocks: A Markov chain approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An empirical stochastic analysis of high-frequency, tick-by-tick order data of NASDAQ100 listed stocks is conducted using a first-order discrete-time Markov chain model to explore intraday order transition dynamics. This analysis focuses on three market cap categories: High, Medium, and Low. Time-homogeneous transition probability matrices are estimated and compared across time-zones and market cap categories, and we found that limit orders exhibit higher degree of inertia (DoI), i.e., the probability of placing consecutive limit order is higher, during the opening hour. However, in the subsequent hour, the DoI of limit order decreases, while that of market order increases. Limit order adjustments via additions and deletions of limit orders increases significantly after the opening hour. All the order transitions then stabilize during mid-hours. As the closing hour approaches, consecutive order executions surge, with decreased placement of buy and sell limit orders following sell and buy executions, respectively. In terms of the differences in order transitions between stocks of different market cap, DoI of orders is stronger in high and medium market cap stocks. On the other hand, lower market cap stocks show a higher probability of limit order modifications and greater likelihood of submitting sell/buy limit orders after buy/sell executions. Further, order transitions are clustered across all stocks, except during opening and closing hours. The findings of this study may be useful in understanding intraday order placement dynamics across stocks of varying market cap, thus aiding market participants in making informed order placements at different times of trading hour.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions for High-Frequency Option Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a nonparametric higher-order asymptotic expansion for small-time changes of conditional characteristic functions of It\^o semimartingale increments. The asymptotics setup is of joint type: both the length of the time interval of the increment of the underlying process and the time gap between evaluating the conditional characteristic function are shrinking. The spot semimartingale characteristics of the underlying process as well as their spot semimartingale characteristics appear as leading terms in the derived asymptotic expansions. The analysis applies to a general class of It\^o semimartingales that includes in particular L\'evy-driven SDEs and time-changed L\'evy processes. The asymptotic expansion results are subsequently used to construct a test for whether volatility jumps are of finite or infinite variation. In an application to high-frequency data of options written on the S\&amp;P 500 index, we find evidence for infinite variation volatility jumps.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Bitcoin Mesoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The open availability of the entire history of the Bitcoin transactions opens up the possibility to study this system at an unprecedented level of detail. This contribution is devoted to the analysis of the mesoscale structural properties of the Bitcoin User Network (BUN), across its entire history (i.e. from 2009 to 2017). What emerges from our analysis is that the BUN is characterized by a core-periphery structure a deeper analysis of which reveals a certain degree of bow-tieness (i.e. the presence of a Strongly-Connected Component, an IN- and an OUT-component together with some tendrils attached to the IN-component). Interestingly, the evolution of the BUN structural organization experiences fluctuations that seem to be correlated with the presence of bubbles, i.e. periods of price surge and decline observed throughout the entire Bitcoin history: our results, thus, further confirm the interplay between structural quantities and price movements observed in previous analyses.</description>
