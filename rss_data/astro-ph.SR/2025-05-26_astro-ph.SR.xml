      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dynamos powered by white dwarf superficial convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the effective temperature of a cooling white dwarf $T_{\rm eff}$ drops below the ionization limit, it develops a surface convection zone that may generate a magnetic field $B$ through the dynamo mechanism. We revisit the surface dynamo theory systematically using detailed stellar evolution computations, as well as a simple analytical model that tracks the expansion of the convection zone. The magnetic field reaches a maximum of several kG (for a hydrogen atmosphere) shortly after a convection zone is established at a cooling time $t=t_{\rm conv}$. The field then declines as $B\propto T_{\rm eff}\propto t^{-7/20}$ until the convective envelope couples to the degenerate core at $t=t_{\rm coup}$. We compare the onset of convection $t_{\rm conv}\propto M^{25/21}$ to the crystallization of the white dwarf's core $t_{\rm cryst}\propto M^{-5/3}$, and find that in the mass range $0.5\,{\rm M}_\odot&lt;M&lt;0.9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ the order of events is $t_{\rm conv}&lt;t_{\rm cryst}&lt;t_{\rm coup}$. Specifically, surface dynamos are active for a period $\Delta t\approx t_{\rm cryst}-t_{\rm conv}$ of about a Gyr (shorter for higher masses), before the convection zone is overrun by a stronger magnetic field emanating from the crystallizing core. Our predicted magnetic fields are at the current detection limit, and we do not find any observed candidates that fit the theory. None the less, surface dynamos may be an inevitable outcome of white dwarf cooling, significantly affecting white dwarf accretion and seismology.</description>

      <title>Identification of Ion-Kinetic Instabilities in Hybrid-PIC Simulations of Solar Wind Plasma with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of ion-kinetic instabilities in solar wind plasmas is crucial for understanding energetics and dynamics throughout the heliosphere, as evident from spacecraft observations of complex ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) and ubiquitous ion-scale kinetic waves. In this work, we explore machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) classification models to identify unstable cases of ion VDFs driving kinetic waves. Using 34 hybrid particle-in-cell simulations of kinetic protons and $\alpha$-particles initialized using plasma parameters derived from solar wind observations, we prepare a dataset of nearly 1600 VDFs representing stable/unstable cases and associated plasma and wave properties. We compare feature-based classifiers applied to VDF moments, such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, with DL convolutional neural networks (CNN) applied directly to VDFs as images in the gyrotropic velocity plane. The best-performing classifier, Random Forest, has an accuracy of $0.96\pm0.01$, and a true skill score of $0.89\pm0.03$, with the majority of missed predictions made near stability thresholds. We study how the variations of the temporal derivative thresholds of anisotropies and magnetic energies and sampling strategies for simulation runs affect classification. CNN-based models have the highest accuracy of $0.88\pm0.18$ among all considered if evaluated on the runs entirely not used during the model training. The addition of the $E_{\perp}$ power spectrum as an input for the ML models leads to the improvement of instability analysis for some cases. The results demonstrate the potential of ML and DL for the detection of ion-scale kinetic instabilities using spacecraft observations of solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Turbulence Characteristics of Fast and Slow Coronal Mass Ejections at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal and turbulence properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is essential for analyzing their evolution and interactions with the surrounding medium. This study explores these characteristics across different regions of two distinct ICMEs observed at 1 AU, utilizing in-situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The polytropic indices, Gamma_e for electrons and Gamma_p for protons) reveal significant deviations from adiabatic expansion, suggesting sustained heating mechanisms within the ICMEs even at 1AU. The effective polytropic index (Gamma_eff) of the magnetic ejecta (ME) in both ICME1 and ICME2 is found to be near-isothermal (Gamma_eff = 0.88 and 0.76), aligning with measurements near the Sun, highlighting consistent heating across heliospheric distances. Spectral analysis at the inertial scale reveals Kolmogorov-like turbulence in the fast ICME1's ME, while the ME of the slower ICME2 exhibits less developed turbulence with a shallower spectral index (alpha_B). The turbulence analysis in the dissipation scale indicates that the ME of slower ICME2 is less affected by the ambient medium than the faster ICME2. The MEs of both ICMEs show magnetic compressibility much smaller than unity (C_B &lt; 1), suggesting dominant Alfvenic fluctuations in the MEs. Notably, the partial variance of increments (PVI) method identifies more intermittent structures, such as current sheets and reconnection sites, in the sheath and post-ICME regions. Higher PVI values correlate with regions of increased electron and proton temperature (for the sheath region), as well as higher C_B values, highlighting their role in local energy dissipation. These results underscore the importance of ongoing heating and turbulence processes in shaping the evolution of ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling compact planetary nebulae: Broad-band survey analysis and LAMOST confirmation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) are pivotal for advancing our knowledge of stellar evolution and galactic chemical enrichment. Recent progress in surveys and data analysis has revolutionized PN research, leading to the discovery of new objects and deeper insights into their properties. We have devised a novel photometric selection method, integrating GAIA and Pan-STARRS photometry, to identify compact PN candidates. This approach utilizes color-color diagrams, specifically (G-g) versus (GBP-GRP) and (G-r) versus (GBP-GRP), as primary criteria for candidate selection. The subsequent verification step involves confirming these candidates through LAMOST spectroscopic data. By cross-referencing a comprehensive dataset of PNe, GAIA, Pan-STARRS, and LAMOST DR7 spectra, we explore the potential of our approach and the crucial role played by these surveys in PN research. The LAMOST spectra provide compelling evidence supporting our selection criteria, especially for compact PNe characterized by strong emission lines and low continuum. Applying these criteria to a catalog of emission line objects, we have selected a PN candidate. Detailed analysis of its LAMOST spectrum unveiled classical Balmer emission lines and high-ionization lines (He II, [Ar V], [Ar III], [Ne III]), characteristic of high-ionization PNe, without low-excitation lines. Using the photoionization code Cloudy, our modeling revealed parameters including an ionizing source temperature of 180x10^3 K, luminosity around 3400 Lsun, and gas abundances encompassing various elements. Comparing the PNe evolution track, the progenitor star was estimated to have a mass of 2 Msun. Our findings show strong promise for separating compact PNe from other objects and provide a robust framework for further exploration of these surveys in the context of planetary nebulae.</description>

      <title>V965 Cephei revisited: evidence for a binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extended the $O-C$ diagram for V965 Cep with all currently available observations in the Johnson V filter and added unfiltered ones. The new, up-to-date $O-C$ diagram shows that the seeming period change previously revealed by the author does not occur uniformly. Instead, the near-parabolic part of the $O-C$ diagram can be a part of a periodic curve. This could be a sign of the second body in the system.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betel-buddy? Constraints on the dynamical companion to $\alpha$ Orionis from HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two independent analyses have asserted that the cause of the Long Secondary Period (LSP) observed in the variability spectrum of our nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Ori), is an as-yet undetected, low-mass binary companion dubbed $\alpha$ Ori B. In this paper, we present the results of a far-UV observational campaign using the STIS echelle spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at detecting spectral signatures of the companion. The four-quadrant tiling pattern and timing of the observations were optimized to isolate the companion, with observations taking place during a period of maximum angular and velocity separation between Betelgeuse and the putative companion. Spectral differencing between quadrants recovers no spectral features at the companion's velocity in excess of the background or Betelgeuse's chromosphere, i.e. a non-detection. Having determined that $\alpha$ Ori B is most likely a Young Stellar Object (YSO) thanks to constraints from a complementary X-ray campaign with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in a companion paper, comparison of our data against canonical spectra from YSOs in the ULLYSES database allows us to confidently exclude masses above $\gtrsim1.5M_\odot$ and companion continuum or line emission in excess of $\approx10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ angstrom$^{-1}$ in the FUV ($\approx1200-1700$ angstroms). Future observational campaigns aware of the LSP phase are needed to place deeper constraints on the spectroscopic nature of $\alpha$ Ori B.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse's Buddy: X-Ray Constraints on the Nature of $\alpha$ Ori B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sim$$2100$d Long Secondary Period of Betelgeuse's optical lightcurve and radial velocity motivated the prediction of a low-mass stellar companion, expected to be at maximal apparent separation from Betelgeuse around December 2024. We carried out Director's Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\lesssim$$2\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$4.7\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\lesssim$$5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$1.2\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Turbulence in Type Ia Supernova Deflagrations: Buoyancy-Driven Fuel Heating and Prospects for Delayed-Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to characterize the thermodynamic state of fuel mixed into the turbulent flame brush in the context of the Zel'dovich deflagration-to-detonation transition (ZDDT) mechanism of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We perform a series of three-dimensional computer simulations of thermonuclear deflagrations subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) for conditions found in model explosions of centrally ignited realistic, Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitors. These conditions correspond to explosion times when the flame reaches low density progenitor regions where DDT is expected to occur. The flame database is constructed using a thickened flame model. High numerical resolution is achieved with the help of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) approach allowing, for the first time, to resolve mesoscale buoyancy-driven flame turbulence. The system is evolved to a quasi-steady state, and flow properties in the turbulent region, where turbulence is most isotropic, is analyzed in a co-moving frame of reference. We find evidence for strong buoyancy-driven adiabatic heating of fuel layers adjacent to the flame front. The heating results in a dramatic reduction of fuel ignition times by between $\approx$2 and more than about 5 orders of magnitude. The heating increases with the RTI forcing. The observed shortening of fuel burning timescales suggests a new source of energy is important inside fuel penetrating the flame brush. These regions are up to several hundred meters wide. On the basis of the previous results of turbulent combustion in SNe Ia, preconditioning required by the ZDDT mechanism can occur there.</description>

      <title>The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS): The UV Photometric Catalog and Stripped Star Candidate Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most massive stars will interact with a binary companion during their lifetimes. These interactions can remove the hydrogen-rich envelope, producing intermediate-mass ($\sim$2-8 M$_\odot$) and helium-rich stars. These "stripped stars" are predicted to emit predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and can therefore be identified via a UV excess provided they are not outshone by their companion. However, despite their importance to binary evolution, supernovae, and ionizing feedback, few stripped stars have been confirmed. This is likely due to the scarcity of wide-field, high angular resolution, UV surveys of stellar populations with reliable distances and extinction estimates. To address this, we present the Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Clouds Survey (SUMS) catalog. We use the Tractor forward modeling software to perform PSF photometry on 2,420 Swift-UVOT images of the LMC and SMC. The resulting public catalog contains 734,869 sources in three UV filters to a depth of $\sim$20 Vega mag. We perform validation tests on the photometry pipeline and highlight the catalog's broad applicability. We then identify sources with excess UV light compared to main-sequence stars and apply a series of quality cuts. From this, we identify 522 candidate stripped stars in the LMC and 298 in the SMC. We assess the potential contamination from other UV excess systems and argue the dominant uncertainty to be dust: early main-sequence stars can mimic the colors of stripped star binaries when extinction is overcorrected. This survey lays the groundwork for the first systematic census of stripped stars and opens new windows into binary evolution and massive star populations.</description>

      <title>Resistive Collapse of 2D Non-rotating Magnetized Isothermal Toroids: Formation of Pseudodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of singular magnetized toroids (Li &amp; Shu 1996) is a natural representation of an early phase in star formation, bridging the prestellar and protostellar phases of the collapse of molecular cloud cores. We revisit the collapse study of Allen et al. (2003b), now with explicit nonideal MHD (Ohmic diffusivity $\eta$) and higher resolution using a code able to cover a broader range of the magnetization parameter $H_0$. Galli-Shu equatorial pseudodisks form for all values of $H_0$ and $\eta$, and the asymptotic central mass growth rate is in the scale $\dot{M}_*\sim(a^3/G)(1+H_0)$, where $a$ is the isothermal sound speed, consistent with previous results and predictions. The explicit Ohmic diffusivity makes the field line structure less radial than in previous work, connecting the pseudodisk more effectively to its surroundings. Matter can fall efficiently onto the pseudodisk surfaces, forming oblique shocks, where shock heating and large density gradients raise the possibility of rich astrochemistry. Pseudodisk size and structure are influenced by magnetic diffusivity. Force and velocity ratios were computed to explore the magnetic support within the pseudodisk and its induced slowdown in infall velocity. Magnetic diffusivity was measured to control the strength of these effects and their location within the pseudodisk. The dependence of the field line configurations, pseudodisk structure, and velocity ratios on magnetic diffusivity has observable consequences for collapsing envelopes.</description>

      <title>Long-Duration Nonthermal Motions in the Supra-Arcade and Loop-Top Region During an Eruptive Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are widely accepted to be powered by magnetic reconnection that involves complex dynamics in various scales. The flare supra-arcade and loop-top region, directly impacted by fast reconnection downflows, contains a wealth of microscopic dynamics, which are, however, difficult to resolve in imaging. We present simultaneous spectroscopic and imaging observations of hot flaring plasma above the loop tops by IRIS and SDO/AIA. IRIS continuously observed high-temperature Fe XXI 1354.08 A spectral emissions throughout the long-duration gradual phase of the X-class flare. We found weak Doppler blue shifts near the loop-top region, indicative of bulk plasma motions from chromospheric evaporation based on the 3D flare loop orientation. Strong nonthermal velocities are detected at the bottom of the flare supra-arcade fan/plasma sheet, suggestive of the presence of turbulence in the flare current sheet region. In addition, disorganized nonthermal plasma motions are constantly detected until the very end of the flare, indicating irregular unresolved plasma flows in the cusp and loop-top region. The spatial and temporal evolution of spectral parameters follow the dynamics resulting from on-going magnetic reconnection during the prolonged gradual phase. The long-lasting nonthermal plasma motions may contribute to the high and steady temperature of flaring plasmas above flare loops.</description>

      <title>Coronal dimmings and what they tell us about solar and stellar coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal dimmings associated with coronal mass ejections (CME) from the Sun have gained much attention since the late 1990s when they were first observed in high-cadence imagery of the SOHO/EIT and Yohkoh/SXT instruments. They appear as localized sudden decreases of the coronal emission at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) wavelengths, that evolve impulsively during the lift-off and early expansion phase of a CME. Coronal dimmings have been interpreted as "footprints" of the erupting flux rope and also as indicators of the coronal mass loss by CMEs. However, these are only some aspects of coronal dimmings and how they relate to the overall CME/flare process. The goal of this review is to summarize our current understanding and observational findings on coronal dimmings, how they relate to CME simulations, and to discuss how they can be used to provide us with a deeper insight and diagnostics of the triggering of CMEs, the magnetic connectivities and coronal reconfigurations due to the CME as well as the replenishment of the corona after an eruption. In addition, we go beyond a pure review by introducing a new, physics-driven categorization of coronal dimmings based on the magnetic flux systems involved in the eruption process. Finally, we discuss the recent progress in studying coronal dimmings on solar-like and late-type stars, and to use them as a diagnostics for stellar coronal mass ejections and their properties.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Polar Magnetic Fields Derived from MILOS and MERLIN Inversions with Hinode/SOT-SP Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed investigation of the polar magnetic field and its time evolution is one of the major achievements of Hinode. Precise measurements of the polar magnetic field are essential for understanding the solar cycle, as they provide important constraints for identifying the source regions of the solar wind. The Spectropolarimeter (SP) of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board Hinode has been the instrument best suited to make such measurements. In this study, we compare the SOT-SP data for the polar regions, processed using two representative Milne-Eddington inversion codes, MILOS and MERLIN. These codes are applied to the same level-1 SOT-SP data, and the same disambiguation algorithm is used on the maps that go through the two inversions. We find that the radial magnetic-flux density (the magnetic-flux density with respect to the local vertical) provided by the MERLIN inversion tends to be approximately 7%-10% larger than that obtained from the MILOS inversion. The slightly higher radial magnetic-flux density from MERLIN appears to be common to the polar magnetic fields observed at different phases of the solar cycle. When MILOS is run with the same scattered-light profile and the same magnetic filling factor that are derived with the MERLIN inversion, the radial magnetic-flux density derived from the two inversions is almost the same. We attribute the difference in the radial magnetic-flux density to different filling factors adopted by the two inversions, based on whether the scattered-light profiles are assumed to be the Stokes I profiles averaged over the neighboring pixels or over the entire field of view. The relationship between the radial magnetic-flux density and magnetic filling factor could be more complex in the polar (limb) observations due to the possible contributions of the transverse magnetic-field component to the estimation of the radial magnetic-flux density.</description>

      <title>Infrared diagnostics of late-time core-collapse supernova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red-supergiant and He-star explosions are presented, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating, solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun, and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models, primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas SN Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.81mic or [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. We find that the strength of [NeII]12.81mic correlates with progenitor mass but with additional strong sensitivity to, for example, ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our SN Ibc models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows much diversity, which compromises their use as diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by the JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on the inner workings of massive star explosions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetic activity in rapidly rotating binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar activity is fundamental to stellar evolution and the formation and habitability of exoplanets. The interaction between convective motions and rotation in cool stars results in a dynamo process that drives magnetic surface activity. In single stars, activity increases with rotation rate until it saturates for stars with rotation periods Prot &lt; 3 - 10 d. However, the mechanism responsible for saturation remains unclear. Observations indicate that red giants in binary systems that are in spin-orbit resonance exhibit stronger chromospheric activity than single stars with similar rotation rates, suggesting that tidal flows can influence surface activity. Here, we investigate the chromospheric activity of main-sequence binary stars to understand the impact of tidal forces on saturation phenomena. For binaries with 0.5 &lt; Prot/d &lt; 1, mainly contact binaries that share a common thermal envelope, we find enhanced activity rather than saturation. This result supports theoretical predictions that a large-scale $\alpha$ - $\omega$ dynamo during common-envelope evolution can generate strong magnetic fields. We also observe supersaturation in chromospheric activity, a phenomenon tentatively noted previously in coronal activity, where activity levels fall below saturation and decrease with shorter rotation periods. Our findings emphasise the importance of studying stellar activity in stars with extreme properties compared to the Sun's.</description>

      <title>Tools for Characterizing the Numerical Error of Stellar Oscillation Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar oscillation codes are software instruments that evaluate the normal-mode frequencies of an input stellar model. While inter-code comparisons are often used to confirm the correctness of calculations, they are not suitable for characterizing the numerical error of an individual code. To address this issue, we introduce a set of tools -- 'error measures' -- that facilitate this characterization. We explore the behavior of these error measures as calculation parameters, such as the number of radial grid points used to discretize the oscillation equations, are varied; and we summarize this behavior via an idealized error model. While our analysis focuses on the GYRE code, it remains broadly applicable to other oscillation codes.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics with Compact Objects: An Indian Perspective, Present Status and Future Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects, viz., white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, are the remnants of stellar deaths at the end of their life cycles. They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.</description>

      <title>A 3D Monte Carlo calculation of the inverse Compton emission from the Sun and stars in presence of magnetic and electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar steady emission in gamma rays is due to the interactions of Galactic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere and with the low-energy solar photon field via inverse Compton scattering. The emission is sensitive to the magnetic field nearby the Sun and to the cosmic-ray transport in the magnetic field in the inner solar system. Modeling the inverse Compton emission in the presence of a magnetic field is therefore crucial to better interpret the observations. In a previous work we have presented a comprehensive calculation of the secondary productions due to the collision of cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere in presence of magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a general approach to calculate the (anisotropic) inverse Compton scattering in a 3D Monte Carlo simulation, also in presence of magnetic and electric fields. After a short review of the scattering process of photons with electrons, examples of inverse Compton emission are presented, including the predictions for the Sun.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: a new Galactic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Old open clusters can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they suffer from low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old ($\geq$ 500 Myr) clusters from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest open clusters as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old open clusters with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease of metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is well explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different Galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>

      <title>SpecpolFlow: a new software package for spectropolarimetry using Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetry, the observation of polarization and intensity as a function of wavelength, is a powerful tool in stellar astrophysics. It is particularly useful for characterizing stars and circumstellar material, and for tracing the influence of magnetic fields on a host star and its environment. Maintaining modern, flexible, and accessible computational tools that enable spectropolarimetric studies is thus essential. The SpecpolFlow package is a new, completely Pythonic workflow for analyzing stellar spectropolarimetric observations. Its suite of tools provides a user-friendly interface for working with data from an assortment of instruments and telescopes. SpecpolFlow contains tools for spectral normalization and visualization, the extraction of Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) profiles, the generation and optimization of line masks for LSD analyses, and the calculation of longitudinal magnetic field measurements from the LSD profiles. It also provides Python classes for the manipulation of spectropolarimetric products. The SpecpolFlow website includes an array of tutorials that guide users through common analysis cases using the software. SpecpolFlow is distributed as a free, open-source package, with fully documented tools (via an API and command line interface) which are actively maintained by a team of contributors.</description>

      <title>Eccentric millisecond pulsar + subdwarf B star from rotationally delayed accretion-induced-collapse scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star + helium star systems are attracting more and more attentions. Following the rotationally delayed accretion-induced-collapse (RD-AIC) scenario, I predict that there could be eccentric millisecond pulsar + subdwarf B (MSP + sdB), at least eccentric neutron star + subdwarf B (NS + sdB) systems in the Galaxy. I show the predictions on their orbital parameters, including MSP mass, secondary mass, eccentricity and orbital period. Based on two detailed binary population synthesis calculations, we find that their Galactic birth rate is $(0.67-1.5)\times10^{\rm -4}~{\rm yr^{\rm -1}}$. Then, a very conservative upper limit of their number in the Galaxy is 6700-15000. They have an age of hundreds of Myr and then should be discovered in relatively young environments. In addition, most of the MSPs in the eccentric MSP + sdB systems have a mass less massive than 1.5 $M_{\odot}$. I simply discuss their future potential applications in astrophysical fields.</description>

      <title>Orbital Decay of the Shortest-Period Hot Jupiter, TOI-2109b: Tidal Constraints and Transit-Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOI-2109b is the hot Jupiter with the shortest orbital period ($\sim16\,$hr). At this close distance, strong tidal interactions can produce a significant exchange of angular momentum with the star. Since the orbital period of this planet is shorter than the stellar rotation period, TOI-2109b may be an optimal candidate for studying orbital decay. This process depends on how efficiently the star and the planet dissipate energy, due mainly to interior mechanisms that are poorly constrained in exoplanet systems. In this work, we study for the first time the tidal evolution of TOI-2109b under a formalism of inertial waves (IWs) in convective envelopes and internal gravity waves (IGWs) in stellar radiative regions. We find that uncertainties in the age of TOI-2109 ($t_\mathrm{\star, age}$) significantly affect the rate of orbital evolution, as IWs and IGWs interact differently depending on $t_\mathrm{\star, age}$. For an 'old' host star, we find that TOI-2109b would undergo fast orbital decay. Conversely, if TOI-2109b orbits a 'young' host star, a rather slow decay rate for $Q_\star'&gt;2.3\times10^7$ would suggest a constant-period orbit. Our calculated mid-transit times and transit-timing variations (TTVs) support a 'young' host star with $Q_\star'&gt;3.7\times10^7$, suggesting a decay rate of $\dot{P}\sim4\,$ms yr$^{-1}$ that could lead to mid-transit-time shifts $\lesssim10\,$s over three years. Orbital decay and other TTV-inducing effects will be confirmed or ruled out with future higher-quality timing data. The results presented here aim at constraining the current modeling of tides and TTVs for TOI-2109b, helping us further understand those light-curve changes associated to the long-term evolution of ultra-short-period planets.</description>

      <title>EBLM XV -- Revised dynamical masses for the circumbinary planet host Kepler-16 AB, using the SOPHIE spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries are perfect laboratories to measure precise, accurate and model-independent stellar radii and stellar masses, so long as both components are spectroscopically resolved. Resolving both components is difficult in high-contrast binaries, for instance, those composed of an FGK main-sequence star with an M-type companion. In those cases, the secondary can contribute &lt;1% of the total flux in optical wavelengths. This makes measuring dynamical masses challenging and has typically only been attempted with large-aperture telescopes (8-10-m). The High-Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS) method was developed to extract weak emission and transmission spectra for exoplanet atmospheres. This method was recently adapted and applied to measure dynamical masses in high-contrast binaries. In this work, we apply the HRCCS method to optical spectra of the high-contrast binary and circumbinary planet host Kepler-16AB, obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The secondary, which has a contrast ratio of ~ 6 x 10-3, is resolved with a detection significance of 9.5-sigma. We derive dynamical masses with a precision of 1.5% and 0.9% for the primary and secondary respectively. These are comparable, but slightly higher (within 2-7%) to previous mass-measurements, which has -- within the uncertainties -- no implication for the mass of the known circumbinary planet. This work demonstrates that dynamical mass measurements of high-contrast binaries can be done with 2-m class telescopes. We also investigate different analysis protocols to ensure we derive robust uncertainties for dynamical masses.</description>

      <title>Impact of &lt;3D&gt; NLTE on GCE of oxygen with the RAdial Velocity Experiment</title>

Abstract: Stellar abundances, coupled with kinematics are a unique way to understand the chemo-dynamical processes that occurred to build the Milky Way and its local volume as we observe today. However, measuring abundances is challenging as one needs to properly address the effect of departure from the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as well as the commonly used 1-dimensional model atmosphere. In this work, we constrain the chemical evolution of [O/Fe] in FG stars of the RAVE survey with [O/Fe] abundances derived in non-LTE (NLTE) and with horizontally-temporally-averaged 3D (&lt;3D&gt;) model atmospheres. Using standard spectral fitting method, we determine for the first time LTE and NLTE [O/Fe] ratios from the O triplet at 8446A in turn-off and dwarf stars thanks to intermediate-resolution RAVE spectra, assuming both 1D and &lt;3D&gt; model atmosphere. NLTE effects play a significant role when determining oxygen even at a resolution of R= 7500. Typical NLTE-LTE corrections of the order of -0.12 dex are measured in dwarfs and turn-off stars using 1D MARCS models. In contrast to applying &lt;3D&gt; NLTE abundance corrections or the classical 1D LTE, the full &lt;3D&gt; NLTE spectral fitting yields improving the precision of abundances by nearly 10%. We show that the decrease of [O/Fe] in the super-solar [Fe/H] regime is rather characterised by a flat trend when [O/Fe] is computed in &lt;3D&gt; NLTE from full spectral fitting. We attribute this flattening at super-solar [Fe/H] to the interplay between locally born stars with negative [O/Fe] and stars migrated from the inner MW regions with super-solar [O/Fe], supporting the complex chemo-dynamical history of the Solar neighbourhood. Our results are key for understanding the effects of &lt;3D&gt; and NLTE when measuring [O/Fe]. This work is a test bed for the analysis of 4MOST low-resolution spectra that will share similar properties as RAVE in the red wavelength domain.</description>

      <title>Comparing Grid Model Fitting Methodologies for Low-Temperature Atmospheres: Markov Chain Monte Carlo versus Random Forest Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheres of low-temperature stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets are challenging to model due to strong molecular features and complex gas and condensate chemistry. Self-consistent atmosphere models are commonly used for spectral fitting, but computational limits restrict the production of finely-sampled multi-dimensional parameter grids, necessitating interpolation methods to infer precise parameters and uncertainties. Here, we compare two grid-model fitting approaches: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm interpolating across spectral fluxes, and a Random Forest Retrieval (RFR) algorithm trained on a grid model set. We test these with three low-temperature model grids -- Sonora Diamondback, Sonora Elf Owl, and Spectral ANalog of Dwarfs (SAND) -- and a sample of eleven L and T dwarf companions to FGKM stars with known distances, compositions, and ages. Diamondback models are optimal for early- and mid-type L dwarfs, Elf Owl for mid- and late T dwarfs, and SAND for young L dwarfs and L/T transition objects. The MCMC approach yields higher fit quality and more precise parameters, though best-fit parameters are generally consistent between approaches. RFR analysis is orders of magnitude faster after training. Both approaches yield mixed results when comparing fit parameters to expected values based on primary (metallicity and surface gravity) or evolutionary models (temperature and radius). We propose modeling low-temperature spectra efficiently by first fitting multiple model sets using RFR, followed by a more accurate MCMC assessment, to accelerate improved grid development.</description>

      <title>Cold Jupiters and small planets: friends, foes, or indifferent? A search for correlations with the largest exoplanet samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding out whether there is any correlation between the presence of short-period small planets (SPs) with $P\lesssim100~d$ ($a \lesssim0.4~AU$) and $1&lt;M_{p}&lt;20~M_\oplus$ and that of outer cold Jupiters (CJs) with $a=1-10~AU$ and $M_{p}=0.5-20~M_{Jup}$ around solar-type stars may provide crucial constraints on the models of formation and/or migration of SPs. However, somehow discrepant results about the occurrence rates of CJs in SP systems have been reported in the literature, with a few recent works claiming a strong SP-CJ correlation but only at super-solar metallicity and/or mass of the host stars. Here we homogeneously recomputed the occurrence rates of CJs at average, sub-solar ($[Fe/H]&lt;-0.1$), solar ($-0.1\le[Fe/H]\le0.1$), and super-solar ($[Fe/H]&gt;0.1$) metallicity as well as at average and sub-intervals of stellar mass, namely 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, and 1.0-1.2 $M_\odot$, with (i) a carefully-selected sample of 217 SP systems, and (ii) a large comparison sample of 1167 solar-type stars. We determined the integrated occurrence rate of CJs in SP systems to be $f_{CJ|SP}=11.1^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\%$; this is consistent with the estimated frequencies of CJs in both the comparison sample ($f_{CJ}=9.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\%$) and the HARPS-N survey of transiting SP systems. We found a possible correlation ($f_{CJ|SP}&gt;f_{CJ}$) only at super-solar mass and metallicity, though with a statistical confidence less than $3\sigma$. To test some theoretical predictions, we also searched for possible SP-CJ relations as a function of SP and CJ multiplicity as well as SP composition, and found none. We show that the architectures of SP systems are not indifferent to the presence of CJs as the multiplicity of SPs strongly depends on the CJ eccentricity, as expected from planetary dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the relation between SPs and CJs requires larger samples of SP systems. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>DRAGyS -- A comprehensive tool to extract scattering phase functions in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stages of planet formation, involving dust grain growth and planetesimals formation, remain shrouded in mystery. The analysis of the Scattering Phase Function (SPF) measured in disks surrounding young stars holds great potential for revealing crucial information about dust grain properties. Given the increasing number of high-quality datasets available, an efficient method to extract the SPF is required. DRAGyS is a tool designed for the quick and comprehensive analysis of ring-shaped protoplanetary disks. It directly estimates the disk geometry and extracts the total and polarized SPF from scattered light images, without requiring any radiative transfer modeling, a limitation of previous efforts. Key disk parameters (inclination, position angle, aspect ratio) are obtained by fitting ellipses to the disk intensity peaks from the ring surface, assuming the disks are circular. We validated the method using simulated disk images and then applied it to archival polarized-intensity images of nine images for six protoplanetary disks. DRAGyS provides a method to correct for the effect of limb brightening on the SPF. DRAGyS recovers well the injected geometry and the SPF from synthetic images where the parameters are known. When compared to previously published results extracted from images without considering limb brightening, DRAGyS yields similar results for the inclination, position angle, and SPF. We show that the effect of limb brightening on the SPF is significant, with consequences for the inference of dust properties. DRAGyS takes advantage of a fast and purely geometrical approach to estimate ringed-disk geometries. It allows the efficient extraction of SPF either globally or by sectors, allowing it to deal with disk asymmetries. By bypassing the need for a full modeling of the disk geometry before SPF extraction, DRAGyS is well suited to study large samples of disk images.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sagittarius stream with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is one of the most prominent satellites of the Milky Way (MW). It is currently undergoing tidal disruption, forming an extensive stellar stream that provides key insights into the assembly history of the MW halo. In this study we analyzed RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in the Sgr stream provided in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), for which new estimates of photometric metallicities are available in the literature, and accurate distances were calculated using the reddening-free period-Wesenheit-metallicity ($PWZ$) relation. We determine the mean metallicity of RRLs in the Sgr stream to be ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.62 \pm 0.01$ dex. We measure a metallicity gradient as a function of stripping time from the Sgr progenitor of $0.05 \pm 0.02$ dex/Gyr, indicating that the metal-poor RRLs were stripped earlier during the accretion process. The far arm is found to be the most metal-poor structure of the Sgr stream, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.98 \pm 0.37$ dex, significantly lower than that of the leading ($-1.69\pm0.31$ dex) and trailing ($-1.64 \pm 0.28$ dex) arms. Our findings show that the RRLs in the far arm of the Sgr stream exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]=$-2.4$ dex and $-1.7$ dex. The main body of the stream is the most metal-rich structure, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.58 \pm 0.31$ dex and a radial gradient of $-0.008 \pm 0.005$ dex/kpc. We find almost negligible metallicity gradients of $(-0.2 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the trailing arm and $(-1.0 \pm 0.5)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the leading arm, in agreement with previous studies. Finally, we investigate the bifurcation of the Sgr stream and conclude that the metallicity difference between the faint and bright branches is not confirmed based on the RRLs in our sample.</description>

      <title>Why Do Stars Turn Red? I. Post-Main-Sequence Expansion Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question: Why do post-main-sequence stars evolve into red giants (RGs) or red supergiants (RSGs)? Using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, we perform numerical experiments to compare stellar models that successfully transition into RGs/RSGs with those that remain blue. We identify the key physical criteria and mechanisms that govern envelope expansion when stars evolve from the core hydrogen-burning to helium-burning stage. We propose that the expansion is governed by a refined version of the "mirror principle": the stellar envelope consistently moves in the opposite direction to the outer edge of the hydrogen-burning shell (i.e., the shell-envelope boundary), rather than to the helium core. Instead of the simple energy absorption in the envelope proposed in previous studies to drive the expansion, this modified mirror principle naturally arises from hydrostatic equilibrium, as the burning shell sets a constant-pressure boundary that moves inward or outward. Following this principle, we identify two evolutionary pathways to the RG/RSG phase: (1) direct expansion during the helium core contraction, as the burning shell keeps moving inward along with the core; and (2) continued envelope expansion after core contraction halts, regulated by a sustained decrease in nuclear energy generation rate, accompanied by the inward motion of the shell-envelope boundary. Additionally, we identify a structural transition that occurs in the envelope during the final approach to the RG/RSG phase, characterized by mass redistribution and changes in gas opacity in the envelope. These results provide a unified physical framework for understanding the post-main-sequence envelope expansion and the formation of RGs/RSGs.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. We speculate that the statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>The Sun's open-closed flux boundary and the origin of the slow solar wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun's open-closed flux boundary (OCB) separates closed and open magnetic field lines, and is the site for interchange magnetic reconnection processes thought to be linked to the origin of the slow solar wind (SSW). We analyze the global magnetic field structure and OCB from 2010 December to 2019 December using three coronal magnetic field models: a potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model, a static equilibrium magnetofrictional model, and a time-dependent magnetofrictional model. We analyze the model and cycle dependence of the OCB length on the photosphere, as well as the magnetic flux in the vicinity of the OCB. Near solar maximum, the coronal magnetic field for each model consists predominantly of long, narrow coronal holes, and nearly all the open flux lies within 1 supergranule diameter (25 Mm) of the OCB. By comparing to interplanetary scintillation measurements of SSW speeds, we argue that the fraction of open flux within this 25 Mm band is a good predictor of the amount of SSW in the heliosphere. Importantly, despite its simplicity, we show that the PFSS model estimates this fraction as well as the time-dependent model. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding SSW origins and interchange reconnection at the OCB.</description>

      <title>Adding further pieces to the synchronization puzzle: QBO, bimodality, and phase jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work builds on a recently developed self-consistent synchronization model of the solar dynamo which attempts to explain Rieger-type periods, the Schwabe/Hale cycle and the Suess-de Vries and Gleissberg cycles in terms of resonances of various wave phenomena with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets. We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides of the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter excite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action of the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07 years, the main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period of 1.723 years. Our dynamo model provides oscillations with exactly that period, which is also typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Most remarkable is its agreement with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events which preferentially occur in the positive phase of an oscillation with a period of 1.724 years. While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a general feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under the influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar activity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars. We also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180 degrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-year beat period is rather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves and prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an alternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related data from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to optimal growth conditions.</description>

      <title>Which is the most eccentric binary known? Insights from the 2023/4 pericenter passages of Zeta Bo\"otis and Eta Ophiuchi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a clear dearth of very eccentric binaries among those for which individual eccentricities can be measured. In this paper we report on observations of the two nearby, bright and very eccentric visual binaries Zeta Bo\"otis ($\zeta$ Boo) and Eta Ophiuchi ($\eta$ Oph), for which VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric observations were obtained during their pericenter passages in 2023/4. Previous observations of $\zeta$ Boo suggest an eccentricity $e&gt;0.99$ with high significance, implying that it has the highest eccentricity of any known binary. However, our interferometric measurements near periastron passage reveal that the eccentricity is actually $e=0.980450\pm0.000064$ (second highest well constrained eccentricity) with a pericenter distance $a_p=0.818\pm0.009\text{ au}$. We attribute the previous over-estimation to a degeneracy that plagues very eccentric visual binary orbital solutions. For $\eta$ Oph we find an eccentricity $e=0.93077\pm0.00013$ (compared to previous estimates of $e=0.95\pm 0.02$), a pericenter distance $a_p=2.15\pm0.10 \text{ au}$ and attribute the over-estimated dynamical mass in the previous solution to an underestimated error in the semi-major axis. With no additional close companions capable of influencing their further evolution, both systems are expected to fully circularize as the stars evolve and expand, ultimately leading to close circular binaries with no memory of their very eccentric past.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WISE 0855-0714 is the coldest known brown dwarf, located 2.28 pc from the solar system. Discovered by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2014 (Luhman 2014), the object is of interest to scientists because of its low temperature ($\approx270$ K), proximity to the solar system, small mass ($\sim3-10\: M_{J}$), and high proper motion. The first observations of W0855 by WISE in 2010 are heavily contaminated by a background source. With 10.5 years of observations following the NEOWISE reactivation in 2013 (Mainzer et al., 2014), we present a robust analysis of W0855's flux and color unobstructed by this background source. We obtain W1 = 19.3 and W1-W2 = 5.4 magnitudes with an error of 0.37 magnitudes.</description>

Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations in MOCCA globular cluster models: Transient spatial over-concentration of pristine red giant stars driven by strong dynamical encounters</title>

Abstract: Recent findings show that, in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars are more centrally concentrated than enriched RGB stars. This contradicts most multiple-population formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be more concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model that exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars at 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution scenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our results indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple populations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by dynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB progenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration of 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs with present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 - 20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young due to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone significant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively small number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the spatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to biased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent over-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect driven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical encounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB scenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as NGC 3201 and NGC 6101.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Shell Structure in the Primary Outflow from IRAS 15398-3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications. A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow. When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.</description>
