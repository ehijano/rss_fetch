      <title>Fabry-Perot-Insensitive Edge Coupling for Robust PIC Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities formed between a fiber array and a silicon chip during edge-coupled testing of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our results show that subwavelength variations in the distance between the fiber array and the device under test induce coupling efficiency modulations of several tenths of a decibel - challenging current alignment precision and undermining measurement repeatability in wafer-level probing. To address these FP-induced fluctuations, we introduce a complementary dual-measurement technique that shifts the chip-fiber separation by a quarter wavelength, thereby generating phase-opposite modulation artifacts that cancel upon averaging. This approach allows a higher tolerance in probe-to-PIC positioning by substantially eliminating the FP modulation. We also demonstrate how it can be leveraged to enhance repeatability and accurate positioning during alignment, reducing the insertion loss variability between multiple measurements from 0.34 to 0.04 dB. Such precision is essential for emerging applications like quantum photonics, silicon photonic sensors, and high-bandwidth optical interconnects where measurement accuracy directly impacts device performance characterization. Ultimately, our method offers a robust and accurate solution for high-throughput PIC characterization without requiring index-matching gel, which is impractical for wafer-level testing.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers as a tool for quantitative imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers equipped with position detection allow for application of piconewton-scale forces and high-temporal-resolution measurements of nanometer-scale motion. While typically used for trapping microscopic objects, the optical tweezer detection pathway can also be used for a microscopy technique sensitive to nanometer-sized structures. Optical tweezers most commonly use back-focal-plane detection to determine the position of the trapped object. This technique involves analyzing the interference pattern between scattered and unscattered light. Despite the reliance on interference, we show that an image of an extended object can be understood as a sum of the images of individual point-like particles that make up the object. This allows for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane detection to be used as an imaging tool capable of determining the mass distribution of scanned structures. Furthermore, the sample-orientation-dependent detector response allows for a unique method of background subtraction. We demonstrate the quantitative imaging capabilities of optical tweezer microscopy by determining the size distributions multiple nearby particles and measuring the changing diameter of collagen fibrils. The background subtraction technique is demonstrated by imaging surface-bound microtubules with a strong background from protein aggregate co-adsorption. Optical tweezer microscopy allows for quantitative imaging of objects far from the coverslip surface. This makes it an excellent tool for studying the link between the structure and mechanics of microscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Precise control of the phase-transition temperature of VO2 from 70 to -35 {\deg}C for tunable optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the combination of metal doping and ion bombardment as a hybrid technique to precisely engineer the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) films. This approach enables (i) setting the phase-transition temperature ($T_c$) from $-35$ to $70$ {\deg}C, (ii) near-zero hysteresis in highly doped and irradiated films, and (iii) robust optical contrast across a broad range of doping and irradiation conditions, down to $T_c = -35$ {\deg}C. While previous work has focused on engineering the IMT via one of metal doping or ion irradiation, our hybrid method utilizes both. In doing so, we address several lingering challenges in VO$_2$ engineering, including the trade-off between $T_c$ reduction and optical contrast, and limitations in the achievable value of T$_c$. Strain$-T_c$ correlation from XRD and Raman measurements suggests a common mechanism behind doping- and irradiation-induced $T_c$ reduction. The ability to reduce the $T_c$ and hysteresis of VO$_2$ while maintaining large optical contrast will extend the functionality of VO$_2$-based optical and optoelectronic devices, including detectors, limiters, and modulators.</description>

      <title>High-density three-dimensional holography using rapid modulation of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most common methods for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) images of real objects is digital holography. This technique relies on the use of electro-optical devices that modify the phase or amplitude of light fields in a controlled manner, the so-called spatial light modulators. However, given that holography typically requires coherent light sources, a common problem with three-dimensional projection is the crosstalk between the layers that make up the 3D object. This limits full-depth control and directly affects image quality. Interestingly, in the past few years, several methods have proven to be effective in breaking layer crosstalk by erasing the spatial coherence of light. A drawback of such solutions is that, in many cases, additional optical resources are required to achieve such a task. In this work, we present a method for high-density reconstruction of three-dimensional objects using rapid modulation of light fields by means of digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The 3D reconstruction is performed by discretizing the object into multiplane light-point contours, where the resolution of the contours is controlled by the density of the light points. This allows us to achieve point separations, in the transverse plane, as small as 100 $\mu$m. The high refresh rate of the DMD ($\sim 10$ kHz) allows for a reconstruction where each point of the 3D image is spatially and temporally controlled by independent amplitude holograms, thus effectively eliminating coherence-induced multiplane crosstalk without the need for additional optical elements. Because of its simplicity and versatility, we believe that our method provides a practical route toward compact, high-resolution 3D holographic projectors.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and interfering resonances in isolated van der Waals nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of strong light-matter interaction in van der Waals materials is at the forefront of current research in physics and chemistry, and it can be enhanced dramatically by employing resonances. Here we present the first observation of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) realized via polaritonic interfering resonances in isolated WS$_2$ nanodisks. We experimentally validate the existence of polaritonic qBICs driven by intrinsic coupling of Mie resonances and excitons. The system exhibits exceptionally strong light-matter interaction with a measured Rabi splitting exceeding 310 meV - the largest reported value among all transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) self-hybridized systems to date. The giant coupling strength stems from qBIC-induced in-plane field enhancement, which strongly interacts with in-plane excitonic dipoles while suppressing radiative losses. Polarization-controlled measurements further demonstrate selective excitation of qBIC through switching incident polarization to specific orthogonal configurations. The observed polarization-dependent coupling provides an additional degree of freedom to control over the hybrid states' spectral characteristics and spatial field distributions. Our demonstrations provide a pathway for engineering high-quality light-matter hybrid states in compact nanostructures, with potential applications in on-chip photonics, polaritonics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Designing lensless imaging systems to maximize information capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mask-based lensless imaging uses an optical encoder (e.g. a phase or amplitude mask) to capture measurements, then a computational decoding algorithm to reconstruct images. In this work, we evaluate and design encoders based on the information content of their measurements using mutual information estimation. With this approach, we formalize the object-dependent nature of lensless imaging and study the interdependence between object sparsity, encoder multiplexing, and noise. Our analysis reveals that optimal encoder designs should tailor encoder multiplexing to object sparsity for maximum information capture, and that all optimally-encoded measurements share the same level of sparsity. Using mutual information-based optimization, we design information-optimal encoders with improved downstream reconstruction performance. We validate the benefits of reduced multiplexing for dense, natural images by evaluating experimental lensless imaging systems directly from captured measurements, without the need for image formation models, reconstruction algorithms, or ground truth images. Our comprehensive analysis establishes design and engineering principles for improving lensless imaging systems, and offers a model for the study of general multiplexing systems, especially those with object-dependent performance.</description>

      <title>Breaking Kirchhoff's Law in Nonlinear Thermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiation is strictly governed by Kirchhoff s law to reach thermal equilibrium. The violation of Kirchhoff s law decouples nonreciprocally the equity between absorptivity and emissivity, enabling exotic thermal engineering applications. However, achieving broadband nonreciprocal thermal emissivity and absorptivity remains a challenge. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal and broadband thermal radiation by breaking Kirchhoff s law through nonlinear optical frequency conversion in a scattering medium. Thermal blackbody radiation is upconverted through sum-frequency generation with an intense infrared pump, while broadband conversion is enabled by the critical random quasi-phase-matching condition in the nonlinear nanocrystals. Moreover, a temporal transient measurement also indicates a possible active radiation cooling through such nonlinear thermal radiation. These results may pave a new way for nonlinear and active thermal management in critical applications like radiation cooling, energy harvesting, and infrared camouflage.</description>

      <title>High-throughput polarization-independent spatial mode shaping with mode-selective photonic lanterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08595v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent interference in multimode photonic systems offers a transformative approach for scalable, high-fidelity optical control, enabling precise beam shaping, efficient power delivery, and advanced signal processing through single-mode performance. Current techniques are often constrained to a single polarization state of light, system complexity, and the fabrication challenges associated with precise waveguide structures. Here, we present a high-efficiency coherent combination scheme employing a commercial mode-selective photonic lantern supporting three spatial channels, achieving Gaussian mode interference at multiple locations along the multimode core with up to 100% mode conversion efficiencies. By integrating a Faraday reflecting fibre component and piezo-phase shifters with the photonic lantern channels, we demonstrate stable and adaptive mode manipulation without the need for complex adaptive optics. These findings highlight the potential of photonic lanterns as robust platforms for controlled mode interference, paving the way for their deployment in next-generation optical communication, beam shaping, and beam-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Visible Brillouin-quadratic microlaser in a high-Q thin-film lithium niobate microdisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth lasers at short/visible wavelengths are crucial for quantum and atomic applications, such as atomic clocks, quantum computing, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and quantum sensing. However, such lasers are often only accessible in bulky tabletop systems and remain scarce in integrated photonic platform. Here, we report an on-chip visible Brillouin-quadratic microlaser in a 117-um-diameter thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) microdisk via dispersion engineering. Enabled by the ultra-high Q factor of 4.0X10(6) and small mode volume, strong photon-phonon interaction and high second-order nonlinearity of the TFLN microdisk, narrow-linewidth Stokes Brillouin lasing (SBL) is demonstrated with 10.17 GHz Brillouin shift under a 1560-nm pump, exhibiting a short-term narrow linewidth of 254 Hz and a low threshold of only 1.81 mW. Meanwhile, efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) of the SBL signal is also observed at 780 nm, with a normalized conversion efficiency of 3.61%/mW, made possible by simultaneous phase matching fulfillments for both narrow-linewidth SBL and its SHG. This demonstration of an integrated ultra-narrow linewidth visible wavelength Brillouin-quadratic lasers opens new avenues toward chip-scale quantum information processing and precise metrology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tunable, continuous-wave (CW) laser system emitting at 213 nm, based on the frequency quadrupling of a single Ti:sapph laser. The setup features two sequential, cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) stages. The first stage uses an LBO crystal and achieves a conversion efficiency of over 80%, yielding up to 3.3 W at 426 nm. The second stage employs a Brewster-cut BBO crystal with an elliptical beam waist to mitigate UV-induced degradation, producing up to 130 mW of deep UV light. The system demonstrates stable operation over several hours and is well suited for applications in atomic physics, spectroscopy, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Probing Strong-Field QED via Angle-Discriminated Emissions from Electrons Traversing Colliding Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future laser-electron colliders will reach quantum parameters $\chi$ well in excess of unity, enabling studies of strong-field QED in extreme regimes. However, statistical inference in such experiments requires mitigating premature radiative losses of electrons to enable high-$\chi$ QED events, as well as separating the detectable signal of these events from that of lower-$\chi$ particles and photons produced by QED cascades. We propose a collider geometry in which electrons traverse the waist of two or four perpendicularly propagating, tightly focused laser pulses. This configuration suppresses both outlined difficulties by leveraging the short interaction length of the waist, rather than relying on the more technically demanding reduction of pulse duration. Moreover, altering the phase and polarization of each pulse causes the electrons to undergo helical motion where the deflection angle is correlated with the field strength, permitting an angle-based discrimination of the signal from high-$\chi$ events. Analysis and simulations show that the case of four circularly polarized pulses uniquely permits achieving helical motion throughout the entire focal region, leading to near-perfect high-$\chi$ angle-discrimination and thereby high signal-to-noise ratio. These findings support the consideration of the proposed concept as a viable layout for future experiments at PW laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Exciton Delocalization Suppresses Polariton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons (EPs) are part-light part-matter quasiparticles that combine large exciton-mediated nonlinearities with long-range coherence, ideal for energy harvesting and nonlinear optics. Optimizing EPs for these applications is predicated on a still-elusive understanding of how disorder affects their propagation and dephasing times. Here, using cutting-edge femtosecond spatiotemporal microscopy, we directly image EP propagation at light-like speeds in systems ranging from two-dimensional semiconductors to amorphous molecular films with systematically varied exciton-phonon coupling, exciton delocalization, and static disorder. Despite possessing similar EP dispersions, we observe dramatically different transport velocities and scattering times across systems. We establish a robust scaling law linking EP scattering to exciton transfer integral, demonstrating that polaritons based on materials with large exciton bandwidths are immune to disorder even for highly excitonic EPs. This observation cannot be deduced from the systems' linear optical properties, including EP dispersion and linewidth disorder. Our work highlights the critical and often-overlooked role of the matter component in dictating polariton properties, and provides precise guidelines for simultaneously optimizing EP propagation and nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Direct interferometric measurement of non-reciprocity induced by a plasmonic metasurface with false chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is an important scientific concept related to the broken symmetry of light propagation through a system in forward and reverse directions. This effect lies in the origin of various applications including signal processing, noise reduction, unidirectional propagation and sensing. Here we show that propagation of Surface Plasmons (SP) within a structure having a false chirality exhibits a non-reciprocity. The SP waves propagating in opposite directions within the structure acquire opposite Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases. To detect this phase difference we introduce a novel interferometric technique based on a customized Sagnac set-up. The main advantages of our proposed system are high sensitivity to non-reciprocal phase changes, high precision incidence angle alignment and the inspection of the k-space enabled by sufficiently wide range of incidence angles. We believe that a pivotal role of the non-reciprocity and its detection in numerous physical and chemical processes suggests a wide range of practical applications as well as deeper scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Optical Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, in the full vector formulation of electromagnetic fields, that the well-known optical theorem pertinent for the characterization of a scatterer's extinction power and associated cross section can be expressed in a multitude of alternative equivalent forms. These alternatives involve different forms of projective field measurements or detectors. The inherent nonuniqueness of such optical-theorem-based detectors stems from the nonuniqueness of an associated inverse source problem, and can be interpreted via well-known equivalence principles. Some of the multiple ways in which the extinction of power due to the interaction of a scattering body with a probing field can be measured remotely are derived and interpreted for a number of canonical frameworks. This includes detectors and their corresponding optical theorems synthesized in the contexts of surface-confined sensors for near-field sensing, surface sensors based on backpropagation-based imaging, a number of planar aperture realizations dealt with through classical diffraction theory, as well as detectors based on multipole representations. General aspects of the derived optical theorems are discussed in the context of envisioned practical applications.</description>

      <title>A study of cross-relaxation and temporal dynamics of lasing at 2 microns in Thulium doped ceramic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the characterization of the pump absorption and emission dynamic properties of a \tulio{} ceramic lasing medium using a three mirrors folded laser cavity. We measured a slope efficiency of 73\%, which allowed us to retrieve the cross-relaxation coefficient. The behavior of our system was modeled via a set of macroscopic rate equations in both the quasi continuous wave and the pulsed pumping regime. Numerical solutions were obtained, showing a good agreement with the experimental findings. The numerical solution also yielded a cross-relaxation coefficient in very good agreement with the measured one, showing that the cross-relaxation phenomenon approaches the maximum theoretical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Photon-resolved Floquet theory approach to spectroscopic quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic methods play a vital role in quantum sensing, which uses the quantized nature of atoms or molecules to reach astonishing precision for sensing of, e.g., electric or magnetic fields. In the theoretical treatment, one typically invokes semiclassical methods to describe the light-matter interaction between quantum emitters, e.g., atoms or molecules, and a strong coherent laser field. However, these semiclassical approaches struggle to predict the stochastic measurement fluctuations beyond the mean value, necessary to predict the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) which is capable to predict the measurement statistics describing higher order statistics of coherent quantum states of light. The PRFT constructs flow equations for the cumulants of the photonic measurement statistics utilizing only the semiclassical dynamics of the matter system. We apply the PRFT to spectroscopic quantum sensing using dissipative two-level and four-level systems (describing electric field sensing with Rydberg atoms), and demonstrate how to calculate the Fisher information of the measurement statistics with respect to various system parameters. In doing so, we demonstrate that the PRFT is a flexible tool allowing to improve the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing devices by several orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08454v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</description>

      <title>Edge burst effect and scale-free localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian edge burst is a phenomenon observed in non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, characterized by a significant accumulation of loss at the boundaries of a system. We present an example of the edge burst effect in a lossy lattice with bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). By introducing a weak coupling between two such non-Hermitian lattices, we demonstrate that the system exhibits bipolar scale-free localization. Through an analysis of local decay distributions and their sensitivity to system parameters, we confirm the occurrence of the edge burst effect in the system displaying scale-free localization. Our findings support the notion that the skin effect is not a necessary condition for the edge burst effect.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezer-controlled entanglement gates with trapped ion qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an entanglement protocol where ions illuminated by optical tweezers serve as control qubits. We experimentally demonstrate this proposal with a controlled M$\o$lmer-S$\o$rensen operation on a three-ion chain, analogous to the canonical Toffoli gate. Our demonstration features cases in which the control qubit was in one of its logical basis states, and not in their superposition, due to dephasing by tweezer beam intensity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our protocol generalizes to a broad class of unitary operations and larger qubit systems, enabling a single-pulse implementation of $n$-controlled unitaries.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with slowly-varying envelope (parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure, and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Online training and pruning of multi-wavelength photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are emerging as a promising platform in artificial intelligence (AI) computing. Owing to the compact footprint of microring resonators (MRRs) and the enhanced interconnect efficiency enabled by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), MRR-based photonic neural networks (PNNs) are particularly promising for large-scale integration. However, the scalability and energy efficiency of such systems are fundamentally limited by the MRR resonance wavelength variations induced by fabrication process variations (FPVs) and environmental fluctuations. Existing solutions use post-fabrication approaches or thermo-optic tuning, incurring high control power and additional process complexity. In this work, we introduce an online training and pruning method that addresses this challenge, adapting to FPV-induced and thermally induced shifts in MRR resonance wavelength. By incorporating a power-aware pruning term into the conventional loss function, our approach simultaneously optimizes the PNN accuracy and the total power consumption for MRR tuning. In proof-of-concept on-chip experiments on the Iris dataset, our system PNNs can adaptively train to maintain a 96% classification accuracy, while achieving a 44.7% reduction in tuning power via pruning. Additionally, our approach reduces the power consumption by orders-of-magnitude on larger datasets. By addressing chip-to-chip variation and minimizing power requirements, our approach significantly improves the scalability and energy efficiency of MRR-based integrated analog photonic processors, paving the way for large-scale PICs to enable versatile applications including neural networks, photonic switching, LiDAR, and radio-frequency beamforming.</description>

      <title>Isolated attosecond spatio-temporal optical vortices: Interplay between the topological charge and orbital angular momentum scaling in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation properties and the nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) open new scenarios in high-harmonic generation (HHG), where the richness of the topological charge and OAM up-conversion are exposed. Through advanced numerical simulations, we demonstrate that HHG driven by spatio-spectral optical vortices produces far-field, extreme-ultraviolet STOV harmonics with non-scaling topological charge, i.e., with the same topological charge. This allows for the generation of attosecond STOVs, in contrast to previous works of HHG driven by STOVs, where the topological charge scales with the harmonic order. Our findings evidence that the scaling of the topological charge in HHG driven by spatio-temoral topological fields is not generally connected to that of the up-converted OAM. The up-converted intrinsic OAM does scale with generality with harmonic order in HHG, albeit this scaling does not necessarily imply its conservation.</description>
