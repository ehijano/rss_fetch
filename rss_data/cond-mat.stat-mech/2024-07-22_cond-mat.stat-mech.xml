      <title>The vanishing of heat capacity as thermodynamic third law implies existence of singular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A corollary of the third law of thermodynamics is that the heat capacities of a system approach zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero Kevin. Many have attempted to take the corollary as the third law, but two counterexamples has been constructed explicitly. We present a theorem that the vanishing of heat capacity as the third law implies an existence of singular systems, and two known counterexamples are illustrations of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Field Theoretic Renormalization Group in an Infinite-Dimensional Model of Random Surface Growth in Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of a random environment on the dynamics of a fluctuating rough surface is investigated using a field theoretic renormalization group. The environment motion is modelled by the stochastic Navier--Stokes equation, which includes both a fluid in thermal equilibrium and a turbulent fluid. The surface is described by the generalized Pavlik's stochastic equation. As a result of fulfilling the renormalizability requirement, the model necessarily involves an infinite number of coupling constants. The one-loop counterterm is derived in an explicit closed form. The corresponding renormalization group equations demonstrate the existence of three two-dimensional surfaces of fixed points in the infinite-dimensional parameter space. If the surfaces contain IR attractive regions, the problem allows for the large-scale, long-time scaling behaviour. For the first surface (advection is irrelevant) the critical dimensions of the height field $\Delta_{h}$, the response field $\Delta_{h'}$ and the frequency $\Delta_{\omega}$ are non-universal through the dependence on the effective couplings. For the other two surfaces (advection is relevant) the dimensions are universal and they are found exactly.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of interspecies interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the entropy dissipation is proven by means of an H-functional prescribing the relaxation of the distribution functions to the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Fourier's law breakdown for the planar-rotor chain with long-range coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, of a homogeneous chain of generically-ranged interacting planar rotors, more precisely the inertial $\alpha-XY$ model, is numerically studied with the coupling constant decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$. The conductance ($\sigma\equiv \kappa/L$) is calculated for typical values of $\alpha$, temperature $T$ and lattice size $L$. For large $L$, the results can be collapsed into an universal $q$-stretched exponential form, namely $L^{\delta_{\alpha}} \sigma \propto e_{q_{\alpha}}^{-B_{\alpha}(L^{\gamma_{\alpha}}T)^{\eta_{\alpha}}}$, where $e_q^z\equiv [1+ (1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$. The parameters $(\gamma_{\alpha},\delta_{\alpha},B_{\alpha}, \eta_{\alpha})$ are $\alpha$-dependent, and $q_{\alpha}$ is the index of the $q$-stretched exponential. This form is achievable due to the ratio $\eta_{\alpha}/(q-1)$ being almost constant with respect to the lattice size $L$. Two distinct regimes are identified: for $0 \le \alpha &lt; 2$, the Fourier law is violated, whereas for $\alpha\ge 2$, it is satisfied. These findings provide significant insights into heat conduction mechanisms in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Universality in the dynamical phase transitions of Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) appearing for a single Brownian particle without drift. We first explore how first-order DPTs in large deviations can be found even for a single Brownian particle without any force upon raising the dimension to higher than four. The DPTs accompany temporal phase separations in their dynamical paths, which we numerically confirm by fitting to scaling functions. We next investigate how second-order DPTs can appear in one-dimensional free Brownian motion by choosing the observable, which essentially captures the localization transition of the trajectories. We discuss and confirm that the DPTs predicted for high dimensions can also be found when considering many Brownian particles at lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Channel-facilitated transport under resetting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of particles through channels holds immense significance in physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. For instance, the motion of solutes through biological channels is facilitated by specialized proteins that create water-filled channels and valuable insights can be obtained by studying the transition paths of particles through a channel and gathering statistics on their lifetimes within the channel or their exit probabilities. In a similar vein, we consider a one-dimensional model of channel-facilitated transport where a diffusive particle is subject to attractive interactions with the walls within a limited region of the channel. We study the statistics of conditional and unconditional escape times, in the presence of resetting--an intermittent dynamics that brings the particle back to its initial coordinate randomly. We determine analytically the physical conditions under which such resetting mechanism can become beneficial for faster escape of the particles from the channel thus enhancing the transport. Our theory has been verified with the aid of Brownian dynamics simulations for various interaction strengths and extent. The overall results presented herein highlight the scope of resetting-based strategies to be universally promising for complex transport processes of single or long molecules through biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in the symmetric exclusion process beyond the one-dimensional geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP) is a paradigmatic model of transport, both in and out-of-equilibrium. In this model, the study of currents and their fluctuations has attracted a lot of attention. In finite systems of arbitrary dimension, both the integrated current through a bond (or a fixed surface), and its fluctuations, grow linearly with time. Conversely, for infinite systems, the integrated current displays different behaviours with time, depending on the geometry of the lattice. For instance, in 1D the integrated current fluctuations are known to grow sublinearly with time, as $\sqrt{t}$. Here we study the fluctuations of the integrated current through a given lattice bond beyond the 1D case by considering a SEP on higher-dimensional lattices, and on a comb lattice which describes an intermediate situation between 1D and 2D. We show that the different behaviours of the current originate from qualitatively and quantitatively different current-density correlations in the systems, which we compute explicitly.</description>

      <title>Thermal pure states for systems with antiunitary symmetries and their tensor network representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugation symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic functions. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions Under Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecks in Occupational Transitions: A Data-driven Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of the light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We clarify the decaying process of such a domain wall that is caused by fluctuations of the order parameters. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. The decay process comprises two non-trivial stages. During the first stage, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in the 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in the 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior. Our theory provides a fundamental physical picture for the dynamics of pump-induced domain walls in ultrafast experiments.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent condensate formation in ultracold atoms with energy-dependent transport coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) formation in ultracold atoms is investigated in a nonlinear diffusion model. For constant transport coefficients, the model has been solved analytically. Here, we extend it to include energy-dependent transport coeffcients and numerically solve the nonlinear equation. Our results are compared with the earlier analytical model for constant transport coeffcients, and with recent deep-quench data for K-39 at various scattering lengths. Some non-physical predictions from the constant-coefficient model are resolved using energy-dependent drift and diffusion.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill recovery in chaotic and integrable unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03838</link>

Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

      <title>Optimal form of time-local non-Lindblad master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-local quantum master equations that describe open quantum systems beyond the limit of ultraweak system-bath coupling are often not of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) form. Prominent examples are the Redfield equation approximating general open quantum systems and the Hu-Paz-Zhang equation exactly describing a damped harmonic oscillator. Here, we show that not only the former, but also the latter can be brought to pseudo-Lindblad form, with a dissipator that resembles that of a GKSL equation, except for the fact that some of the terms have negative weights. Moreover, we systematically investigate transformations that leave the dissipator of pseudo-Lindblad equations unchanged, while changing the relative weight between its positive and negative terms. These can be used to minimize the weights of the negative terms, which is optimal both for the convergence of a recently developed quantum-trajectory unraveling of pseudo-Lindblad equations as well as for the truncation of the negative terms to obtain a GKSL equation.</description>
