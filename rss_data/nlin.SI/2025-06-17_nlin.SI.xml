      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Level structures on parahoric torsors and complete integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a smooth complex algebraic curve $X$ and a reduced effective divisor $D$ on $X$, we introduce a notion of $D$-level structure on parahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-torsors over $X$, for any connected complex reductive Lie group $G$. A moduli space of parahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-torsors equipped with a $D$-level structure is constructed and we identify a canonical moment map with respect to the action of a level group on this moduli space. This action extends to a Poisson action on the cotangent, thus inducing a Poisson structure on the moduli space of logahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-Higgs torsors on $X$. A study of the generic fibers of the parahoric Hitchin fibration of this moduli space identifies them as abelian torsors and introduces new algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian Hitchin systems in this parahoric setting. We show that this framework generalizes, among other, the integrable system of Beauville and recovers the classical Gaudin model in its simplest form, the space of periodic KP elliptic solitons and the elliptic Calogero--Moser system, thus demonstrating that the logahoric Hitchin integrable system unifies many integrable systems with regular singularities under a single geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Matrix models as tau functions of the UC hierarchy of integrable equations. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of matrix models such that their partition functions are tau functions of the universal character (UC) hierarchy. This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Homogeneous Integrable Systems: Free Parameters, Kovalevskaya Exponents, and the Painlev\'e Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-homogeneous integrable systems by analyzing their Laurent series solutions near movable singularities, motivated by patterns observed in Kovalevskaya exponents of four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations. We introduce a parameter space encoding the free coefficients in these expansions and study its deformation under a commuting quasi-homogeneous vector field.
  Within this framework, we derive lower indicial loci from the principal one and establish an arithmetic resonance condition on Kovalevskaya exponents that governs the emergence of fractional powers and the breakdown of the Painlev\'e property. Moreover, we construct a Frobenius manifold structure on the parameter space via the initial value map, which becomes conformal when all weights coincide.
  In the Hamiltonian context, we demonstrate that the induced flow on the parameter space preserves a symplectic form and yields a natural pairing of Kovalevskaya exponents. These findings unify analytic and geometric aspects of quasi-homogeneous integrable systems and offer new insights into their deformation theory and singularity structures. Our results provide a comprehensive framework applicable to the classification and analysis of Painlev\'e-type equations and related integrable models.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Higher-order Painlev\'{e} Equations/The $(3,4)$ String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a higher-order Painlev\'{e}-type equation, arising as a string equation of the $3^{rd}$ order reduction of the KP hierarchy. This equation appears at the multi-critical point of the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, and describes the Ising phase transition coupled to 2D gravity, cf. [1]. We characterize this equation in terms of the isomonodromic deformations of a particular rational connection on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. We also identify the (nonautonomous) Hamiltonian structure associated to this equation, and write a suitable $\tau$-differential for this system. This $\tau$-differential can be extended to the canonical coordinates of the associated Hamiltonian system, allowing us to verify Conjectures 1. and 2. of [2]. We also present a fairly general formula for the $\tau$-differential of a special class of resonant connections, which is somewhat simpler than that of [3].

      <title>Integrable deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $\sigma$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $\sigma$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense.</description>

      <title>Stability of 2-soliton solutions for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the stability of 2-soliton solutions on a nonzero constant background for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. By employing conserved quantities in terms of the momentum variable $m$, we show that the 2-soliton, when regarded as a solution to the initial-value problem for the modified Camassa-Holm equation, is nonlinearly stable to perturbations with respect to the momentum variable in the Sobolev space $H^2$.</description>
