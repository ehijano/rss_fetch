      <title>Monetary Incentives, Landowner Preferences: Estimating Cross-Elasticities in Farmland Conversion to Renewable Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of monetary factors on the conversion of farmland to renewable energy generation, specifically solar and wind, in the context of expanding U.S. energy production. We propose a new econometric method that accounts for the diverse circumstances of landowners, including their unordered alternative land use options, non-monetary benefits from farming, and the influence of local regulations. We demonstrate that identifying the cross elasticity of landowners' farming income in relation to the conversion of farmland to renewable energy requires an understanding of their preferences. By utilizing county legislation that we assume to be shaped by land-use preferences, we estimate the cross-elasticities of farming income. Our findings indicate that monetary incentives may only influence landowners' decisions in areas with potential for future residential development, underscoring the importance of considering both preferences and regulatory contexts.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance of Climate Vulnerability Indicators with Gradient Boosting across Five Global Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts are needed to identify and measure both communities' exposure to climate hazards and the social vulnerabilities that interact with these hazards, but the science of validating hazard vulnerability indicators is still in its infancy. Progress is needed to improve: 1) the selection of variables that are used as proxies to represent hazard vulnerability; 2) the applicability and scale for which these indicators are intended, including their transnational applicability. We administered an international urban survey in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Johannesburg, South Africa; London, United Kingdom; New York City, United States; and Seoul, South Korea in order to collect data on exposure to various types of extreme weather events, socioeconomic characteristics commonly used as proxies for vulnerability (i.e., income, education level, gender, and age), and additional characteristics not often included in existing composite indices (i.e., queer identity, disability identity, non-dominant primary language, and self-perceptions of both discrimination and vulnerability to flood risk). We then use feature importance analysis with gradient-boosted decision trees to measure the importance that these variables have in predicting exposure to various types of extreme weather events. Our results show that non-traditional variables were more relevant to self-reported exposure to extreme weather events than traditionally employed variables such as income or age. Furthermore, differences in variable relevance across different types of hazards and across urban contexts suggest that vulnerability indicators need to be fit to context and should not be used in a one-size-fits-all fashion.</description>

      <title>Building Interpretable Climate Emulators for Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for developing efficient and interpretable carbon-cycle emulators (CCEs) as part of climate emulators in Integrated Assessment Models, enabling economists to custom-build CCEs accurately calibrated to advanced climate science. We propose a generalized multi-reservoir linear box-model CCE that preserves key physical quantities and can be use-case tailored for specific use cases. Three CCEs are presented for illustration: the 3SR model (replicating DICE-2016), the 4PR model (including the land biosphere), and the 4PR-X model (accounting for dynamic land-use changes like deforestation that impact the reservoir's storage capacity). Evaluation of these models within the DICE framework shows that land-use changes in the 4PR-X model significantly impact atmospheric carbon and temperatures -- emphasizing the importance of using tailored climate emulators. By providing a transparent and flexible tool for policy analysis, our framework allows economists to assess the economic impacts of climate policies more accurately.</description>

      <title>Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional program evaluations typically rely on surveys to measure outcomes, certain economic outcomes such as living standards or environmental quality may be infeasible or costly to collect. As a result, recent empirical work estimates treatment effects using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), such mobile phone activity or satellite images, instead of ground-truth outcome measurements. Common practice predicts the economic outcome from the RSV, using an auxiliary sample of labeled RSVs, and then uses such predictions as the outcome in the experiment. We prove that this approach leads to biased estimates of treatment effects when the RSV is a post-outcome variable. We nonparametrically identify the treatment effect, using an assumption that reflects the logic of recent empirical research: the conditional distribution of the RSV remains stable across both samples, given the outcome and treatment. Our results do not require researchers to know or consistently estimate the relationship between the RSV, outcome, and treatment, which is typically mis-specified with unstructured data. We form a representation of the RSV for downstream causal inference by predicting the outcome and predicting the treatment, with better predictions leading to more precise causal estimates. We re-evaluate the efficacy of a large-scale public program in India, showing that the program's measured effects on local consumption and poverty can be replicated using satellite</description>

      <title>Econometrics and Formalism of Psychological Archetypes of Scientific Workers with Introverted Thinking Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chronological hierarchy and classification of psychological types of individuals are examined. The anomalous nature of psychological activity in individuals involved in scientific work is highlighted. Certain aspects of the introverted thinking type in scientific activities are analyzed. For the first time, psychological archetypes of scientists with pronounced introversion are postulated in the context of twelve hypotheses about the specifics of professional attributes of introverted scientific activities.
  A linear regression and Bayesian equation are proposed for quantitatively assessing the econometric degree of introversion in scientific employees, considering a wide range of characteristics inherent to introverts in scientific processing. Specifically, expressions for a comprehensive assessment of introversion in a linear model and the posterior probability of the econometric (scientometric) degree of introversion in a Bayesian model are formulated.
  The models are based on several econometric (scientometric) hypotheses regarding various aspects of professional activities of introverted scientists, such as a preference for solo publications, low social activity, narrow specialization, high research depth, and so forth. Empirical data and multiple linear regression methods can be used to calibrate the equations. The model can be applied to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological characteristics of scientific employees, which is particularly useful in ergonomics and the management of scientific teams and projects. The proposed method also provides scientists with pronounced introversion the opportunity to develop their careers, focusing on individual preferences and features.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effect Estimators as Weighted Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimators weighting observed outcomes to form an effect estimate have a long tradition. The corresponding outcome weights are utilized in established procedures, e.g. to check covariate balancing, to characterize target populations, or to detect and manage extreme weights. This paper provides a general framework to derive the functional form of such weights. It establishes when and how numerical equivalence between an original estimator representation as moment condition and a unique weighted representation can be obtained. The framework is applied to derive novel outcome weights for the leading cases of double machine learning and generalized random forests, with existing results recovered as special cases. The analysis highlights that implementation choices determine (i) the availability of outcome weights and (ii) their properties. Notably, standard implementations of partially linear regression based estimators - like causal forest - implicitly apply outcome weights that do not sum to (minus) one in the (un)treated group as usually considered desirable.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Covariate-Assisted Inference on Partially Identified Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many causal estimands are only partially identifiable since they depend on the unobservable joint distribution between potential outcomes. Stratification on pretreatment covariates can yield sharper bounds; however, unless the covariates are discrete with relatively small support, this approach typically requires binning covariates or estimating the conditional distributions of the potential outcomes given the covariates. Binning can result in substantial efficiency loss and become challenging to implement, even with a moderate number of covariates. Estimating conditional distributions, on the other hand, may yield invalid inference if the distributions are inaccurately estimated, such as when a misspecified model is used or when the covariates are high-dimensional. In this paper, we propose a unified and model-agnostic inferential approach for a wide class of partially identified estimands. Our method, based on duality theory for optimal transport problems, has four key properties. First, in randomized experiments, our approach can wrap around any estimates of the conditional distributions and provide uniformly valid inference, even if the initial estimates are arbitrarily inaccurate. A simple extension of our method to observational studies is doubly robust in the usual sense. Second, if nuisance parameters are estimated at semiparametric rates, our estimator is asymptotically unbiased for the sharp partial identification bound. Third, we can apply the multiplier bootstrap to select covariates and models without sacrificing validity, even if the true model is not selected. Finally, our method is computationally efficient. Overall, in three empirical applications, our method consistently reduces the width of estimated identified sets and confidence intervals without making additional structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public policies and medical interventions often involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where individuals receive a series of interventions over multiple stages. We study the statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's evolving history. We propose a doubly robust, classification-based approach to learning the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. This approach learns the optimal DTR through backward induction. At each step, it constructs an augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the policy value function and maximizes it to learn the optimal policy for the corresponding stage. We show that the resulting DTR can achieve an optimal convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for welfare regret under mild convergence conditions on estimators of the nuisance components.</description>
