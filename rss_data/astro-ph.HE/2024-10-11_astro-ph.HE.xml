      <title>Investigating the sightline of a highly scattered FRB through a filamentary structure in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are unique probes of extragalactic ionized baryonic structure as each signal, through its burst properties, holds information about the ionized matter it encounters along its sightline. FRB 20200723B is a burst with a scattering timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{400\,MHz} &gt;$1 second at 400 MHz and a dispersion measure of DM $\sim$ 244 pc cm$^{-3}$. Observed across the entire CHIME/FRB frequency band, it is the single-component burst with the largest scattering timescale yet observed by CHIME/FRB. The combination of its high scattering timescale and relatively low dispersion measure present an uncommon opportunity to use FRB 20200723B to explore the properties of the cosmic web it traversed. With an $\sim$arcminute-scale localization region, we find the most likely host galaxy is NGC 4602 (with PATH probability $P(O|x)=0.985$), which resides $\sim$30 Mpc away within a sheet filamentary structure on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. We place an upper limit on the average free electron density of this filamentary structure of $\langle n_e \rangle &lt; 4.6^{+9.6}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations. We investigate whether the source of scattering lies within the same galaxy as the FRB, or at a farther distance from an intervening structure along the line of sight. Comparing with Milky Way pulsar observations, we suggest the scattering may originate from within the host galaxy of FRB 20200723B.</description>

      <title>NICER and Swift/XRT monitoring of the 2023 outburst of Swift J1727.7-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray transient, Swift J1727.7-1613 was first detected on 24 August 2023 by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL. We investigated data from the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory taken between August and October 2023. We studied diagnostic diagrams, energy spectra, and short term variability. The observations cover the initial rise of the outburst in the hard state and the transition to the soft state. We focused on the evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) using power-density spectra and on the evolution of the spectral parameters. The overall evolution of Swift J1727.7-1613 is consistent with this source being a low-mass black hole X-ray binary. Based on the Lense-Thirring precession interpretation of type-C QPOs we obtained outer radii for the hot inner flow and found that the overall evolution of these radii agrees well with the evolution of the inner disc radii obtained from fits to the energy spectra. This result holds on all times scales tested in this study and supports the Lense-Thirring precession interpretation of type-C QPOs.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate Mass Black Hole Hidden Behind Thick Obscuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent models suggest approximately half of all accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$) are expected to undergo intense growth phases behind Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) veils of obscuring gas. However, despite being a viable source for the seeding of SMBHs, there are currently no examples known of a Compton-thick accreting intermediate mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{2}$ $-$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$). We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of IC 750 $-$ the only AGN to-date with a precise megamaser-based intermediate mass $&lt;$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find the equivalent width of neutral 6.4 keV Fe K$\alpha$ to be 1.9$^{+2.2}_{-1.0}$ keV via phenomenological modelling of the co-added 177 ks Chandra spectrum. Such large equivalent widths are seldom produced by processes other than fluorescence from dense obscuration. We fit three physically-motivated X-ray spectral models to infer a range of possible intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosity posteriors that encompass the systematic uncertainties associated with a choice of model. Despite a wide range of predicted intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosities between $\sim$ 10$^{41}$ and 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, all three models agree that IC 750 has a Compton-thick line-of-sight column density to $&gt;$ 99\% confidence. Compton-thick obscuration is well-documented to impinge substantial bias on the pursuit of SMBH AGN. Our results thus provide the first indication that Compton-thick obscuration should also be properly considered to uncover and understand the IMBH population in an unbiased manner.</description>

      <title>Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens: multiple features in the compact binary population correlate with $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parametrization, (ii) which features carry the most information about $H_0$, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on $H_0$ are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near $\sim$ 9 $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and a roll-off at masses above $\sim$ 46$\rm{M}_{\odot}$. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ consistently correlates with $H_0$ most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with $H_0$, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Probes of Supermassive Black Hole Spin Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the semi-analytic model Serotina, we investigate the cosmic spin evolution of supermassive black holes incorporating recent results from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of spin-down from relativistic jets. We compare several variations of our model with compiled black hole spin measurements derived from X-ray reflection spectroscopy, correcting for a bias arising from the spin-dependent radiative efficiency of accretion flows. We show that the observed spin distribution is in agreement with a model that includes jet-driven spin-down, a key mechanism that acts to modulate spins across cosmic time at both high and very low specific accretion rates. The data also clearly prefer models with coherent accretion over models in which accretion disks rapidly switch from prograde to retrograde. We further predict spin distributions accessible via spatially resolved event horizons by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), as well as gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), each of which offer unique and distinct windows into the population of spinning black holes. Jet-driven spin-down is most strongly imprinted on the abundance of very highly spinning objects in our model. In addition, we show that the spin distribution sampled by LISA events may contain a signature of the natal spin distribution of heavy seeds, but not of light seeds, offering additional discrimination between these seeding pathways. Spin distributions from these future observed samples can be used to constrain the detailed physical properties of the accretion flow on horizon scales around supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>The light burden of memory: constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray detection with the LOFAR radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) has successfully measured cosmic rays for over a decade now. With its dense core of antenna fields in the Netherlands, it is an ideal tool for studying the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $10^{16}$ eV to $10^{18.5}$ eV range. Every air shower is measured with a small particle detector array and hundreds of antennas, which sets LOFAR apart from other air shower arrays. We present our current achievements and progress in reconstruction, interpolation, and software development during the final phases of measurement of LOFAR 1.0, before the LOFAR array gets a significant upgrade, including also plans for the final data release and refined analyses.</description>

      <title>The radial distribution of radio emission from SN1993J: Magnetic field amplification due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [SHORTENED VERSION] Observations of radio emission from young core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) allow one to study the history of the pre-supernova stellar wind, trace the density structure of the ejected material, and probe the magnetohydrodynamics that describe the interaction between the two, as the forward shock expands into the circumstellar medium. The radio shell of supernova SN1993J has been observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for ~20 years, giving one of the most complete pictures of the evolution of a CCSN shock. However, different results about the expansion curve and properties of the radio-emitting structure have been reported by different authors, likely due to systematics in the data calibration and/or model assumptions made by each team. We aim to perform an analysis of the complete set of VLBI observations of SN1993J that accounts for different instrumental and source-intrinsic effects, by exploring the posterior probability distribution of a complete data model, using Markov chains. Our model accounts for antenna calibration effects, as well as different kinds of radio-emission structures for the supernova. The posterior parameter distributions strongly favor a spherical shell-like radio structure with a nonuniform radial intensity profile, with a broad brightness distribution that peaks close to or just above the region where the contact discontinuity is expected to be located. There is clear evidence of a relative widening of the shell width beyond day 2600-3300 after the explosion, due to an increased deceleration of the inner shell boundary. These results suggest a scenario in which the magnetic field is amplified mainly by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which emanates from the contact discontinuity. Furthermore, the reverse shock enters a region of the ejecta at around 3000 days, where the density distribution is substantially flatter.</description>

      <title>Jets, accretion and spin in supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical model suggests that relativistic jets of AGN rely on the black hole spin and/or accretion. We study the relationship between jet, accretion, and spin using supermassive black hole samples with reliable spin of black holes. Our results are as follows: (1) There is a weak correlation between radio luminosity and the spin of black hole for our sample, which may imply that the jet of the supermassive black hole in our sample depends on the other physical parameters besides black hole spins, such as accretion disk luminosity. (2) The jet power of a supermassive black hole can be explained by the hybrid model with magnetic field of corona. (3) There is a significant correlation between radio-loudness and black hole spin for our sample. These sources with high radio-loudness tend to have high black hole spins. These results provide observational evidence that the black hole spin may explain the bimodal phenomena of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM light curves evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the light curve characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EOSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ seconds and the peak luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg}/s$ by using a reasonable set of parameters such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ Gauss, the quadrupole to dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by Swift/XRT, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via MCMC fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multi-messenger detections can be used to understand the nature of GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

      <title>Candidate neutrino-emitting blazars sharing physical properties with TXS 0506+056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The interest in blazars as candidate neutrino emitters grew after the 3{\sigma} evidence for a joint photon-neutrino emission from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017. Blazars are a class of extragalactic sources with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, showing a broadband emission explained in terms of leptonic and hadronic process, with the latter relevant for proton acceleration and neutrino production. Several models have been developed to explain the multi-messenger emission from TXS 0506+056, but the details of the neutrino production and the nature of the source are not yet fully understood. Aims. In this work we investigate sources with observational features as TXS 0506+056, aiming at a better understanding of their nature as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lac Objects (BL Lacs) and their potential neutrino production. Methods. We select candidate neutrino-emitting blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR2 catalog by constraining a number of key parameters in specific ranges centered on the values measured for TXS 0506+056. We analyze the efficiency of the accretion mechanism and model their broadband spectral energy distribution in terms of lepto-hadronic emission, gaining information on their potential neutrino flux and detectability prospects at TeV energies. Results. Our study shows the selected sources to have a high energy emission dominated by leptonic processes, and part of them also shows a high accretion rate, features typical of FSRQs. Moreover, the very high energy and neutrino fluxes appear to be not detectable by the current and future instruments if the source is in an average emission state. Our results thus suggest some of the candidates to have an efficient accretion and could potentially be masquerading BL Lacs. Lastly, TXS 0506+056 seems to have a more uncertain situation for which no strong conclusions can be drawn on its nature.</description>

      <title>Effect of near-earth thunderstorm electric field on the flux of cosmic ray air showers in LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is located at Haizi Mountain, Daocheng, Sichuan province, China. Due to its high-altitude location with frequent thunderstorm activities, the LHAASO is suited for studying the effects of near-earth thunderstorm electric fields on cosmic ray air showers. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations are performed with CORSIKA and G4KM2A to analyze the flux variations of cosmic ray air showers detected by the kilometer-square array of LHAASO (LHAASO-KM2A) during thunderstorms. The strength, polarity, and layer thickness of atmospheric electric field (AEF) during thunderstorm are found to be associated with the shower rate variations. The flux of shower events satisfying trigger conditions of the KM2A increases with field intensity, particularly within negative fields, and the enhanced amplitude is more than 5% in -600 V/cm and 12% in -1000 V/cm, whereas it increases by only 1% and 7% in equivalent positive fields, respectively. While in positive fields ranging from 0 to 400 V/cm, the shower rate decreases with smaller amplitudes. Furthermore, the shower rate increases dramatically with the AEF layer thickness until a certain value, above which the variation trend slows down. The dependence of the trigger rate variation on the primary zenith angle has also been revealed, increasing in lower zenith angle ranges and showing opposite behaviors in higher ones. Additionally, we study that the relationship between the trigger rate variations and the primary energies, and find the enhanced amplitude of the shower rate decreases with increasing primary energy. Simultaneously, the shower events with lower primary energy show a significant increase, whereas events with higher primary energy are hardly affected during thunderstorms. Our simulations offer insights into the variation of the trigger rate detected by LHAASO-KM2A during thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>Incidence of afterglow plateaus in GRBs associated with binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most surprising Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) features discovered with the Swift-X ray telescope (XRT) is a plateau phase in the early X-ray afterglow lightcurves. These plateaus are observed in the majority of long GRBs, while their incidence in short GRBs is still uncertain due to their fainter X-ray afterglow luminosity with respect to long GRBs. An accurate estimate of the fraction of short GRBs with plateaus is of utmost relevance given the implications on the jet structure and possibly on the nature of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant. This work presents the results of an extensive data analysis of the largest and most up-to-date sample of short GRBs observed with the XRT, and for which the redshift has been measured. We found a plateau incidence of 18-37% in short GRBs, a fraction significantly lower than the one measured in long GRBs (&gt;50%). Although still debated, the plateau phase could be explained as energy injection from the spin-down power of a newly born magnetized neutron star (magnetar). We show that this scenario can nicely reproduce the observed short GRB plateaus, while at the same time providing a natural explanation for the different plateau fractions between short and long GRBs. In particular, our findings may imply that only a minority of BNS mergers generating short GRBs leave behind a stable neutron star (NS) or a long-lived NS, long enough to form a plateau, constraining the maximum NS mass to be in the range $\sim$ 2.3 - 2.35 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Parkes Radio and NuSTAR X-ray Observations of the Composite Supernova Remnant B0453-685 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray emission is observed coincident in position to the evolved, composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453-685. Prior multi-wavelength investigations of the region indicate that the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the SNR is the most likely origin for the observed gamma-rays, with a possible pulsar contribution that becomes significant at energies below E ~ 5GeV. Constraints on the PWN hard X-ray spectrum are important for the most accurate broadband representation of PWN emission and determining the presence of a gamma-ray pulsar component. The results of Parkes radio and NuSTAR X-ray observations are presented on PWN B0453-685. We perform a search for the central pulsar in the new Parkes radio data, finding an upper limit of 12uJy. A pulsation search in the new NuSTAR observation additionally provides a 3sigma upper-limit on the hard X-ray pulsed fraction of 56%. The PWN is best characterized with a photon index Gamma_X = 1.91 +\- 0.20 in the 3-78keV NuSTAR data and the results are incorporated into existing broadband models. Lastly, we characterize a serendipitous source detected by Chandra and NuSTAR that is considered a new high mass X-ray binary candidate.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of spin and other properties of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries: implications for millisecond X-ray pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutron star (NS) accreting matter from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system can spin up to become a millisecond pulsar (MSP). Properties of many such MSP systems are known, which is excellent for probing fundamental aspects of NS physics when modelled using the theoretical computation of NS LMXB evolution. Here, we systematically compute the long-term evolution of NS, binary and companion parameters for NS LMXBs using the stellar evolution code MESA. We consider the baryonic to gravitational mass conversion to calculate the NS mass evolution and show its cruciality for the realistic computation of some parameters. With computations using many combinations of parameter values, we find the general nature of the complex NS spin frequency ($\nu$) evolution, which depends on various parameters, including accretion rate, fractional mass loss from the system, and companion star magnetic braking. Further, we utilize our results to precisely match some main observed parameters, such as $\nu$, orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$), etc., of four accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs). By providing the $\nu$, $P_{\rm orb}$ and the companion mass spaces for NS LMXB evolution, we indicate the distribution and plausible evolution of a few other AMXPs. We also discuss the current challenges in explaining the parameters of AMXP sources with brown dwarf companions and indicate the importance of modelling the transient accretion in LMXBs as a possible solution.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of SN 2023ixf reveals both circumstellar material and helium core to be aspherical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of polarization $P_r = 0.88\pm 0.06 \% $ seen during this phase indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level ($0.35\%$) during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($P_r =0.65 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an "inverse P Cygn" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We extend the concept of quadrupolar correlations to pairs of general gravitational wave detectors, classified by their antenna responses. This study involves space-based missions such as the laser interferometers LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, along with atom interferometers like AEDGE/MAGIS. We calculate modulations in their correlations due to orbital motions and relative orientations, which are characteristic markers for identifying the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>The effect of mass loss in models of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate and mechanism of mass loss of red supergiants (RSGs) remain poorly understood, especially at low metallicities. Motivated by the new empirical prescription by Yang et al. 2023, based on the largest and most complete sample in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we investigate the impact of different popular and recent RSG mass-loss prescriptions that span a range of RSG mass-loss rates on the evolution and observable properties of single massive stars. Our results show that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and shorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a steeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN progenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent with all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in deriving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et al. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population of luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing the commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions overestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates for luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the observed RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated Humphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant progenitors not detected in nearby supernovae. We also estimate that binary interactions tend to slightly increase the formation of luminous RSGs due to mass accretion or merging. Our study examines the impact of RSG mass loss during the late stages of massive stars, highlighting the significance of using comprehensive observational data, exploring the uncertainties involved, and considering the effects of binary-induced or episodic mass loss.</description>

      <title>The NuSTAR Local AGN $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution Survey (NuLANDS) I: Towards a Truly Representative Column Density Distribution in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-selected samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provide one of the cleanest views of supermassive black hole accretion, but are biased against objects obscured by Compton-thick gas column densities of $N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. To tackle this issue, we present the NuSTAR Local AGN $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution Survey (NuLANDS)$-$a legacy sample of 122 nearby ($z$ $&lt;$ 0.044) AGN primarily selected to have warm infrared colors from IRAS between 25$-$60 $\mu$m. We show that optically classified type 1 and 2 AGN in NuLANDS are indistinguishable in terms of optical [OIII] line flux and mid-to-far infrared AGN continuum bolometric indicators, as expected from an isotropically selected AGN sample, while type 2 AGN are deficient in terms of their observed hard X-ray flux. By testing many X-ray spectroscopic models, we show the measured line-of-sight column density varies on average by $\sim$ 1.4 orders of magnitude depending on the obscurer geometry. To circumvent such issues we propagate the uncertainties per source into the parent column density distribution, finding a directly measured Compton-thick fraction of 35 $\pm$ 9%. By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe narrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale nuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies an even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests for additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong effects on the measured column-density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds potential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and next-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an isotropic manner.</description>

      <title>First Very Long Baseline Interferometry Detections at 870{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) detections at 870$\mu$m wavelength (345$\,$GHz frequency) are reported, achieving the highest diffraction-limited angular resolution yet obtained from the surface of the Earth, and the highest-frequency example of the VLBI technique to date. These include strong detections for multiple sources observed on inter-continental baselines between telescopes in Chile, Hawaii, and Spain, obtained during observations in October 2018. The longest-baseline detections approach 11$\,$G$\lambda$ corresponding to an angular resolution, or fringe spacing, of 19$\mu$as. The Allan deviation of the visibility phase at 870$\mu$m is comparable to that at 1.3$\,$mm on the relevant integration time scales between 2 and 100$\,$s. The detections confirm that the sensitivity and signal chain stability of stations in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array are suitable for VLBI observations at 870$\mu$m. Operation at this short wavelength, combined with anticipated enhancements of the EHT, will lead to a unique high angular resolution instrument for black hole studies, capable of resolving the event horizons of supermassive black holes in both space and time.</description>

      <title>PSF Calibration of DAMPE for gamma-ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is dedicated to exploring critical scientific domains including the indirect detection of dark matter, cosmic ray physics, and gamma ray astronomy. This study introduces a novel method for calibrating the Point Spread Function (PSF) of DAMPE, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of gamma-ray observations. By leveraging data from regions near pulsars and bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), we have refined the PSF calibration process, resulting in an improved angular resolution that closely matches our observational data. This advancement significantly boosts the precision of gamma-ray detection by DAMPE, thereby contributing to its mission objectives in dark matter detection and gamma ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>From spherical stars to disk-like structures: 3D common-envelope evolution of massive binaries beyond inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection (${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism: The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ($2.97\,M_\odot$) until core collapse ($6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Searching for the mHz variability in the TESS observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AIMS: We investigated fast optical variability of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by TESS satellite. We searched for break frequencies (f_b) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS). The goal is to study whether these systems in almost permanent high optical state exhibit preferred f_b around 1 mHz. METHODS: We selected non-interrupted light curve portions with duration of 5 and 10 days. We divided these portions into ten equally long light curve subsamples and calculated mean PDS. We searched for f_b in frequency interval from log(f/Hz) = -3.5 to -2.4. We defined as positive detection when the f_b was present in at least 50% of the light curve portions with a predefined minimum number of detections. RESULTS: We measured f_b in 15 nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz with a maximum of the distribution between log(f/Hz) = -2.95 and -2.84. The confidence that this maximum is not a random feature of a uniform distribution is at least 96%. This is considerably improved since previous value of 69%. We discuss the origin of these f_b in the context of sandwich model where central hot X-ray corona surrounds central optically thick disc. This scenario could be supported by correlation between white dwarf mass and f_b; the larger the mass, the lower the frequency. We see such tendency in the measured data, however the data are too scattered and based on low number of measurements. Finally, it appears that systems with detected f_b have lower inclination than 60-75 degrees. In higher inclination binaries the central disc is not seen and the PDS is dominated by red noise. This also supports the inner disc regions as source of the observed f_b.</description>

      <title>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei III. Five years monitoring of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) within M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, is responsible for one of the closest kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet to Earth. We unearthed unpublished M87 polarization maps taken with the Faint Object Camera (FOC) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), obtained between 1995 and 1999. At a rate of one observation per year, we can follow the evolution of the polarized flux knots in the jet. We can thus constrain the time scale of variation of the magnetic field up to a spatial resolution of one tenth of an arcsecond (11.5 pc). After coherently reducing the five observations using the same methodology presented in the first paper of this series, the analysis of polarized maps from POS 1 (base of the jet) and POS 3 (end of the jet) reveals significant temporal and spatial dynamics in the jet's magnetic fields morphology. Despite minimal changes in overall intensity structure, notable fluctuations in polarization degrees and angles are detected across various knots and inter-knot regions. In addition, the emission and polarization characteristics of M87's jet differ significantly between POS1 and POS3. POS1 shows a more collimated jet with strong variability in polarization, while POS3 reveals a thicker structure, a quasi-absence of variability and complex magnetic field interactions. This suggests that the jet may have co-axial structures with distinct kinetic properties. Theoretical models like the jet-in-jet scenario, featuring double helical magnetic flux ropes, help explain these observations, indicating a strong density contrast and higher speeds in the inner jet.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results also have difference with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses, shows the reason of different GW power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Frozen and $\beta$-equilibrated $f$ and $p$ modes of cold neutron stars: nuclear metamodel predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the chemical re-equilibration timescale is sufficiently long, the normal and quasi-normal mode frequencies of neutron stars should be calculated in the idealized limit that the internal composition of each fluid element is fixed over the oscillation period. However, many studies rely on a barotropic equation of state, which implicitly overlooks potential out-of-$\beta$-equilibrium effects. To investigate possible biases arising from this assumption, we calculate the non-radial fundamental ($f$) and first pressure ($p_1$) modes for a wide range of neutron star structures, each governed by different nucleonic equations of state. This ensemble is generated using the metamodel technique, a phenomenological framework that incorporates constraints from experimental nuclear physics and chiral effective field theory. The metamodel also provides the internal composition of $\beta$-equilibrated $npe\mu$ matter, allowing us to calculate oscillation modes beyond those supported by a purely barotropic fluid. Thus, we systematically assess the impact of assuming a barotropic equation of state across various equations of state and provide a distribution of expected $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies that may be detectable by next-generation gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of several explanations of the strong X-ray polarization of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of the X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 in the high soft state revealed high linear polarization degrees (PDs) rising from 6% at 2 keV to 10% at 8 keV. We discuss in this letter three different mechanisms that impact the polarization of the observed X-rays: the reflection of gravitationally lensed emission by the accretion disk, reprocessing of the emission in outflowing plasma, and electron and ion anisotropies in the accretion disk atmosphere. We conducted detailed raytracing studies to evaluate the impact of the reflection of strongly gravitationally lensed emission on the PDs. Although the reflected emission can produce high PDs in the high-energy tail of the thermal emission component, we do not find models that describe the PDs and are consistent with independent estimates of the source distance. We discuss the energetics of another proposed mechanism: the emission or scattering of the X-rays in mildly relativistically moving plasma outflows. We argue that these models are disfavored as they require large mechanical luminosities on the order of, or even exceeding the Eddington Luminosity. We investigated the impact of electron and ion anisotropies, but find that their impact on the observed PDs are likely negligible. We conclude with a discussion of all three effects and avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Quasithermal GeV neutrinos from neutron-loaded magnetized outflows in core-collapse supernovae: spectra and light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) created in core-collapse supernovae can drive relativistic magnetized winds. Ions and neutrons can be co-accelerated while they remain coupled through elastic collisions. We investigate the nucleosynthesis and subsequent nuclear disintegration, and find that relativistic neutrons can be generated in such magnetized winds. Upon eventual decoupling, resulting inelastic collisions with ejecta lead to pion production, resulting in $0.1-10\,{\rm GeV}$ neutrinos. Following this scenario presented in Murase, Dasgupta \&amp; Thompson, Phys. Rev. D, 89, 043012 (2014), we numerically calculate the spectra and light curves of quasithermal neutrino emission. In the event of a Galactic supernova, $\sim 10-1000$ neutrino events could be detected with Hyper-Kamiokande, KM3Net-ORCA and IceCube-Upgrade for PNSs with surface magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\sim 10^{13-15}\,{\rm G}$ and initial spin period $P_i \sim 1-30\,{\rm ms}$. Successful detection will enable us to study supernovae as multienergy neutrino sources and may provide clues to the roles of PNSs in diverse classes of transients.</description>

      <title>The Detection Prospect of the Counter Jet Radiation in the Late Afterglow of GRB 170817A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central engine of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) is widely believed to launch a pair of oppositely moving jets, i.e. the forward jet moving towards us and the counter jet regressing away. The forward jet generates the radiation typically observed in GRBs, while the counter jet has not been detected yet due to its dimness. GRB 170817A, a short burst associated with a binary neutron star merger event, is a nearby event ($z=0.0097$) with an off-axis structured energetic forward jet and hence probably the most suitable target for searching the counter jet radiation. Assuming the same properties for the forward and counter jet components as well as the shock parameters, the fit to the multi-wavelength afterglow emission of GRB 170817A suggests a peak time $\sim {\rm quite~a~few}\times 10^{3}$ day of the counter jet radiation, but the detection prospect of this new component is not promising. Anyhow, if the shock parameters ($\epsilon_{\rm e}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm B}$) of the counter jet component are (a few times) higher than that of the forward shock e.g., the posterior results of the magnetic energy fraction of the forward shock and the counter jet are $\log_{10}\epsilon_{\rm B}=-4.23^{+1.42}_{-0.69}$ and $\log_{10}\epsilon_{\rm B, cj}=-3.65^{+3.06}_{-2.11}$, respectively), as still allowed by the current data, the counter jet afterglow emission will be enhanced and hence may be detected. A few hour exposure by JWST in F356W band will stringently test such a scenario.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation tracking the magnetosphere of a collapsing magnetar. The collapse is expected for massive rotating magnetars formed in merger events, and may occur many hours after the merger. Our simulation suggests a novel mechanism for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) which is uncollimated and forms a delayed high-energy counterpart of the merger gravitational waves. The simulation shows that the collapse launches an outgoing magnetospheric shock, and a hot magnetized outflow forms behind the shock. The outflow is baryon-free and uncollimated, and its power peaks on a millisecond timescale. Then, the outflow becomes modulated by the ring-down of the nascent black hole, imprinting its kilohertz quasi-normal modes on the GRB tail.</description>

      <title>Varying activity and the burst properties of FRB 20240114A probed with GMRT down to 300 MHz</title>

Abstract: Repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) can exhibit a wide range of burst repetition rates, from none to hundreds of bursts per hour. Here, we report the detection and characteristics of 60 bursts from the recently discovered FRB 20240114A, observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency ranges 300-500MHz and 550-750 MHz. The majority of the bursts show narrow emission bandwidth with $\Delta\nu/\nu \sim$ 10\%. All of the bursts we detect are faint ($&lt;$10 Jy ms) and thus probe the lower end of the energy distribution. We determine the rate function for FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz, and downward drift rates at 400 and 650 MHz, and discuss our measurements in the context of the repeating FRB population. We observe sudden variations in the burst activity of FRB 20240114A over time. From our data as well as the publicly available information on other observations of FRB 20240114A so far, there is an indication that FRB 20240114A potentially exhibits chromaticity in its burst activity. While the burst properties of FRB 20240114A are similar to other repeating FRBs, the frequency-dependent activity, if established, could provide crucial clues to the origin of repeating FRBs. We also place the most stringent 5$\sigma$ upper limits of 600 $\mu$Jy and 89 $\mu$Jy on any persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz and 650 MHz, respectively, and compare these with the luminosity of the known PRSs associated with FRB121102A and FRB190520B.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a hypothesis proposed in previous research relating neutron star (NS) mass and its dark matter (DM) accumulation. As DM accumulates, NS mass decreases, predicting lower NS masses toward the Galactic center. Due to limited NSs data near the galactic center, we examine NSs located within DM clumps. Using the CLUMPY code simulations, we determine the DM clumps distribution, with masses from 10 to $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and scales from $10^{-3}$ to 10 kpc. These clumps' DM exhibit a peak at the center, tapering toward the outskirts, resembling our Galaxy's DM distribution.
  We analyse these DM clumps' NS mass variations, considering diverse DM particle masses and galaxy types. We find relatively stable NS mass within 0.01 to 5 kpc from the clump center. This stability supports the initial hypothesis, particularly for NSs located beyond 0.01 kpc from the clump center, where NS mass reaches a plateau around 0.1 kpc. Nevertheless, NS mass near the clump's periphery reveals spatial dependence: NS position within DM clumps influences its mass in Milky Way-type galaxies. Moreover, this dependence varies with the DM model considered.
  In summary, our study investigates the proposed link between NS mass and DM accumulation by examining NSs within DM clumps. While NS mass remains stable at certain distances from the clump center, spatial dependencies arise near the clump's outer regions, contingent on the specific DM model.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Subdwarf B Stars</title>

Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alters their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\,M_\odot$) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\,M_\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes $\sim \! 0.15\;\mathrm{days}$. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>

Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>
