      <title>Portable-CELLxGENE: standalone executables of CELLxGENE for easy installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Biologists who want to analyse their single-cell transcriptomics dataset must install and use specialist software via the command line. This is often impractical for non-bioinformaticians. Whilst CELLxGENE provides an intuitive graphical interface to facilitate analysis outside the command line, its server-side installation and execution remain complex. A version that is easier to install and run would allow non-bioinformaticians to take advantage of this valuable tool without needing to use the command line.
  Results: Portable-CELLxGENE is a standalone distribution of CELLxGENE that can be installed via a graphical interface. It contains an easy-to-use extension of the CELLxGENE-gateway Python package to allow the analysis of multiple datasets.
  Availability and implementation: Standalone executables compiled for Windows and MacOS are available at github.com/george-hall-ucl/portable-cellxgene. Source code is also available at the same address. Licensed under the GNU GPL v3.</description>

      <title>From Glucose Patterns to Health Outcomes: A Generalizable Foundation Model for Continuous Glucose Monitor Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning enabled novel medical AI models, known as foundation models (FMs) that offer great potential for characterizing health from diverse biomedical data. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods. Overall, we show that GluFormer accurately predicts health outcomes which generalize across different populations metabolic conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards an Accessible, Noninvasive Micronutrient Status Assessment Method: A Comprehensive Review of Existing Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nutrients are critical to the functioning of the human body and their imbalance can result in detrimental health concerns. The majority of nutritional literature focuses on macronutrients, often ignoring the more critical nuances of micronutrient balance, which require more precise regulation. Currently, micronutrient status is routinely assessed via complex methods that are arduous for both the patient and the clinician. To address the global burden of micronutrient malnutrition, innovations in assessment must be accessible and noninvasive. In support of this task, this article synthesizes useful background information on micronutrients themselves, reviews the state of biofluid and physiological analyses for their assessment, and presents actionable opportunities to push the field forward. By taking a unique, clinical perspective that is absent from technological research on the topic, we find that the state of the art suffers from limited clinical relevance, a lack of overlap between biofluid and physiological approaches, and highly invasive and inaccessible solutions. Future work has the opportunity to maximize the impact of a novel assessment method by incorporating clinical relevance, the holistic nature of micronutrition, and prioritizing accessible and noninvasive systems.</description>

      <title>Bioimpedance a Diagnostic Tool for Tobacco Induced Oral Lesions: a Mixed Model cross-sectional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has recently developed as a novel diagnostic device for screening and evaluating cervical dysplasia, prostate cancer, breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma. The current study aimed to validate and evaluate bioimpedance as a diagnostic tool for tobacco-induced oral lesions. Methodology: The study comprised 50 OSCC and OPMD tissue specimens for in-vitro study and 320 subjects for in vivo study. Bioimpedance device prepared and calibrated. EIS measurements were done for the habit and control groups and were compared. Results: The impedance value in the control group was significantly higher compared to the OPMD and OSCC groups. Diagnosis based on BIS measurements has a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 86.7%. Conclusion: Bioimpedance device can help in decision-making for differentiating OPMD and OSCC cases and their management, especially in primary healthcare settings.

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Pepper Mild Mottle Virus Biomarker in Wastewater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the start of the coronavirus-19 pandemic, the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for disease surveillance has increased throughout the world. Because wastewater measurements are affected by external factors, processing WBE data typically includes a normalization step in order to adjust wastewater measurements (e.g. viral RNA concentrations) to account for variation due to dynamic population changes, sewer travel effects, or laboratory methods. Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant RNA virus abundant in human feces and wastewater, has been used as a fecal contamination indicator and has been used to normalize wastewater measurements extensively. However, there has been little work to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of PMMoV in wastewater, which may influence the effectiveness of PMMoV for adjusting or normalizing WBE measurements. Here, we investigate its variability across space and time using data collected over a two-year period from sewage treatment plants across the United States. We find that most variation in PMMoV measurements can be attributed to longitude and latitude followed by site-specific variables. Further research into cross-geographical and -temporal comparability of PMMoV-normalized pathogen concentrations would strengthen the utility of PMMoV in WBE.</description>

      <title>Prosody of speech production in latent post-stroke aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores prosodic production in latent aphasia, a mild form of aphasia associated with left-hemisphere brain damage (e.g. stroke). Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.</description>
