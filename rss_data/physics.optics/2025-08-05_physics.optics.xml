      <title>Identifying and anticipating the threshold bifurcation of a complex laser with permutation entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permutation entropy (PE) is a statistical indicator that allows to quantify the complexity of a signal. Here we show that it is able to {identify and anticipate} the threshold bifurcation of a complex laser, where thousands of modes compete for gain at the onset of lasing. In our experimental setup, the cavity roundtrip time is several orders of magnitude longer than the temporal resolution of the detection system, which enables a high statistical sampling of the intensity dynamics per roundtrip. We show that the permutation entropy experiences a clear decrease far below the threshold and reaches a sharp minimum at the threshold bifurcation point, which reveals an abrupt increase of the temporal correlations. The evolution of the entropy is compared with standard quantifiers of approaching bifurcations. While lag-1 autocorrelation gradually grows as the threshold is approached, PE shows a steep decrease that captures the emergence of nonlinear correlations and thus, it allows a clearer identification of the threshold.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved infrared photothermal imaging: From transient observations towards the steady-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared photothermal microscopy is a highly promising imaging technique that enables spatially resolved vibrational fingerprinting. The combination of infrared induced heating with optical readout at visible wavelengths provides excellent spatial resolution while retaining the spectral observations of conventional infrared imaging. Most current implementations rely on long-duration illumination periods, to ensure sufficient heating and hence large signals. However, undesirable processes such as heat-diffusion degrade spatial resolution and the interplay between heat-induced refractive index changes and sample expansion adds additional uncertainties. Fundamentally, these issues stem from the difficulties associated with separating non-equilibrium and photoacoustic contributions from purely thermal signals. Highly time-resolved observations hold great promise for addressing these issues and are imperative for enabling future imaging modalities in this exciting temporal window. Here, we provide this much needed insight by employing widefield phototransient holography to phase-resolve optical responses from pico- to tens of nanoseconds following vibrational overtone excitation. We observe rapid transient-induced phase shifts, followed by heat-induced coherent expansion and thermalisation dynamics. Our observations provide a direct link between the photoacoustic and photothermal realms, thus not only offering much-needed insight for rationally optimising these exciting technologies but also avenues towards future all-optical stiffness and super-resolution imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Photonic Membranes Achieving Uniform and Strong Enhancement of Photoluminescence and Second-Harmonic Generation in Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01118v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong excitonic responses, direct bandgaps, and remarkable nonlinear optical properties, making them highly attractive for integrated photonic, optoelectronic, and quantum applications. Here, we present a large area freestanding membrane photonic platform that achieves exceptional enhancement of light matter interactions in monolayer WSe2 via quasi bound states in the continuum. The freestanding architecture effectively suppresses radiative losses and supports high Q optical resonances, leading to enhanced light matter interactions. This results in significant photoluminescence emission and second harmonic generation enhancement factors of 1158 and 378, respectively, with spatial uniformity sustained across a 450 times 450 um2 area. This uniform SHG enhancement further enables polarization resolved mapping of crystal orientation and grain boundaries, offering a practical method for large area structural characterization of 2D materials. Moreover, femtosecond pumped SHG spectra reveal multiple narrowband peaks originating from distinct quasi BIC modes providing direct spectral evidence of resonantly enhanced nonlinear coupling. The combined attributes of strong optical enhancement, spectral selectivity, and wafer scale compatibility establish this platform as a scalable interface for 2D semiconductor integration in next generation optoelectronic, nonlinear, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>The essential spectrum of periodically stationary pulses in lumped models of short-pulse fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a wide range of lumped laser models.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Phase Noise on M-ary QAM THz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz technology is positioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless links due to the extensive untapped bandwidth and inherent compatibility with silicon photonics. Here, the phase noise of THz sources is modeled to characterized its impacts on a QAM-based wireless communication system. Particularly, common and instantaneous phase errors are unveiled and presented via constellation diagrams. In addition, tolerance of phase noise under different M-ary modulation formats is explored. Meanwhile, a linear correlation between instantaneous component and EVM is revealed to define the error-free boundary, where microcomb-driven scheme is highlighted as a highly promising candidate for error-resilient THz links under advanced M-QAM formats. The results intuitively illustrate the impacts of phase noise and offer practical insights for refining technical details on physical-layer protocols.</description>

      <title>Three-period evolution in a photonic Floquet extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic driving can induce the emergence of topological pi modes, and their superposition with zero modes leads to two-period dynamics. Introducing long-range couplings enables the realization of larger topological winding numbers, which correspond to multiple pairs of degenerate edge states under open boundary conditions. In this work, we construct a Floquet extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model by introducing a two-step periodic driving and next-nearest-neighbor coupling into the static SSH chain simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify anomalous edge states with quasienergies -+pi/3T and -+2pi/3T. In order to reveal the dynamical features of these anomalous edge states, we elaborately adjust the optical parameters and ultimately achieve a successful mapping of the model onto a photonic waveguide array. Subsequently, through numerical simulation of the wave equation, we observe the unique behavior of three-period evolution. Our work may serve as a reference for realizing period-multiplied dynamics, and the anomalous edge states discussed here might also find applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Sub 10 nm Nanochannels Enable Directional Quasi Ballistic Exciton Transport over 5 {\mu}m at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale potential wells provide a powerful means to engineer energy landscapes in low dimensional materials, enabling control over quantum states, carrier dynamics, and optoelectronic responses. Such confinement governs phenomena including charge localization, transport anisotropy, band structure modulation, and light matter interaction strength. However, realizing clean and well defined nanostructures remains technically challenging, as fabrication techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) milling and electron beam lithography frequently introduce structural disorder, residual contamination, or detrimental interactions with the underlying substrate. Here, we develop a femtosecond laser direct writing technique to create sub 10 nm wide dielectric nanochannels with smooth, continuous boundaries on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, without using resists or chemical etchants. As a demonstration, these nanochannels are employed to define programmable dielectric landscapes in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), forming excitonic energy funnels that suppress scattering and significantly extend the exciton transport distance. Transport is reshaped from isotropic diffusion with submicron range to directional super diffusion exhibiting quasi ballistic transport exceeding 5 um, more than 20 times longer than in unpatterned systems. The smooth dielectric boundaries further enable precise control over exciton trajectories, allowing for programmable transport pathways. This dry, scalable, and substrate compatible approach offers a robust platform for exciton engineering and integrated quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Biosensors on Chip: A Review from Electronic and Photonic Integrated Circuits to Future Integrated Quantum Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum biosensors offer a promising route to overcome the sensitivity and specificity limitations of conventional biosensing technologies. Their ability to detect biochemical signals at extremely low concentrations makes them strong candidates for next-generation sensing systems. This paper reviews the current state of quantum biosensors and dis-cusses their future implementation in chip-scale platforms that combine microelectronic and photonic technologies. It covers key quantum biosensing approaches including quantum dots, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. This paper also considers their po-tential compatibility with electronic integrated circuits (EICs), photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and integrated quantum photonic (IQP) systems for future biosensing applications. To our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically connect quantum biosensing technologies with the development of microelectronic and photonic chip-based devices. The goal is to clarify the technological trajectory toward compact, scalable, and high-performance quantum biosensing systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Lithium Niobate Nonlinear Photonic Circuits for Low-Crosstalk and Broadband All Optical Wavelength Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All optical wavelength converters (AOWCs) that can effectively and flexibly switch optical signals between different wavelength channels are essential elements in future optical fiber communications and quantum information systems. A promising strategy for achieving high-performance AOWCs is to leverage strong three-wave mixing processes in second-order nonlinear nanophotonic devices, specifically thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) waveguides. By exploiting the advantages of sub-wavelength light confinement and dispersion engineering compared with their bulk counterparts, TF-PPLN waveguides provide a viable route for realizing highly efficient and broadband wavelength conversion. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely on a single TF-PPLN device to perform both frequency doubling of the telecom pump and the wavelength conversion process, resulting in significant crosstalk between adjacent signal channels. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a two-stage TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic circuit that integrates a second-harmonic generation module, a signal wavelength conversion module, and multiple adiabatic directional coupler-based pump filters, on a single chip. By decoupling the two nonlinear processes and leveraging the high pump-filtering extinction ratio, we achieve low-crosstalk AOWC with a side-channel suppression ratio exceeding 25 dB, substantially surpassing the performance of single-stage devices. Furthermore, our device exhibits an ultra-broad conversion bandwidth of 110 nm and a relatively high conversion efficiency of -15.6 dB, making it an attractive solution for future photonic systems. The two-stage AOWC design shows promise for low-noise phase-sensitive amplification and quantum frequency conversion in future classical and quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum storage with flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of robust quantum storage devices relies on the ability to generate long-lived, spatially localized quantum states. In this work, we introduce a method for the targeted creation of compact excitations in flat-band lattices. By injecting in-plane radiation waves from the system's edge and applying a localized on-site potential at the desired storage position, we induce hybridization between compact localized states (CLSs) of the flat-band and resonant dispersive plane waves. This hybridization enables the formation of spatially compact, stable excitations suitable for quantum memory applications. We experimentally validate this mechanism using photonic waveguide arrays, focusing on two representative geometries: the diamond chain and the one-dimensional Lieb ladder. Our approach is broadly applicable to any platform supporting flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Evolution of Coherence, Entropy, and Photon Statistics in Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a fundamental light-matter interaction in which absorbed photons are re-emitted, playing a key role in science and engineering. It is commonly modeled by introducing a non-zero chemical potential into Planck's law to capture its deviation from thermal emission. In this work, we establish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that expresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material properties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to Planck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis of temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy, temporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from narrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a temperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with the previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to thermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy. Conversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the entire temperature range. Alongside its scientific contribution, this framework provides a foundation for designing temperature-tunable light sources, enabling control over coherence length and photon statistics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects (CBSE) in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</description>

Abstract: Broadband active materials are pivotal for advancing emerging technologies spanning on-chip optical interconnects, artificial intelligence, quantum systems and precision metrology. Current semiconductor gain media face bandwidth limitations; and Ttitanium-doped sapphire (Ti:sapphire), the most widely used broadband light-emitting material, covering the red to short-wave near-infrared (SW-NIR) spectrum, lacking emission in the entire visible range. Here, on-chip integrated silicon nitride (SiN) as a versatile active material capable of emitting across a broad spectrum was demonstrated, from blue light to SW-NIR (approximately 450 nm to 1000 nm), mode-hop-free tuning about 1.6 nm at about 738 nm and amplification at about 532.3 nm was achieved. This work transitions SiN from conventional passive photonic material to ultrawide-band active medium, by leveraging the maturity, cost-effectiveness, and CMOS compatibility of SiN photonics.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of second and third harmonic conversion efficiency, angular and temperature tolerance, and long-term stability in LBO crystals using a 10-J-class laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02395v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) in lithium triborate (LBO) crystals using a high-energy, 10-J-class, 10 Hz Yb:YAG laser system. We achieved high conversion efficiencies of 75% for SHG and 56% for THG for Gaussian-like temporal pulse shapes and top-hat-like beam profiles. The angular and temperature dependence of the LBO crystals were measured and validated through numerical simulations. The SHG process exhibited an angular acceptance bandwidth of 1.33 mrad and a temperature acceptance bandwidth of 2.61 K, while the THG process showed 1.19 mrad and 1.35 K, respectively. Additionally, long term stability measurements revealed RMS energy stabilities of 1.3% for SHG and 1.24% for THG. These results showcase the reliability of LBO crystals for high-energy, high-average-power harmonic generation. The developed system offers automated switching between harmonics provided at the system output. The system can be easily adapted to Nd:YAG based pump lasers as well.</description>

      <title>The analytically tractable zoo of similarity-induced exceptional structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m&lt;n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits, to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various branches of physics.</description>

      <title>Narrow-linewidth, piezoelectrically tunable photonic integrated blue laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-agile lasers operating in the ultraviolet-to-blue spectral range (360-480 nm) are critical enablers for a wide range of technologies, including free-space and underwater optical communications, optical atomic clocks, and Rydberg-atom-based quantum computing platforms. Integrated photonic lasers offer a compelling platform for these applications by combining low-noise performance with fast frequency tuning in a compact, robust form factor through monolithic integration. However, realizing such lasers in the blue spectral range remains challenging due to limitations in current semiconductor materials and photonic integration techniques. Here, we report the first demonstration of a photonic integrated blue laser at around 461 nm, which simultaneously achieves frequency agility and low phase noise. This implementation is based on the hybrid integration of a gallium nitride-based laser diode, which is self-injection locked to a high-Q microresonator fabricated on a low-loss silicon nitride photonic platform with 0.4 dB/cm propagation loss. The laser exhibits a sub-30 kHz linewidth and delivers over 1 mW of optical output power. In addition, aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators are monolithically integrated onto the photonic circuitry to enable high-speed modulation of the refractive index, and thus tuning the laser frequency. This enables mode-hop-free laser linear frequency chirps with excursions up to 900 MHz at repetition rates up to 1 MHz, with tuning nonlinearity below 2%. We showcase the potential applications of this integrated laser in underwater communication and coherent aerosol sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Erbium-Doped Fibre Quantum Memory for Chip-Integrated Quantum-Dot Single Photons at 980 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at 980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct compatibility with a solid-state QM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any traditional quantum sensing protocols.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverages OAM structured light as a resource.</description>

      <title>The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 900-1,880 nm) has been pivotal in advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its superior penetration depth and contrast. Yet, its clinical utility remains limited by insufficient imaging temporal-spatial resolution and the absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NIR-II contrast agents. This work presents a frequency-domain denoising (FDD)-based in vivo fluorescence imaging technique, which can improve signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 2,500-fold and 300-fold, respectively. The great enhancement yields a doubled penetration depth and a 95% reduction in contrast agent dosage or excitation light intensity for mouse vascular imaging. Additionally, we achieved a SBR far exceeded the Rose criterion in the observation of tumor margins and vessels in mice using Indocyanine Green (ICG), demonstrating the feasibility of NIR-II surgical navigation with FDA-approved agents. Furthermore, a 600 Hz real-time video enables visualization of the entire contrast agent diffusion process within the mouse body and differentiation between arteries and veins. This innovative technique, characterized by exceptional sensitivity, efficiency, and robustness, presents a promising solution for clinical applications, particularly in NIR-II surgical navigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technology necessitates the development of hybrid optical modulators that integrate silicon photonics with electro-optic (EO) materials to enable ultrafast, low-power, and compact photonic devices. However, no existing material simultaneously meets the requirements for high EO performance, process compatibility, and thermal stability, which are essential for practical optoelectronic integration. Here, we present 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)diphenylamine (NDPA) and its derivative, novel nonlinear optical molecular crystals discovered through materials screening incorporating crystal habit prediction. They demonstrate crystallization into high-quality aligned thin films and ultrafine silicon slot fillings through the capillary action of melts. The resulting EO performance much exceed that of conventional lithium niobate and are comparable to state-of-the-art EO polymers, with excellent thermal stability maintained for over 1000 hours at 393 K. The present EO materials satisfying all the requirements above are promising candidates for silicon-organic hybrid optical modulators, opening a significant step toward scalable and high-performance optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Soliton Transitions Mediated by Skin-Mode Localization and Band Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons, typically resulting from a competition between band dispersion and nonlinearity, occur in lattices featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect as nonlinearity increases, accompanied by a transition in localization from linear skin modes to solitons. However, localization does not disentangle the role of skin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such lattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons (SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally different mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from band nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram of SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we formulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton formation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band nonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode localization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby lowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge dynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning from linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds, originate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary conditions. Our framework offers predictive tools for characterizing and engineering solitons in experimentally realizable non-Hermitian systems, spanning optics to mechanics.</description>

      <title>A kilometer photonic link connecting superconducting circuits in two dilution refrigerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a leading platform for implementing practical quantum computation algorithms. Although superconducting quantum processors with hundreds of qubits have been demonstrated, their further scaling up is constrained by the physical size and cooling power of dilution refrigerators. This constraint can be overcome by constructing a quantum network to interconnect qubits hosted in different refrigerators, which requires microwave-to-optical transducers to enable low-loss signal transmission over long distances. Despite that various designs and demonstrations have achieved high-efficiency and low-added-noise transducers, a coherent photonic link between separate refrigerators has not yet been realized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate coherent signal transfer between two superconducting circuits housed in separate dilution refrigerators, enabled by a pair of frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic transducers connected via a 1-km telecom optical fiber. With transducers at each node achieving &gt;0.1% efficiency, an overall 80 dB improvement in transduction efficiency over commercial electro-optic modulators is attainable, paving the way towards a fully quantum-enabled link. This work provides critical design guidelines towards scalable superconducting quantum networks interconnected by photonic links.</description>

      <title>Generic Optical Singularities in Brewster-reflected Post-paraxial Beam-fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.13421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brewster-reflection of a post-paraxial optical beam at a plane dielectric interface unravels fundamentally significant optical singularity dynamics. We express the simulated field-component profiles of a Brewster-reflected post-paraxial beam-field via empirical functions, using which we demonstrate optical beam-shifts and formation of phase singularities. These occurrences naturally reveal the presence and complex transitional-dynamics of generic polarization-singularities -- which we observe via simulation and experiments. A single reflection being the core process, our method becomes a fundamentally appealing way to generate optical singularities and to study their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing broken time-reversal symmetry with tailored-light photocurrents</title>

Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology. Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation to study time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken phases. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror (spatial) and time-reversal symmetry, individually precluding photocurrents, but when combined can break symmetries and generate photocurrents. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems, as the tailored light maintains TRS while breaking all other spatial symmetries. We then employ state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</description>

      <title>Neural network enabled wide field-of-view imaging with hyperbolic metalenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrathin form factor of metalenses makes them highly appealing for novel sensing and imaging applications. Amongst the various phase profiles, the hyperbolic metalens stands out for being free from spherical aberrations and having one of the highest focusing efficiencies to date. For imaging, however, hyperbolic metalenses present significant off-axis aberrations, severely restricting the achievable field-of-view (FOV). Extending the FOV of hyperbolic metalenses is thus feasible only if these aberrations can be corrected. Here, we demonstrate that a Restormer neural network can be used to correct these severe off-axis aberrations, enabling wide FOV imaging with a hyperbolic metalens camera. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of training the Restormer network purely on simulated datasets of spatially-varying blurred images generated by the eigen-point-spread function (eigenPSF) method, eliminating the need for time-intensive experimental data collection. This reference-free training ensures that Restormer learns solely to correct optical aberrations, resulting in reconstructions that are faithful to the original scene. Using this method, we show that a hyperbolic metalens camera can be used to obtain high-quality imaging over a wide FOV of 54{\deg} in experimentally captured scenes under diverse lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Post-compression of a Q-switched laser in a glass-rod multi-pass cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-switched lasers are compact, cost-effective, and highly pulse energy-scalable sources for nanosecond-scale laser pulses. The technology has been developed for many decades and is widely used in scientific, industrial and medical applications. However, their inherently narrow bandwidth imposes a lower limit on pulse duration - typically in the few-hundred-picosecond range - limiting the applicability of Q-switched technology in fields that require ultrafast laser pulses in the few-picosecond or femtosecond regime. In contrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (&lt; 1 ps) pulses, but are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge the parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse duration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of Q-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally demonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to 24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening. We verify this result numerically and show that compression down to a few picoseconds is possible using the nanosecond MPC (nMPC).</description>

      <title>Topology in the Random Scattering of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scattering in random media is usually considered within the framework of the three-dimensional Anderson universality class, with modifications for the vector nature of electromagnetic waves. We propose that the linear dispersiveness of light introduces topological aspects into the picture. The dynamics of electromagnetic waves follow the same differential equations as those of a spin-$1$ Weyl semimetal. In the presence of disorder, this equivalence leads to a range of phenomena explored in this paper. These include topological protection against localization when helicity hybridization is weak, the emergence of exotic phases in weakly scattering media, and anomalies in optical transparency in the presence of synthetic `magnetic fields'. We argue that some of these effects should be visible and investigated already in weakly disordered optical materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of dispersive shock waves induced by the Raman effect in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dispersive shock waves in optical fibers for the case of long-distance propagation of optical pulses, when the small Raman effect stabilizes the profile of the shock. The Whitham modulation equations are derived as the basis for the Gurevich-Pitaevskii approach to the analytical theory of such shocks. We show that the wave variables at both sides of the shock are related by the analogue of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition that follows from the conservation laws of the Whitham equations. Solutions of the Whitham equations yield the profiles of the wave variables that agree very well with the exact numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation for propagation of optical pulses.</description>
