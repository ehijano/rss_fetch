      <title>Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</description>

      <title>Active alignment-driven coarsening in confined near-critical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of an active near critical Lennard-Jones fluid confined within a cylindrical pore using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is introduced via Vicsek-type alignment interactions, enabling a systematic study of how self-propulsion modifies domain morphology and coarsening kinetics under quasi-one-dimensional confinement. In the passive limit, the system undergoes early-time spinodal decomposition (diffusive growth characterized by the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent $\alpha = 1/3$), followed by the formation of periodically modulated, plug-like liquid domains along the pore axis. At late times, coarsening becomes kinetically arrested, and the system remains trapped in a metastable striped state. Introducing activity destabilizes this arrested morphology by enhancing collective domain transport, leading to frequent domain mergers and complete phase separation at sufficiently high activity. The late-stage coarsening then exhibits a crossover to faster, ballistic growth with an effective exponent $\alpha = 2/3$, consistent with a cluster-coalescence mechanism. Analysis of two-point correlation functions and structure factors confirms dynamic scaling across all activity regimes. Our results demonstrate that alignment-induced activity can overcome confinement-driven kinetic arrest, providing new insight into phase separation in confined active fluids. The relevant growth laws are analyzed and interpreted using appropriate theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Entropic Colloidal Crystal Prediction: A Quantum Density Functional Theory Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of a colloidal analogue to quantum density functional theory (DFT) predictions of atomic crystal structures, we report a new, classical DFT that predicts the relative thermodynamic stability of colloidal crystals of hard, convex particle shapes. In contrast to standard classical DFT approaches, our theory maps the hard particle system to an auxiliary system in which we treat the particles as fixed "nuclei" embedded in a fictitious, spatially varying density field that distributes throughout the auxiliary system. By minimizing the free energy of the auxiliary system, and through comparison with known equations of state and free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration, we show that the auxiliary system with the lowest free energy corresponds to the most probable crystal of hard shapes in the original system.</description>

      <title>Representative-volume sizing in finite cylindrical computed tomography by low-wavenumber spectral convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $\mu$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity'' field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected. Applied to a segmented \textit{Thalassinoides} core, the method identifies a minimum analysis cylinder of approximately $D_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 93~\mathrm{mm}$ and $H_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 83~\mathrm{mm}$, enabling reproducible correlation-scale reporting and connectivity-sensitive property estimation.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Micellar Architecture and Viscosity Governs Active Droplet Motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autonomous motion of liquid crystal oil droplets in micellar media arises from spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry via nonlinear coupling between Marangoni stresses and surfactant transport. While this phenomenon has been widely studied, the influence of micellar solute structure remains unexplored. By modifying micellar architecture using a structure forming salt, we uncover a pronounced non monotonic dependence of droplet velocity on salt concentration. Increasing salt simultaneously raises the medium viscosity and drives a transition of micelles from spherical to rod-like or worm like morphologies. Using complementary experiments, we quantify the viscosity and micellar interaction lengthscale as functions of the salt to surfactant ratio and develop a theoretical model that consistently reproduces the measured propulsion speeds. Flow fields around the droplets are characterized by particle image velocimetry. Our results demonstrate that salt surfactant composition governs active droplet propulsion by jointly controlling micellar solute interaction lengthscales and medium viscosity.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion with soft constraints in soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stiff forces, which bind objects together or otherwise confine motion, are found widely in soft-matter systems - colloids with short range attractions, ligand-receptor contacts, particles in optical traps, fibres that resist stretching, etc. To assess the long-term effect of these stiff forces on dynamics and structure, it is useful to consider the limit where they are treated as constraints, so the system evolves strictly within allowed configurations. Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions. We hope our results will be useful for soft matter research, as a robust toolkit for studying tethered or confined systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and ordering kinetics in asymmetric PS-b-PMMA block copolymer thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.08120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ordering kinetics of standing cylinder-forming polystyrene-block-poly (methyl methacrylate) block copolymers (molecular weight: 39 kg/mol) close to the order-disorder transition is experimentally investigated following the temporal evolution of the correlation length at different annealing temperatures. The grow exponent of the grain coarsening process is determined to be 1/2, signature of a curvature driven ordering mechanism. The measured activation enthalpy and the resulting Meyer-Neldel temperature for this specific copolymer along with the data already known for PS-b-PMMA block copolymers in strong segregation limit, allows investigating the interplay between the ordering kinetics and the thermodynamic driving force during the grain coarsening. These findings unveil various phenomena concomitantly occurring during the thermally activated ordering kinetics at segmental, single chain, and collective level.</description>

      <title>Measurable geometric indicators of local plasticity in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of defects in crystalline phases of matter has been extremely powerful for understanding crystal growth, deformation and melting. Many of these discontinuities in the periodic order of crystals are well described by the Burgers vector, derived from the particle displacements, which encapsulates the direction and magnitude of slip relative to the undeformed state. Since the reference structure of the crystal is known a priori, the Burgers vector can be determined experimentally using both imaging and diffraction methods to measure the final lattice distortion, and thus infer the particle displacements. Glasses have structures that lack the periodicity of crystals, and thus a well-defined reference state. Yet, measurable structural parameters can still be obtained from diffraction from a glass. Here we examine the usefulness of these parameters to probe deformation in glasses. We find that co-ordinated transformations in the centrosymmetry of local particle arrangements are a strong marker of plastic events. For a glass, determining the local distortions corresponding to these plastic events requires measurements before and after deformation. We investigate two geometric indicators that can be derived from these distortions, namely the continuous Burgers vector and the quadrupolar strain. We find that the Burgers vector again emerges as a robust and sensitive metric for understanding local structural transformations due to mechanical deformation, even in disordered glasses.</description>

      <title>Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with opto-iontronic microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate an optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ratchet Principle: When Hidden Symmetries Prevent Steady Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle", which states that non-equilibrium systems violating parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents, is one of the few generic results outside thermal equilibrium. We study exceptions to this principle observed in active and passive systems with spatially varying fluctuations sources. For dilute systems, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry prevents the emergence of ratchet currents. At higher densities, pairwise forces break this symmetry but an emergent conservation law for the momentum field may nevertheless prevent steady currents. We show how the presence of this conservation law can be tested analytically and characterize the onset of ratchet currents in its absence. Our results show that the ratchet principle should be amended to preclude parity symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and bulk momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, numerical simulations show the tracer to transition from an active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to an effective equilibrium regime. To account for this analytically, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence, in the large density limit, to an equilibrium dynamics at the bath temperature. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel or a soft active solid, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.</description>

      <title>Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (a)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Enhanced reversible barocaloric effect at low pressure in neopentyl plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants with lower environmental impact than vapour compression fluids. Optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without compromising thermodynamic parameters. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine (PG) with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with 2% pentaerythritol (PE) to improve transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG under the same conditions, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|$\Delta S_{(it,rev)}$ | = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and quasielastic neutron scattering reveal structural and dynamical effects that broaden the temperature range of the first-order phase transition due to intermolecular hydrogen bond network disruption by the molecular dopants. We propose that exploiting the compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is effective for designing practicable molecular BCs.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like Model for Chemotactic Navigation in Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a physical framework for ant navigation of chemical trails. For this, we use controlled experiments in which individuals follow narrow pheromone trails, for which ants display oscillatory motion, as previously reported in the literature. We model this behavior by treating chemotaxis as an effective magnetic interaction between the ant velocity and the local chemical gradient. Under suitable approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations in the direction perpendicular to the trail, predicting an underdamped oscillatory decay. This theoretical prediction is in qualitative agreement with our experimental measurements, indicating that the model captures the essential dynamical features of ant trail following. We fit the model parameters to individual trajectories in order to assess the consistency of the underlying assumptions, finding the same parameter relationship in both theory and experiment. Our results contribute to the characterization of chemotactic navigation in ants and illustrate how physical modeling can provide mechanistic insights into complex biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>
