      <title>Cosmos: A CXL-Based Full In-Memory System for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is crucial for improving the quality of large language models by injecting proper contexts extracted from external sources. RAG requires high-throughput, low-latency Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over billion-scale vector databases. Conventional DRAM/SSD solutions face capacity/latency limits, whereas specialized hardware or RDMA clusters lack flexibility or incur network overhead. We present Cosmos, integrating general-purpose cores within CXL memory devices for full ANNS offload and introducing rank-level parallel distance computation to maximize memory bandwidth. We also propose an adjacency-aware data placement that balances search loads across CXL devices based on inter-cluster proximity. Evaluations on SIFT1B and DEEP1B traces show that Cosmos achieves up to 6.72x higher throughput than the baseline CXL system and 2.35x over a state-of-the-art CXL-based solution, demonstrating scalability for RAG pipelines.</description>

      <title>How to keep pushing ML accelerator performance? Know your rooflines!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing importance of Machine Learning (ML) applications, coupled with their ever-increasing model size and inference energy footprint, has created a strong need for specialized ML hardware architectures. Numerous ML accelerators have been explored and implemented, primarily to increase task-level throughput per unit area and reduce task-level energy consumption. This paper surveys key trends toward these objectives for more efficient ML accelerators and provides a unifying framework to understand how compute and memory technologies/architectures interact to enhance system-level efficiency and performance. To achieve this, the paper introduces an enhanced version of the roofline model and applies it to ML accelerators as an effective tool for understanding where various execution regimes fall within roofline bounds and how to maximize performance and efficiency under the rooline. Key concepts are illustrated with examples from state-of-the-art designs, with a view towards open research opportunities to further advance accelerator performance.</description>

      <title>DAS-MP: Enabling High-Quality Macro Placement with Enhanced Dataflow Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataflow is a critical yet underexplored factor in automatic macro placement, which is becoming increasingly important for developing intelligent design automation techniques that minimize reliance on manual adjustments and reduce design iterations. Existing macro or mixed-size placers with dataflow awareness primarily focus on intrinsic relationships among macros, overlooking the crucial influence of standard cell clusters on macro placement. To address this, we propose DAS-MP, which extracts hidden connections between macros and standard cells and incorporates a series of algorithms to enhance dataflow awareness, integrating them into placement constraints for improved macro placement. To further optimize placement results, we introduce two fine-tuning steps: (1) congestion optimization by taking macro area into consideration, and (2) flipping decisions to determine the optimal macro orientation based on the extracted dataflow information. By integrating enhanced dataflow awareness into placement constraints and applying these fine-tuning steps, the proposed approach achieves an average 7.9% improvement in half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) across multiple widely used benchmark designs compared to a state-of-the-art dataflow-aware macro placer. Additionally, it significantly improves congestion, reducing overflow by an average of 82.5%, and achieves improvements of 36.97% in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and 59.44% in Total Negative Slack (TNS). The approach also maintains efficient runtime throughout the entire placement process, incurring less than a 1.5% runtime overhead. These results show that the proposed dataflow-driven methodology, combined with the fine-tuning steps, provides an effective foundation for macro placement and can be seamlessly integrated into existing design flows to enhance placement quality.</description>

      <title>CASS: Nvidia to AMD Transpilation with Data, Models, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \texttt{CASS}, the first large-scale dataset and model suite for cross-architecture GPU code transpilation, targeting both source-level (CUDA~$\leftrightarrow$~HIP) and assembly-level (Nvidia SASS~$\leftrightarrow$~AMD RDNA3) translation. The dataset comprises 70k verified code pairs across host and device, addressing a critical gap in low-level GPU code portability. Leveraging this resource, we train the \texttt{CASS} family of domain-specific language models, achieving 95\% source translation accuracy and 37.5\% assembly translation accuracy, substantially outperforming commercial baselines such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Hipify. Our generated code matches native performance in over 85\% of test cases, preserving runtime and memory behavior. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce \texttt{CASS-Bench}, a curated benchmark spanning 16 GPU domains with ground-truth execution. All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as open source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility, and LLM-guided hardware translation. Dataset and benchmark are on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/cass}{\textcolor{blue}{HuggingFace}}, with code at \href{https://github.com/GustavoStahl/CASS}{\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}.</description>

Abstract: Given their increasing size and complexity, the need for efficient execution of deep neural networks has become increasingly pressing in the design of heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) and edge platforms, leading to a wide variety of proposals for specialized deep learning architectures and hardware accelerators. The design of such architectures and accelerators requires a multidisciplinary approach combining expertise from several areas, from machine learning to computer architecture, low-level hardware design, and approximate computing. Several methodologies and tools have been proposed to improve the process of designing accelerators for deep learning, aimed at maximizing parallelism and minimizing data movement to achieve high performance and energy efficiency. This paper critically reviews influential tools and design methodologies for Deep Learning accelerators, offering a wide perspective in this rapidly evolving field. This work complements surveys on architectures and accelerators by covering hardware-software co-design, automated synthesis, domain-specific compilers, design space exploration, modeling, and simulation, providing insights into technical challenges and open research directions.</description>
