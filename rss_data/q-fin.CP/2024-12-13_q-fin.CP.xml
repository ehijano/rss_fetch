      <title>High-dimensional covariance matrix estimators on simulated portfolios with complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the allocation of synthetic portfolios under hierarchical nested, one-factor, and diagonal structures of the population covariance matrix in a high-dimensional scenario. The noise reduction approaches for the sample realizations are based on random matrices, free probability, deterministic equivalents, and their combination with a data science hierarchical method known as two-step covariance estimators. The financial performance metrics from the simulations are compared with empirical data from companies comprising the S&amp;P 500 index using a moving window and walk-forward analysis. The portfolio allocation strategies analyzed include the minimum variance portfolio (both with and without short-selling constraints) and the hierarchical risk parity approach. Our proposed hierarchical nested covariance model shows signatures of complex system interactions. The empirical financial data reproduces stylized portfolio facts observed in the complex and one-factor covariance models. The two-step estimators proposed here improve several financial metrics under the analyzed investment strategies. The results pave the way for new risk management and diversification approaches when the number of assets is of the same order as the number of transaction days in the investment portfolio.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric Analysis for the Pricing of Financial Derivatives with Nonlinear Models: Convertible Bonds and Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational efficiency is essential for enhancing the accuracy and practicality of pricing complex financial derivatives. In this paper, we discuss Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for valuing financial derivatives, modeled by two nonlinear Black-Scholes PDEs: the Leland model for European call with transaction costs and the AFV model for convertible bonds with default options. We compare the solutions of IGA with finite difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM). In particular, very accurate solutions can be numerically calculated on far less mesh (knots) than FDM or FEM, by using non-uniform knots and weighted cubic NURBS, which in turn reduces the computational time significantly.</description>

      <title>Geometric Deep Learning for Realized Covariance Matrix Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods employed in matrix volatility forecasting often overlook the inherent Riemannian manifold structure of symmetric positive definite matrices, treating them as elements of Euclidean space, which can lead to suboptimal predictive performance. Moreover, they often struggle to handle high-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting realized covariance matrices of asset returns using a Riemannian-geometry-aware deep learning framework. In this way, we account for the geometric properties of the covariance matrices, including possible non-linear dynamics and efficient handling of high-dimensionality. Moreover, building upon a Fr\'echet sample mean of realized covariance matrices, we are able to extend the HAR model to the matrix-variate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using daily realized covariance matrices for the 50 most capitalized companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, showing that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>AlphaForge: A Framework to Mine and Dynamically Combine Formulaic Alpha Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of financial data, characterized by its variability and low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitates advanced methods in quantitative investment that prioritize both performance and interpretability.Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in the alpha factor mining domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment and real money investment.</description>
