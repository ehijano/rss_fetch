      <title>Design and simulation of the High-Energy Proton Beam Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-resolution beam telescope is essential for the precise characterization of silicon pixel sensors. As part of the CSNS-II upgrade project, a High-Energy Proton Beam Telescope (HEPTel) based on monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) has been designed for the forthcoming High-Energy Proton Experimental Station (HPES), which will provide 0.8 to 1.6 GeV single-particle proton beams. HEPTel consists of six ultra-thin telescope modules, with a material budget per module of about 0.061% X0. Simulated with a 1.6 GeV proton beam, the telescope is expected to achieve a resolution of about 1.83 micrometers. Additionally, a dedicated readout electronics system and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system have been designed for HEPTel, based on which a preliminary test system was established for beam tests. The beam test results with 1.3 GeV electrons demonstrated a single-module resolution of about 5.77 micrometers, an overall telescope resolution of about 2.70 micrometers, and a detection efficiency above 99.5%. These results validate the HEPTel design and confirm its capability for forthcoming proton-beam experiments at HPES.</description>

      <title>Excavation of a 69-m diameter and 94-m high cavern for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete. Measuring 69 m in diameter and 94 m in height, it is among the world's largest rock caverns. A vertically oriented, dome-capped cylindrical design was chosen to optimize cost and performance. Combined with substantial overburden, the geometry posed major engineering challenges. This paper outlines the underground works, main cavern design, excavation plan, and the evolution of support design and construction methods during excavation, namely the information-based (observational) design and construction approach.</description>

      <title>Review of prototypes developed in a 65 nm CMOS imaging technology in view of vertexing applications at a future lepton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OCTOPUS project addresses the development and characterization of monolithic active pixel sensors in the TPSCo 65 nm ISC technology in view of vertexing applications at a future lepton collider. Meeting the corresponding requirements -- outlined in the ECFA detector road map -- will necessitate the simulation, design, and testing of prototypes and a demonstrator chip in this very process.
  This work reviews the literature on existing prototypes, summarizing their design characteristics, properties, and performance in charged-particle detection, and provides an overview of previous simulation efforts. The presented results suggest the feasibility of the endeavor while showcasing challenges, the need for further investigations, and providing a foundation for imminent design choices.</description>

      <title>Compositional Metrology of Atom Probe Applied to non-Metallic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two decades after its introduction, laser-assisted Atom Probe Tomography (La-APT) has demonstrated a unique potential for the study of the 3D distribution of atomic species in semiconductor materials and devices, and in a growing list of inorganic non-metallic solids. A crucial and often underestimated issue with APT is its accuracy in compositional measurements of non-metallic systems. This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials.</description>

      <title>ARAPUCA, light trapping device for the DUNE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be the first mega-science program on the US soil and will shade light on some of the open questions in neutrino physics. The experiment foresees the realization of an intense neutrino beam at Fermilab (Chicago - USA), of a near detector to monitor the beam and a far detector installed in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), 1300 km far away. Four 10 kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) will compose the 40 kt far detector modules to perform the precise measurements required for DUNE. The experimental technique uses charge and light signal from ionizing radiations in liquid argon to fully reconstruct neutrino interactions with excellent spatial resolution, calorimetric measurements and particle identification.
  The liquid argon scintillation light is produced around 127 nm within a few nanoseconds from the radiation passage. Its detection may improve the LArTPC calorimetric besides giving the time stamp of non-beam events, which is vital in fiducializing nucleon-decay events. The DUNE Photon Detection System (PDS) is responsible to efficiently collect this light in order to fiducialize the active volume of the detector with $&gt;99\%$ efficiency. The PDS will be composed by 1,500 X-ARAPUCA modules, a light trapping device that was the main subject of this thesis.
  In this work, the research and development of the ARAPUCA devices will be presented. The full characterization of the prototypes were performed in dedicated liquid argon tests, in Brazil and Italy, where comparable efficiencies of (2.2 $\pm$ 0.4)% and (1.9 $\pm$ 0.1)% were found. A new wavelength shifter developed in Italy in collaboration with the Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca will be presented. It allowed to increase the light detection efficiency of about 50% and resulted in an overall efficiency of (2.9 $\pm$ 0.1)% of the X-ARAPUCA.</description>

      <title>Advancements and future expansions of the Caribou DAQ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caribou is a versatile data acquisition (DAQ) system developed within several collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&amp;D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, and Tangerine) to support laboratory and test-beam characterization of novel silicon pixel detectors. It combines a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board with a Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) running project-wide shared firmware and software stacks. The system architecture emphasizes reusability, flexibility, and ease of integration. The CaR board provides essential interfaces such as programmable power supplies, voltage and current references, high-speed ADCs, and configurable I/O lines for detector control and readout. The SoC runs an embedded Linux distribution built with PetaLinux and integrates two main components: Peary, a C++ embedded DAQ application providing hardware abstraction, configuration management, logging, and multi-device control through Command Line (CLI) and Python interfaces; and Boreal, a common Caribou FPGA firmware framework offering reusable modules and automated build workflows for user-specific bit files. The next major milestone in Caribou's evolution is the transition to version 2.0, based on a Zynq UltraScale+ System-on-Module (SoM) architecture. This paper presents the recent progress and future prospects of the project and describes recent hardware, firmware, and software developments preparing the system for the upcoming CaR board v2.0.</description>

      <title>Doberman: a modular and distributed slow control system for small- to medium-scale experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Doberman (Detector OBsERving and Monitoring ApplicatioN), a lightweight, modular, and open-source slow control system designed for small-to medium-scale physics experiments. Doberman addresses the gap between heavyweight industrial SCADA frameworks and ad hoc laboratory solutions by providing a flexible software architecture that supports heterogeneous instrumentation, distributed deployment, automated control, and robust alarm handling. The web-based graphical user interface Doberview provides live and continuously updated visualization, configuration, and control of the entire experiment, supporting both routine operation and rapid response to exceptional conditions. Doberman has been deployed and validated in multiple experimental setups, ranging from a remotely operated underground gamma-ray spectrometer to a large, highly instrumented liquid xenon test facility with several hundred monitored quantities.
  Doberman and Doberview are released under permissive open-source licenses, and the software, documentation, and example device integrations are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</description>

      <title>A Helical-Deflector-Based Radio-Frequency Spiral Scanning System for keV Energy Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a radio-frequency based time-to-position conversion system for keV electrons incorporating a helical deflector operating in the 400-1000 MHz range. The device performs circular deflection of the electrons when driven by a single RF frequency and enables spiral scanning when two phase-locked RF voltages with slightly different frequencies are applied. The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning.</description>

      <title>Hanbury Brown-Twiss interference with massively parallel spectral multiplexing for broadband light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference is a fundamental resource for quantum technologies and optical quantum computing, underpinning precision measurements, scalable entanglement distribution, and the operation of photonic circuits and quantum network protocols. Here, we report the first demonstration of massively parallel, wavelength-resolved photon bunching, revealing Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations across 100 independent spectral channels. These observations are enabled by a fast, data-driven single-photon spectrometer that achieves 40 pm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolution over a 10 nm bandwidth, providing simultaneous access to spectro-temporal photon correlations without the need for narrowband filtering. This approach preserves photon flux while enabling high-dimensional quantum interference measurements across a broad spectrum. Our results establish frequency-multiplexed two-photon interference as a scalable and throughput-efficient platform for quantum-enhanced photonic technologies, offering a practical route toward room-temperature architectures that overcome loss limitations and advance the scalability for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Magnetic Sensitivity Measurements of Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.</description>
