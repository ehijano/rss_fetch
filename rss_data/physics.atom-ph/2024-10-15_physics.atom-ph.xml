      <title>Vacuum Polarization Effects in the Hyperfine Splitting of Hydrogen Like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure of bound electrons in hydrogen-like ions is considered with corrections to the energy levels due to vacuum polarization (VP). Corrections to the wave function as well as the magnetic potential are determined for both leptonic and hadronic VP. Hadronic VP is treated with a semi-empirical approach. Uncertainties due to the nuclear charge distribution are given and discussed. Point-like, spherical and Fermi distributed nuclear models are considered and the differences of the results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ionization of Rydberg atoms embedded in Ultracold Plasma due to electron-atom interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When ultracold plasma is generated using photonization of laser cooled atoms, some atoms reach only upto Rydberg states. These in turn interact with the free electrons of the plasma and get ionized further. We study the interaction of electron-Rydberg atom using potential scattering technique in quantum mechanical domain and compute the associated cross sections for Cesium atoms, analytically. We notice a close agreement with the experimental data of ionization of Rydberg atoms as reported in Phys. Rev. A 71, 013416 (2005). The experiments showed a rapid increase in ionization above a specific Rydberg state. Our theory supports the same, and also indicates that this is due to the relation between scattering length and the radius of the orbit.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the hyperfine structure of $nP_J$ Rydberg states by microwave spectroscopy in Cs atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of hyperfine structure (HFS) of the $nP_J$ Rydberg states for large principal quantum number $n$ range ($n=41-55$) employing the microwave spectroscopy in an ultra-cold cesium Rydberg ensemble. A microwave field with 30-$\mu$s duration couples the $ nS \to nP $ transition, yielding a narrow linewidth spectroscopy that approaches the Fourier limit, which allows us to resolve the hyperfine structure of $ nP_J $ states. By analyzing the hyperfine splittings of $nP_J$ states, we determine the magnetic-dipole HFS coupling constant $\bar{A}_{HFS,P_{1/2}}=3.760(26) ~$GHz for $P_{1/2}$ state, $\bar{A}_{HFS,P_{3/2}}= 0.718(27)~$GHz, and $ \bar{B}_{HFS,P_{3/2}}= -0.084(102)~$GHz for $P_{3/2}$ state, respectively. Systematic uncertainties caused by stray electromagnetic field, microwave field power and Rydberg interaction are analyzed. This measurement is significant for the investigation of Rydberg electrometry and quantum simulation with dipole interaction involving $nP_J$ state.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Quantum gases in bubble traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a review and perspective on quantum gases in bubble traps. We emphasize how the idea of realizing shell shaped condensates emerged and was enabled by the invention of the radiofrequency adiabatic potential technique. We review the many subsequent theoretical works that address the new physics emerging for a condensate trapped on a closed surface. We present the current status of the experiments, the challenges ahead and highlight how a different approach using an immiscible mixture of two condensates enabled the first observation of a shell-shaped degenerate gas. Finally we list a few open questions that we believe provide interesting research directions.</description>

      <title>Improved bound-electron g-factor theory through complete two-loop QED calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-loop self-energy correction to the bound-electron $g$-factor in hydrogenlike ions is investigated, taking into account the electron-nucleus interaction exactly. This all-order calculation is required to improve the total theoretical uncertainty of the $g$-factor, which is limited by the fact that two-loop self-energy corrections have only been calculated so far in the form of an expansion in $Z\alpha$. Here, $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant. In this work, we report calculations of the last missing parts of the total two-loop self-energy correction, exactly in $Z\alpha$. We apply our theory to the recently measured $g$-factor of the hydrogenlike $^{118}$Sn$^{49+}$ ion [J. Morgner et al., Nature 622, 53 (2023)] and, with a factor of 8, improve the accuracy of its state-of-the-art theoretical value by almost one order of magnitude, enabling more detailed tests of quantum electrodynamics and new physics in strong fields.</description>

      <title>Minutes-scale Schr{\"o}dinger-cat state of spin-5/2 atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology with nonclassical states offers a promising route to improved precision in physical measurements. The quantum effects of Schr{\"o}dinger-cat superpositions or entanglements allow measurement uncertainties to reach below the standard quantum limit. However, the challenge in keeping a long coherence time for such nonclassical states often prevents full exploitation of the quantum advantage in metrology. Here we demonstrate a long-lived Schr{\"o}dinger-cat state of optically trapped $^{173}$Yb (\textit{I}\ =\ 5/2) atoms. The cat state, a superposition of two oppositely-directed and furthest-apart spin states, is generated by a non-linear spin rotation. Protected in a decoherence-free subspace against inhomogeneous light shifts of an optical lattice, the cat state achieves a coherence time of $1.4(1)\times 10^3$ s. A magnetic field is measured with Ramsey interferometry, demonstrating a scheme of Heisenberg-limited metrology for atomic magnetometry, quantum information processing, and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Impurities and polarons in bosonic quantum gases: a review on recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review describes the field of Bose polarons, arising when mobile impurities are immersed into a bosonic quantum gas. The latter can be realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental observations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we survey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic roots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize state-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron models, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian that applies at weak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used for solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections are devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose polarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra obtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body and Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to studies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in low-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation; and to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed discussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic impurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and extensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or strong interactions relevant for correlated electrons. Finally, an outlook is presented, highlighting possible future research directions and open questions in the field as a whole.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

      <title>In-depth Study of Spin- and Momentum-Dependent Interaction Potentials Between Two Spin-1/2 Fermions Mediated by Light Spin-0 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation by including the relativistic and off-shell contributions to the interaction potentials between two spin-1/2 fermions mediated by the exchange of light spin-0 particles, in both momentum and coordinate spaces. Our calculation is based on the four-point Green function rather than the scattering amplitude. Among the sixteen potential components, eight that vanish in the non-relativistic limit are shown to acquire nonzero relativistic and off-shell corrections. In addition to providing relativistic and off-shell corrections to the operator basis commonly used in the literature, we introduce an alternative operator basis that facilitates the derivation of interaction potentials in coordinate space. Furthermore, we calculate both the long-range and short-range components of the potentials, which can be useful for future experimental analyses at both macroscopic and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.</description>

      <title>Five-fold precision enhancement in a cold atom experiment via adaptive symmetry-informed Bayesian strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian methods promise enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection. We demonstrate an adaptive Bayesian measurement strategy for atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment, utilising a symmetry-informed loss function. Compared to a standard unoptimised strategy, our method yields a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with 40% fewer data points. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any quantity amenable to symmetry-informed strategies, facilitating the application of these strategies in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1927, during the fifth Solvay Conference, Einstein and Bohr described a double-slit interferometer with a "movable slit" that can detect the momentum recoil of one photon. Here, we report a faithful realization of the Einstein-Bohr interferometer using a single atom in an optical tweezer, cooled to the motional ground state in three dimensions. The single atom has an intrinsic momentum uncertainty comparable to a single photon, which serves as a movable slit obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The atom's momentum wavefunction is dynamically tunable by the tweezer laser power, which enables observation of an interferometric visibility reduction at a shallower trap, demonstrating the quantum nature of this interferometer. We further identify classical noise due to atom heating and precession, illustrating a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Integrating them with an optical cavity enables fast nondestructive qubit readout and access to fast remote entanglement generation for quantum networking. Here, we introduce a platform for coupling single atoms in optical tweezers to a Fabry-Perot Fiber Cavity. Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrate fast qubit state readout with 99.960$^{+14}_{-24}\%$ fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we use cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)$\%$ fidelity and a 32(1)$\%$ success rate. Second, we perform a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)$\%$, increased to 76(2)$\%$ with error detection. The new capabilities enabled by this platform pave the way towards modular quantum computing and networking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric-quadrupole transition, and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.10177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical quantum memories, which store and preserve the quantum state of photons, rely on a coherent mapping of the photonic state onto matter states that are optically accessible. Here we outline and characterize schemes to map the state of photons onto long-lived but optically-inaccessible collective states of noble-gas spins. The mapping employs coherent spin-exchange interaction arising from random collisions with alkali vapor. We propose efficient storage strategies in two operating regimes and analyze their performance for several proposed experimental configurations.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.</description>

      <title>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit gates and Schr\"odinger cat states in an optical clock</title>

Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: for constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient on most input states, is also classically simulable on most input states.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>

Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>
