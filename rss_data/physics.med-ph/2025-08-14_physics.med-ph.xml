      <title>Simulation of Repair on Dynamic Patient-Specific Left Atrioventricular Valve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a dynamic, image-derived patient-specific physical simulation platform for the assessment of left atrioventricular valve (LAVV) repair strategies in pediatric patients with repaired atrioventricular canal defects. Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two patients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database. Custom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus, and generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were fabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological conditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency, and multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific models. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for annular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7) but higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume: 18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft closure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but the Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9 mmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2, no repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch augmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the smallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV repair evaluation. This proof-of-concept work highlights the platform potential for refining repair strategies before clinical application, which may be particularly relevant in small and heterogeneous populations with congenital heart disease.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Reconstruction of the Speed of Sound in Ring-Array Ultrasound Computed Tomography with Randomized Super-Shots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring-array ultrasound computed tomography has recently achieved sufficient maturity for clinical applications like breast imaging. Image reconstruction is achieved with state of art iterative algorithms (full waveform inversion in the frequency domain). In this Letter, we consider a stochastic reconstruction in the time-domain. We introduce the notion of multiple super-shots and stochastic ensembles and test our inversion algorithm on publicly available experimental data. Our results show that image quality of a time-domain stochastic reconstruction may be comparable to image quality of a deterministic reconstruction in the frequency-domain, although the time-domain reconstruction is significantly slower.</description>

      <title>3D-1D modelling of cranial mesh heating induced by low or medium frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial meshes or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. The proposed method is compared with measurements performed on a cranial mesh exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging. Then, it is applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial mesh is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment. The experimental comparison of the proposed method predictions and the measurement data shows an improved accuracy near the maximum temperature increase up to 25% with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The application of the proposed method applied to the magnetic hyperthermia case study leads to a prediction of the maximum temperature increase that is 10% lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds. At the same time, the proposed method corrects the underestimation of the thermal seeds in the regions where the electromagnetic power is not directly deposited and the temperature increase is only due to heat transfer. The proposed method leads to improved results with respect to previous approximations by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants.</description>
