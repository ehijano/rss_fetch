      <title>PETIMOT: A Novel Framework for Inferring Protein Motions from Sparse Data Using SE(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins move and deform to ensure their biological functions. Despite significant progress in protein structure prediction, approximating conformational ensembles at physiological conditions remains a fundamental open problem. This paper presents a novel perspective on the problem by directly targeting continuous compact representations of protein motions inferred from sparse experimental observations. We develop a task-specific loss function enforcing data symmetries, including scaling and permutation operations. Our method PETIMOT (Protein sEquence and sTructure-based Inference of MOTions) leverages transfer learning from pre-trained protein language models through an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network. When trained and evaluated on the Protein Data Bank, PETIMOT shows superior performance in time and accuracy, capturing protein dynamics, particularly large/slow conformational changes, compared to state-of-the-art flow-matching approaches and traditional physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Determining Conformational Ensembles of Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered proteins play essential roles in myriad cellular processes, yet their structural characterization remains a major challenge due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. We here present a community-driven initiative to address this problem by advocating a unified framework for determining conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. Our aim is to integrate state-of-the-art experimental techniques with advanced computational methods, including knowledge-based sampling, enhanced molecular dynamics, and machine learning models. The modular framework comprises three interconnected components: experimental data acquisition, computational ensemble generation, and validation. The systematic development of this framework will ensure the accurate and reproducible determination of conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. We highlight the open challenges necessary to achieve this goal, including force field accuracy, efficient sampling, and environmental dependency, advocating for collaborative benchmarking and standardized protocols.</description>

      <title>UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</description>
