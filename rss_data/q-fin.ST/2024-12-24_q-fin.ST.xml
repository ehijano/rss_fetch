      <title>Online High-Frequency Trading Stock Forecasting with Automated Feature Clustering and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an autonomous experimental machine learning protocol for high-frequency trading (HFT) stock price forecasting that involves a dual competitive feature importance mechanism and clustering via shallow neural network topology for fast training. By incorporating the k-means algorithm into the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), the proposed method addresses the challenges of manual clustering and the reliance on potentially uninformative features. More specifically, our approach involves a dual competitive mechanism for feature importance, combining the mean-decrease impurity (MDI) method and a gradient descent (GD) based feature importance mechanism. This approach, tested on HFT Level 1 order book data for 20 S\&amp;P 500 stocks, enhances the forecasting ability of the RBFNN regressor. Our findings suggest that an autonomous approach to feature selection and clustering is crucial, as each stock requires a different input feature space. Overall, by automating the feature selection and clustering processes, we remove the need for manual topological grid search and provide a more efficient way to predict LOB's mid-price.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fintech Marketing: A Comparative Study of Logistic Regression and XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As several studies have shown, predicting credit risk is still a major concern for the financial services industry and is receiving a lot of scholarly interest. This area of study is crucial because it aids financial organizations in determining the probability that borrowers would default, which has a direct bearing on lending choices and risk management tactics. Despite the progress made in this domain, there is still a substantial knowledge gap concerning consumer actions that take place prior to the filing of credit card applications. The objective of this study is to predict customer responses to mail campaigns and assess the likelihood of default among those who engage. This research employs advanced machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and XGBoost, to analyze consumer behavior and predict responses to direct mail campaigns. By integrating different data preprocessing strategies, including imputation and binning, we enhance the robustness and accuracy of our predictive models. The results indicate that XGBoost consistently outperforms logistic regression across various metrics, particularly in scenarios using categorical binning and custom imputation. These findings suggest that XGBoost is particularly effective in handling complex data structures and provides a strong predictive capability in assessing credit risk.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Conditional Mean and Covariance for Unbalanced Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric, kernel-based joint estimator for conditional mean and covariance matrices in large and unbalanced panels. The estimator is supported by rigorous consistency results and finite-sample guarantees, ensuring its reliability for empirical applications in Finance. We apply it to an extensive panel of monthly US stock excess returns from 1962 to 2021, using macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates as conditioning variables. The estimator effectively captures time-varying cross-sectional dependencies, demonstrating robust statistical and economic performance. We find that idiosyncratic risk explains, on average, more than 75% of the cross-sectional variance.</description>
