      <title>Quantum theory of a potential biological magnetic field sensor: radical pair mechanism in flavin adenine dinucleotide biradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) on its own might be able to act as a biological magnetic field sensor. Motivated by these observations, in this study, we develop a detailed quantum theoretical model for the radical pair mechanism (RPM) for the flavin adenine biradical within the FAD molecule. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the distance between the radicals on FAD, which we then feed into a quantum master equation treatment of the RPM. In contrast to previous semi-classical models which are limited to the low-field and high-field cases, our quantum model can predict the full magnetic field dependence of the transient absorption signal. Our model's predictions are consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>A novel optical assay system for bilirubin concentration measurement in whole blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a biomarker for liver disease, bilirubin has been utilized in prognostic scoring systems for cirrhosis. While laboratory-based methods are used to determine bilirubin levels in clinical settings, they do not readily lend themselves to applications outside of hospitals. Consequently, bilirubin monitoring for cirrhotic patients is often performed only intermittently; thus, episodes requiring clinical interventions could be missed. This work investigates the feasibility of measuring bilirubin concentration in whole porcine blood samples using dual-wavelength transmission measurement. A compact and low-cost dual-wavelength transmission measurement setup is developed and optimized to measure whole blood bilirubin concentrations. Using small volumes of whole porcine blood (72 {\mu}L), we measured the bilirubin concentration within a range corresponding to healthy individuals and cirrhotic patients (1.2-30 mg/dL). We demonstrate that bilirubin levels can be estimated with a positive correlation (R-square &gt; 0.95) and an accuracy of +/- 1.7 mg/dL, with higher reliability in cirrhotic bilirubin concentrations (&gt; 4 mg/dL), critical for high-risk patients. The optical and electronic components utilized are economical and can be readily integrated into a miniature, low-cost, and user-friendly system. This could provide a pathway for point-of-care monitoring of blood bilirubin outside of medical facilities.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Response of Ionic Current in Conical Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic current rectification (ICR) of charged conical nanopores has various applications in fields including nanofluidics, bio-sensing, and energy conversion, whose function is closely related to the dynamic response of nanopores. The occurrence of ICR originates from the ion enrichment and depletion in conical pores, whose formation is found to be affected by the scanning rate of voltages. Here, through time-dependent simulations, we investigate the variation of ion current under electric fields and the dynamic formation of ion enrichment and depletion, which can reflect the response time of conical nanopores. The response time of nanopores when ion enrichment forms i.e. at the on state is significantly longer than that with the formation of ion depletion i.e. at the off state. Our simulation results reveal the regulation of response time by different nanopore parameters including the surface charge density, pore length, tip, and base radius, as well as the applied conditions such as the voltage and bulk concentration. The response time of nanopores is closely related to the surface charge density, pore length, voltage, and bulk concentration. Our uncovered dynamic response mechanism of the ionic current can guide the design of nanofluidic devices with conical nanopores, including memristors, ionic switches, and rectifiers.</description>

      <title>The random walk of intermittently self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>
