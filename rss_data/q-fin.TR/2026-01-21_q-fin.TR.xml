      <title>Market Making and Transient Impact in Spot FX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dealers in foreign exchange markets provide bid and ask prices to their clients at which they are happy to buy and sell, respectively. To manage risk, dealers can skew their quotes and hedge in the interbank market. Hedging offers certainty but comes with transaction costs and market impact. Optimal market making with execution has previously been addressed within the Almgren-Chriss market impact model, which includes instantaneous and permanent components. However, there is overwhelming empirical evidence of the transient nature of market impact, with instantaneous and permanent impacts arising as the two limiting cases. In this note, we consider an intermediate scenario and study the interplay between risk management and impact resilience.</description>

      <title>A data-driven merit order: Learning a fundamental electricity price model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02963v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting approaches generally fall into two categories: data-driven models, which learn from historical patterns, or fundamental models, which simulate market mechanisms. We propose a novel and highly efficient data-driven merit order model that integrates both paradigms. The model embeds the classical expert-based merit order as a nested special case, allowing all key parameters, such as plant efficiencies, bidding behavior, and available capacities, to be estimated directly from historical data, rather than assumed. We further enhance the model with critical embedded extensions such as hydro power, cross-border flows and corrections for underreported capacities, which considerably improve forecasting accuracy. Applied to the German day-ahead market, our model outperforms both classic fundamental and state-of-the-art machine learning models. It retains the interpretability of fundamental models, offering insights into marginal technologies, fuel switches, and dispatch patterns, elements which are typically inaccessible to black-box machine learning approaches. This transparency and high computational efficiency make it a promising new direction for electricity price modeling.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Market Intelligence: Agentic AI Nowcasting Predicts Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can fully agentic AI nowcast stock returns? We deploy a state-of-the-art Large Language Model to evaluate the attractiveness of each Russell 1000 stock daily, starting from April 2025 when AI web interfaces enabled real-time search. Our data contribution is unique along three dimensions. First, the nowcasting framework is completely out-of-sample and free of look-ahead bias by construction: predictions are collected at the current edge of time, ensuring the AI has no knowledge of future outcomes. Second, this temporal design is irreproducible -- once the information environment passes, it can never be recreated. Third, our framework is 100% agentic: we do not feed the model news, disclosures, or curated text; it autonomously searches the web, filters sources, and synthesises information into quantitative predictions. We find that AI possesses genuine stock selection ability, but only for identifying top winners. Longing the 20 highest-ranked stocks generates a daily Fama-French five-factor plus momentum alpha of 18.4 basis points and an annualised Sharpe ratio of 2.43. Critically, these returns derive from an implementable strategy trading highly liquid Russell 1000 constituents, with transaction costs representing less than 10\% of gross alpha. However, this predictability is highly concentrated: expanding beyond the top tier rapidly dilutes alpha, and bottom-ranked stocks exhibit returns statistically indistinguishable from the market. We hypothesise that this asymmetry reflects online information structure: genuinely positive news generates coherent signals, while negative news is contaminated by strategic corporate obfuscation and social media noise.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>

      <title>Strategic Learning and Trading in Broker-Mediated Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study strategic interactions in a broker-mediated market in which agents learn and exploit each other's private information. A broker provides liquidity to an informed trader and to noise traders while managing inventory in a lit market. The informed trader infers the broker's trading activity in the lit market, while the broker estimates the trader's private signal. Information leakage in the client's trading flow generates economic value for the broker that is comparable in magnitude to transaction costs: the broker can speculate profitably and manage risk more effectively, which in turn adversely affects the informed trader's performance. Brokers therefore hold a strategic advantage over traders who rely solely on prices to filter information. When the broker only relies on prices rather than client trading flow to infer information, their trading performance becomes indistinguishable from the performance of a naive strategy that internalises noise flow, externalises informed flow, and offloads inventory at a constant rate.</description>
